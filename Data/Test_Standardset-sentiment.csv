Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good Food / Average Ambiance,positive,40,20-Jul-13,The food was really nice however their ambiance is not that great. The sweets are also delicious. Not many sweet shops in Little India hence you will find stuff here bit expensive.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,positive,50,11-Sep-18,Sashimi is fresh and it is one of the very few places that serve swordfish sashimi in their buffet. Food is served quickly so you don't have to worry about waiting even when it's crowded. And there is a wide variety to choose from.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Avoid unless you are going for the buffet,negative,20,19-Mar-12,"We have been here 4 times and in our opinion do not try unless you are going for the buffet, the food will take forever to arrive and the service is fine unless you complain and things turn frosty."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Food we had in Little India,positive,50,10-Jul-18,"We were group of 7 members, all Vegetarians and looking for some good options for dinner. One of my local friend suggested about this place. And her suggestion was absolutely right. We get the best veg food with authentic Indian taste and lots of veg options here. Delicious food.. Little costly but taste recover all."
French,Saveur,Small servings,negative,30,27-Mar-16,There was a party of 8 and it was our first visit.the food is average priced but in small portions.a few of us did not have enough from our own main entree.There was limited selection of beverages and desserts.This would be an alternative venue instead of a choice.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only value for money if there's voucher,negative,20,26-Feb-17,"There are varieties of food available but the quality is mediocre. If there's no birthday voucher to be used during this visit, it's not worth your effort and calories to visit this restaurant. Totally has no idea how this restaurant won the best buffet restaurant of the year. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A real dining experience!,positive,50,10-Feb-15,"This was one of my best meals ever! I had been to Tetsuya's restaurant in Sydney and was blown away by that experience, so I thought I would treat my girlfriend to a dinner at Waku Ghin. The meal was an amazing experience. The service was exceptional and the professionalism of the staff was impressive. We were lucky to get a great table where the Sous Chef himself cooked for us! Wow! No menu, beautiful seafood that is presented to you prior to your dinner, and course after course of wonderfully cooked and unadulterated food! The attention to detail is amazing! From the choice of tableware, ingredients, to even serving Gyokuro tea! My hat goes off! The sake sommelier was an extremely nice touch also! Would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore. The highlight of the meal for me was definitely the urchins!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good honest steak in a relaxing setting,positive,40,18-Apr-13,"I have been here before, but stopped by again last night for a steak, together with a client. We took a table outside, to soak in the atmosphere of the Singapore river. The menu is short, but the food is well executed and geared towards steaks. I had a rib eye steak and my colleague had lamb skewers, both of which came with a mixed salad served beforehand. I ordered my steak rare, and it came just as ordered. We were debating whether to have a starter, but I am glad we didn't because the portions are generous. Fries came as ""free-flow"", which is a bit of a gimmick, because I don't know anyone who has actually finished the first portion! The wine list contains a selection of good wines under S$100 a bottle. Dinner for two with a bottle of good red wine was just under Sin$200, which in Singapore is pretty reasonable value for what you get.I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good, honest steak in a relaxing setting."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Basic,negative,30,04/28/16,"tried this at waterwaypoint mall (Punggol) ordered the signature duck congee and duck platter. food was basic so as the presentation. tasted clean though which was good.service was average. not friendly, not snobbish either. would be a good place to eat if you're just looking for something to fill the stomach but not really for culinary pleasure."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Yum! ,positive,50,28-Jan-18,"We visited Kailash Parbat for a family dinner during our vacation to Singapore. We went there primarily as it was a vegetarian restaurant. The ambience is just about good and located in Little India were competing options are available. We had kids and ordered for Paneer kofta, roti, dal and jeera rice. The kofta was excellent and the tandoori roti was just about perfect. The service was superfast. A little pricey, but worth the wonderful experience and taste, expect about 25SGD per person at least. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,50,12-Feb-17,Excellent food and service. Will definitely be visiting this restaurant again next with my family members.
French,Saveur,Good food at affordable price,positive,50,17-Sep-16,Been twice and both times were great. Love the dinner set which is priced reasonably at $29.90++. Great quality and taste for the price!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Birthday lunch,positive,50,03/18/17,"Peking duck was awesome and crispy and the crepes were placed on top of a steamer. Had a few other dishes, fried prawns in cheesy sauce, roast pork, fried oatmeal doufu, salted egg yolk soft shell crab, fried squid tentacles. Which were all very good.Do not miss these 2 other dishes, seafood horfun(half of which was stir fried but the other half deep fried - very delicious and unique) and stir fried scallops with celery and macadamia nuts which was bursting with wok-hei.Staff are very polite and attentive - will definitely visit again"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good South Indian Food in Singapore,positive,40,2-Jun-14,Ananda Bhavan in Little India is a good place to have food after a tiring shopping session at Mustafa! Tasty South Indian food at reasonable price is what you expect there. It's a crowded place so don't expect a soothing ambiance - the taste of...More
French,Saveur,A bit disappointed,negative,30,5-Apr-17,Food quality has decreased from the first time we tried. Quite disappointed. Duck confit was not as good as before and that's what we came back for
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glorious food ,positive,50,3-May-16,"Still one of the best restaurants on the planet ... Food, atmosphere and attention by staff is fantastic .. A must on your dinning experience list"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dimsum in Chinatown,positive,40,12/31/13,"There are several dim sum restaurants in Chinatown - this one stands out for several reasons.1. Ambience is the best of the lot, with the look and feel of a classy Chinese restaurant.2. It attracts the most tourists. Expect long queues during peak hours esp. Weekends.Dim sum is generally good - standout dishes being the fried glutinous rice, custard dumpling and steamed beef balls.Prices have been steadily increasing and a dim sum meal for two should be about $40-$50 now.Service can be compromised on peak days with urgency to clear the queue as quickly as possible."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Dinner after shopping ,positive,40,10-Apr-18,"Nice South Indian and North Indian combo food.
It’s just opponents to Mustafa shopping centre.
Enjoyed the South Indian me there."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim Sum Lunch,positive,50,11/21/17,Had lunch at Peach Blossoms with family. Service was excellent and the staff were very helpful in making recommendations with the dim sum variety. Food was very good and price reasonable. Will definitely eat at the restaurant again. Keep up the good work!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",More a branding and marketing exercise,negative,20,26-Oct-17,"Extremely disappointed – as someone who had enjoyed Tetsuya’s food for decades from his early days at Rozelle, it was a total letdown. Of the many meals we have had at Tetsuya’s this wouldn’t rank in the top 50.The rating reflects more the $ charged and the lack of meeting expectations – the food had a certain quality but not to be compared with Andre, Nouri, Odette’s, Blackwattle etc. where we had dined the previous few days.It’s not though that we created these expectations, they promote Tetsuya Wakuda extensively and you naturally make some assumptions.As the Marina Bay Sands says “With its long list of awards, Waku Ghin is universally acclaimed as one of the very best restaurants in Singapore. Tetsuya Wakuda’s masterful European Japanese dishes are created in front of diners’ eyes by personal chefs for an unmatched fine dining experience”I’ve eaten at so many of the world’s best Chefs Tables in the past couple of years and this doesn’t compare.Typically, the chef does everything in front of you from showing the produce, to preparation, then cooking and presentation to the diner – all the while involving the diner and discussing what he is doing.At Waku Ghin, not only was the chef relatively young (and by comparison to Tetsuya, inexperienced) but he rarely talked and seemed almost embarrassed being asked questions.There was no interaction and no involvement that perhaps would have made it worth half the money.The dishes were not created in front of us, the preparation was done in an outside kitchen and then brought to the bench in front of us where the young chef played and then served without communication.In our home town, have enjoyed Raita where all my expectations have been met at less than half the price and the seafood has been even fresher.Tetsuya should be embarrassed – the final insult was the finishing touch of giving my wife a fruit jelly."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good place for families'/friends' gathering,negative,30,14-Feb-17,Good hangout place for get together. A good variety of food selection but average tasting for food..the food serving time was quite long due to understaffing.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Loving Shinji,positive,50,23-Dec-13,"I went to Shinji with my Dad's Japanese business partner. I have heard this place so many times but never had the time to try. Finally i could so..was excited because i love Japanese sushi sashimi a lot. Only fools don't like Japanese food lol it is healthy it is artistry. Anyway, all sushi sashimi were prepared specially by the Itamae and the menu was never-ending!! I will always go back to Shinji! "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very Good Service,positive,50,9/10/2016,The team which serve my family is very good.They find out who is the birthday girl and decorated the cake for her.They are very friendly and helpful to our needs.Food is good too.That's why I go there for family gathering every year.Great job!Team:TerryNobelChristine TeohAlicia
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Yummy food, best idllis in town, service needs improvement ",positive,40,23-Apr-16,Definitely the best idllis and dosas in towns and a must visit. Understand they have a lot of customers and super busy but would be nice if the staff is a bit more friendly.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Thought we were being filmed for a prank,negative,10,8/11/2013,"We went to this restaurant on 10th August as part of a Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour and it was supposed to be a Chinese Dinner......however it was just a joke...the staff were downright rude, the 4 courses of food were put down all the same time from the soup to the mango pudding...they were reluctant to lift dirty plates away....a table of 9 people and no lazy susan to pass the food around which had been ""dumped"" on the table with no explanation.....we also had plastic cutlery and the money for the drinks which were not included in the pre paid trip was demanded whilst we were still eating by a sour faced waitress.....the food was pretty awful, it was bland and also cold when it arrived.......I would not recommend this place....I kept waiting on someone jumping out and saying we had been ""pranked""...just a joke......."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to experience Asian food,positive,40,30-Aug-15,"Had been to this place as it was recommended by several friends and found it really nice, I tried fish head curry (not remembering the stall name) and it was niceIf you are staying in Singapore for long then can mark this place as ""to visit"""
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Expensive, touristy and hot!",negative,30,21-Aug-16,"It's one of the obligatory stops when bringing tourists around Singapore. This one is just off the Newton MRT stop (one away from Orchard) and is almost always packed - not with locals but with tourists. Yes, the cereal prawns are tasty, the satay tender and salted egg crab really yummy but if one would cost SG$60++, then I will have to refrain from coming back. If you find yourself here, best to look for a table ans order from any of the establishments circling the center. The ""uncles"" would gladly cook your orders and deliver them to your table. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious!,positive,50,9-Apr-17,There is a wide variety of food. Service is fast in serving the food and they are fresh and delicious too!
French,Saveur,"Honest staff, quick service and yet still good food",negative,30,18-Jun-17,"I went for last Friday lunch. The food is served 15 min after order. Quality of food is good. When we left, an honest staff ran out to return $2 note to us which he found on the floor. It was belonged to one of my colleagues there. Thanks for the honesty. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pure Veg heaven in Singapore,positive,40,20-Sep-15,"KP you are doing fantastic job to fill pure veggie tummies like mine.. Everything is good, but one thing for sure you must look into is stinking paneer its not good really. I am a frequent visitor at Chennai. I dont expect typical stuff but panner is horrible plz plz look into this.I am here now 19 Sept to 24 sept for lunch and dinner only here. I am tasting all things its quite good except paneer."
French,L_Angelus,Absolutely Phenomenal Restaurant.,positive,50,24-Mar-17,"The food in L'Angelus is absolutely phenomenal. Great restaurant with really good flower decoration from outside view. The service was excellent and the Chinese lady who is serving is the friendliest and most professional i ever seen in any Singaporean restaurant. I ordered as appetizer the Roasted Chavignol Goat Cheese and Salad on Walnut Bread Toasts and it was 'WOW'.As mains , i ordered Marinated Lamb Racks , Ratatouille and Mashed Purple Potatoes and Lamb it melts in the mouth. Really a great chef.So far , this is the best french restaurant i ever been in my life.Dinner 23.3.2017"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's all about the crab,positive,40,11/15/16,"To eat crab and really enjoy it you have to get down and dirty. There's no way to not use your fingers. Without a proper protective bib you will ruin or at least stain whatever you happen to be wearing. Bibs are thoughtfully provided and discreetly tied around your neck here at Long Beach. And they are very necessary since you will want to get down and dirty with these crabs. The two kinds of crab we tried were the chili crab and the pepper crab, and I would recommend trying both. Sometimes chili crab can be so spicy that you miss the flavor of the succulent meat. I thought they got the spice just right here since it was spicy, but not so spicy that you didn't appreciate the high-quality of the crab. Both were delicious. A fresh shrimp starter was also delicious. The seafood is kept in gigantic tanks in the restaurant so freshness is guaranteed. A noodle dish we ordered late in the game was not quite on the same level. However, you come here to eat seafood not noodles. The restaurant is a bit out-of-the-way but taxis are very reasonable in Singapore. I think chili crab is a must to try here and this would be a great place to do it. Wash it down with your beer of choice. On a sidenote don't bother with the Singapore sling. I think it tastes like chewed bubblegum. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",VERY OIL FOOD,negative,20,12-Jan-16,"had the chhole bhature here after hearing really good reviews.
But after the meal i felt like i drank a pint of refined oil"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good chaat papdi and choley bhature,positive,50,30-Dec-15,"Visited recently

Excellent bhaturas. ---- 4 different flavours
Plain paneer masala and methi
Huge serve if channas(chickpeas)
And onion salad

Very happy chappy restaurant men and lovely friendly service"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super sea food !,positive,50,02/22/16,Long beach is ideal place for Chinese sea food lovers and a great hangout place for team and group dinners with quality beer and wine. We ordered lobsters and crab and it was awesome.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Love the food!,positive,40,10-Nov-14,"why would anyone else go to a hawker center if the food is not good? the food there is great, but it's a bit dark and could use a bit more lighting"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to take your visitors.,positive,40,2/5/2015,"it is in china town, a bit diffiult to find the entrance, specially during Chines New Year with so many stalls. but it is good place for dimsums . They still go around the restaurant with trolleys showing off the food. So jut pick inside the bamboo box and choose what you fancy most. very reasonable priced, Quality is fine but not the fine dinning level.No reservation on saturday or sunday. Just send an advance person to start the queue. Nice place for a family gathering or with friends."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and yummy,positive,50,17-Oct-16,"I've searched this hawker food here in TripAdvisor and satisfied with the reviews so I decided to have a visit. The place was so clean and they offer lots of food variety, name it and I'm sure they have it here. From noodles to rice chicken and duck. I'm telling you this is a must try if you are visiting Singapore try hawker food it's cheap like 5 to 10 SGD only for a complete heavy set of meal with a nice shakes! You're missing something in Singapore if you don't try this one "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Dim Sum Restaurant,positive,50,06/21/18,A real treat if your visiting China Town. Its located on 2nd floor. A true foodie pit stop you must experience.
French,L_Angelus,An oldy but a goody,positive,40,15-May-14,"I hadn't been to L'Angelus in years I have to say but having been back I have since been back again.L'Angelus does simple things well and in an entirely unfussy way whilst making you feel that everything is in it's proper place.Portions are more than ample, the wine list is adequate if not entirely thorough and service is brisk but efficient and knowledgable. There are more modern alternatives but for straightforward French fare, L'Angelus ticks the boxes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat duck was skinny.....,negative,30,08/18/16,"Maybe they ran out of fat ducks....but ours was not especially juicy and fat like those in London. ...
Maybe they have lost their magic......
Duck also was that tasty....no different from what we can get from the food courts...."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Yes for the best in Class Street Food,positive,40,28-May-14,"You name it and there! You have the tongue titilling, very nicely presented food ranging from Pani Puri to Pav Bhaji.
There is a College Sandwich which sure would remind you of your college cafe's. Tastes really nice."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome chaat,positive,40,4-Feb-16,"Whenever i feel home sick, i go to this place for good chaat ..
Especially
Pani puri
College grill sandwich
Food is really good.. All the products are very well served and has good quality.."
French,Paul,Poor service and attitude,negative,10,2-Apr-13,"Had afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon... long wait for a table.Ordered tea... Tea came in a teapot which had too much water for 1 teabag. Found that out when I poured my tea, it was like dishwater .And water was not hot enough. When asked for a another teabag was told had to pay for it. I pointed out that they had put too much water in the pot for one bag and that is why I wanted another bag, we asked to speak to the manager, waiter walked away, eventually we flagged down the waiter that took our order and spoke to him about the problem with the tea, I asked for a replacement pot with a lot less water, which he obliged he then proceeded to tell me not to put so much milk in my tea!!! I usually visit Paul when in Singapore, on my previous visits the service has been good but this time will be the last time. But does it matter to them...I doubt it.. judging by the line waiting to go in and the attitude of the staff."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",a busy busy restaurant,positive,40,23-Apr-13,The poongal and vada tasted excellent. The 3 different chutneys and sambar was being topped up regularly. There is so much crowd that it might take time to find a seat!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",good vegetarian Indian food,positive,40,24-Sep-15,In Little there are many many Indian restaurants to choose from. This one has good clean ambiance and good quality Indian vegetarian food. A bit pricey though.
French,Saveur,another trip,negative,30,17-Jun-16,"the foie gras was not as crispy as it was supposed to be. duck confit was nice as usual. the beef tenderloin was superb. aft the meal i felt cheated tho as i wanted to choose my preferred seats but they said other seats were reserved, yet i also did make a reservation but was given some random seats. ironic isnt it. causes the experience to dim a little. not that i was being fussy on that day."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lousy Service!,negative,20,03/14/13,"This is probably the oldest and most established Crystal Jade, but now it's one of the most disappointing ""fine-dining"" outlets. It's ok that we have to queue for this seemingly popular restaurant, but to be ushered in like refugees, asked to order food quickly, and being served in a hurried manner AND worst of all, no smile, made one lose appetite. I'm not even talking about the weekend crowd! Worst of the lot are the managers dressed in black suits. The most friendly people are the older lady waiters. Food standards have also dropped, and mind you, I've eaten here since its opening!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",10-Oct,positive,50,24-May-18,"This was our number one choice while visiting Singapore, it didn’t disappoint. We read reviews from others commenting on the price but I felt it was worth every penny. Fantastic having an interactive chef, food was delicious and the wine pairing was perfect. The head sommelier was amazing. We will definitely return if we visit Singapore again and I recommend this place to everyone."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Hana lunch set,positive,50,8-Jul-18,Shinji isn’t cheap at all but I decided I just had to try it. The best way to do this without getting too badly gouged is through the Hana lunch set: 9 pieces of sushi for $75++. Service and food quality are excellent. I was able to walk in on a weekday without a reservation. I would love to try the more expensive options but will save that for a special occasion. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Restaurant but bad Service,positive,40,19-Apr-14,"I have been there just once and will never go back, I had visited during dinner on a weekday, but the service staff was too slow, there was not much of crowd too.We have to remind the service staff about our order as they are a bit forgetful.Recommended but only visit this restaurant if you have ample time to spend"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cheesy tourist trap,negative,20,5/6/2013,"Don't fall for this one - despite the concierge's best efforts to convince me that locals still come here, my insticts told me otherwise. Should've gone with the gut as the food was mediocre and service even worse. Have a feeling that chili crab can be had at a better value and quality elsewhere. Anywhere but Long Beach @ Dempsey!!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very average food and terrible service,negative,10,9-Aug-16,Thought of having snacks and tea so went there to a known place I have visited for years..this time round it was a public holiday and the place was not crowded at all..asked the staff about an item in the menu and he said it's written there just see it yourself! Each item took forever to arrive and it didn't taste as good as it used to.. Even their famous paani puri has become terrible! Staff were walking around and didn't pay attention when I call them..after the first dish everything took forever to arrive...tea wouldn't have arrived if I didn't remind and it was not even hot... Overall a big disappointment and won't bother going back there again!
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good portions ,negative,30,11-Jul-18,"Myself and my husband called in here last night for a steak and the portion was massive, front of house wasn’t the best felt like they didn’t need our custom but Tom he food was good and very big portion. I did ask for a medium steak but it was more rare for my liking. I would advise well done if you don’t like it dripping in blood "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit Mrs Tan at no 70.,positive,40,21-Sep-15,"To get a really good experience of a Singapore food court, visit the Newton Hawker centre. I have been there a couple of times now and the food is good. I particularly like Mrs Tan at no.70, especially if you like seafood. The beers & drinks are supplied from next door. Word of warning...you will get inundated by people trying to sell you there food....don't accept the first person, take a good look. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Terrible service.,negative,20,3-Mar-12,"I went to this hawker centre a few times. All the previous visits were fine. However, when I went with my mom to a particular Malay stall in December 2011, my mom complained that we waited the food for over 10 to 15 minutes, but the lady boss just told my mom to be patient. After that remark, my mom and I never go back to that stall again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi till e last dish is too chunky,positive,40,17-Feb-17,Food is good initially. Seem the chefs are lazy or not professional. The last dish is inedible as it's big chunks of raw fish which after one mouth full. You can feel like vomit cos the raw fish juice are too much. Shall cut thinner like the initial dish out. Overall ok . Jus the last dish of sashimi standard dropped n wasted the food. How can a chef cut the raw fish into so big chunks?
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Consistent Food Quality,positive,40,17-Aug-17,This restaurant is one of our favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. The quality of food is really amazing! They always ensure that patrons can enjoy promotion like Birthday Treats.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection,positive,50,21-Jan-13,My favourite place for Sting Ray. Like many of the Hawker Centres in Singapore the seating is basic but oh the food! Get a taste of how the locals dine out. :-)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Abundance of food at reasonable price,positive,40,20-Sep-17,Good quality food and attentive service. Good cut of Sashimi and fresh. Don't miss the Fried chicken. However the grilled items with salt needed more flavouring. No dessert included for buffet.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but very touristic,negative,30,21-May-13,"The food here is nice, but for a Hawker Centre it is overpriced as they know many tourists come here. You can also find better food at a cheaper price in other Hawkers."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Good, fresh quality food",negative,30,23-Jul-12,"For the price that we are paying, we are expecting more than just fresh quality food. The few memorable dish we had was the appetizer made with Uni, botan shrimps and good caviar. The combination of salty caviar brings out the sweetness of the uni and shrimps.... divine. The other was the Omi beef from Japan. It is well marbled and grilled slightly plain with a pinch of salt. The taste was sweet and has a pleasant fragrance without the need for any seasoning. The meat was very tender and the fat just melts in the mouth. This is the next best thing to Kobe beef which we can never find outside of Japan. Lastly, the sake that was recommended by the sommelier was excellent. We could not have enough of it. Food wise, it is definitely above the average sushi restaurant but in terms of creativity, is was a tad predictable. The restaurant has a very sombre ambiance and the chef is very serious and quiet. Not a place for playful banter or party unless you book the whole place. It is definitely romantic enough to bring a date to."
French,Saveur,Good food but I'm annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy,negative,30,14-Apr-17,Food was delicious and good value for money but I was annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy and so won't be patronizing again.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),the worst Chinese meal we have ever had!,negative,20,09/20/14,"our first night at the hotel and to celebrate we thought we would have a good Chinese meal at Peach Blossom. The broccoli was over cooked, the spring rolls were soggy, the rice tasted like it had been cooked in old oil, the prawns in egg tasted like they had been rolled in sand first but the worst thing was that although we had left more than 80% of our meal not once were we asked if everything was ok!! very disappointing...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Essential For Experiencing Singapore,positive,50,2-Feb-16,"I consider this Hawker Food Centre a ''Must'' to visit every time I'm in Singapore . The choice of regional dishes is very large indeed , and I'm never disappointed , regardless of what I elect to eat any particular evening ... be it Thai , or Indian or the standard Singaporian noodle dishes in any of their many varieties . Fish , meat , fowl , or vegetarian , it all seems good to me ! Price per basic dish is almost invariably under $10 , and satay costs 70cents a stick . Plenty of choice of drinks , tho' I invariably go for the freshly opened coconut + a straw while waiting for my order of food to be served .The layout of this Centre has changed very considerably from its previous format . The hawker food stalls are arranged around a central open air eating area ( though there is a fair amount of covered eating available if it rains ) . One would do well to check the weather forecast on the excellent local web site NEA-MISS before going ! I recommend taking a stroll round all the stalls in the outer perimeter to see what takes one's fancy . Do not be pressurised by any vendor into taking a seat alongside his particular stall until you've made up you mind ( or unless you are by yourself ) . Otherwise pick seating for yourselves , preferably in the central open area , before you go and order any dish .... but you MUST remember your table number to place your order ( and exactly where it is , so YOU can find your way back to it again ) Leave one of you at the table to ''reserve'' your seats while the other(s) place orders .I've always found the food quality very good , and frequently excellent , but it's a matter of personal taste , and sometimes of luck . What is encouraging is the number of ''locals'' packing into the place for an evening meal . Extremely easy to get to . Take the MRT to Newton station , and it's a 5 minute walk from there . Savour the food as much as you'll enjoy the buzz of the experience . Enjoy !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Decent Meat, Average Service",negative,30,15-May-15,"Certainly doesn't compare to L'entrecote in other countries, but it's the best Singapore has to offer. Not generous with 2nd servings, and they refused to let me take my leftovers home for my dog because they were scared of liability (food poisoning), even if it was for animal consumption. I even gave consent and accepted the consequences but they still wouldn't let me do a doggy bag. Not a happy customer, but if you're craving L'entrecote- go here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best chats and snacks,positive,50,11-Sep-14,"Kailash parbat is known for its yummy chats. We tried twice on its outlet opposite mustafa centre, it was indeed delicious. Chat platter is highly recommended, they give 4 varities in platter.Also their must try is Chole bhatoore and Malai Rabri. Rabri is excellent and fresh.Worth a visit with family for quick snacks."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Second time around and just as good,positive,40,11-Sep-12,"We like the Duxton Hill area of Singapore and L'Entrcote is a great spot for a meal - as long as you like steak and fries! The restaurant does tend to have the tables close together, but both times we were the it was 50% full and perfectly fine. Nice touch is that salad comes first as a starter and there is a second portion of steak coming your way too."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Always a sure thing,positive,40,26-Oct-13,"Been going very regularly at Les Bouchons, every time I crave for a simple but very efficient meal. The ""steak frites"" is just excellent. Served perfectly grilled, withe a nut of butter atop. The french fries are home made, not these frozen stuff served in most restaurants. Sauces are the immortal mayonnaise and béarnaise. As a starter they serve you a well balanced green salad with wholenuts. They could do a little bit better with the wine per glass's quality. Nice terrace which brings the perfect atmosphere to share a simple dinner, at a very reasonable price, with some friends. An excellent ratio quality/price which never deceive."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Celebrating my Son's birthday ,positive,40,01/19/18,We have been coming back here every year for birthdays and anniversaries celebration. Their high quality of food and services have been consistent.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good Indian Vegetarian,positive,40,18-Nov-15,"After our shopping expedition in the area, my wife and I decided on a late lunch at this bustling restaurant.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Had bigger expectations of this steakhouse,negative,30,11-Jan-15,"I spent some time reviewing steak restaurants before settling upon L'Entrecote. The restaurant itself is a great little place, in Duxton Hill, and the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant was fabulous, quaint old lights, walls lined with bottles. Very atmospheric. The menu is simple but expected. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Regrettably the food however, was not quite up to expectations. The French onion soup was piping hot, and looked every inch like a tasty bowl of soup, but unfortunately there seemed to be very few onions and it was quite watery, definitely not what I was expecting. The steak came with the sauce poured all over it. I did not appreciate this, I had expected this to be in a separate jug so that I could pour. I did not enjoy the sauce but that is my taste I guess. The steak was quite tough and chewy and disappointing. Such a shame as the restaurant looked so promising. My usual test of a good restaurant is whether I would pay a return visit. In this instance I'm afraid not."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Superb Dining Experience at Peach Blossoms,positive,50,06/19/17,"Had the pleasure of celebrating my Dad's Birthday (together with Father's Day) last Friday evening at Peach Blossoms and as usual, the restaurant delivered beyond expectations.Despite the large dinner crowd, service was prompt, impeccable and always delivered with a smile. My parents were effusive in their praise of Mr Alden Gan and his service crew and that set the tone for an excellent evening,Food was exquisite and delicious, justifying its reputation as one of the leading chinese restaurants in Singapore.Thanks for a wonderful evening Peach Blossoms!"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",What a joke !,negative,20,23-Dec-17,"Everything is in the title... Good products for sure, but almost no work on them, same menu since day one, those small ""Teppanyaki rooms"" where the Teppanyaki is almost not used, but the exhaust noise above your head is working well, maybe to break the ice cold ambiance in this restaurant. Nothing that my palate will remember. But a paradise for all the people who eat with their eyes (and mostly social network junky).The only thing I will not forget, is the bill..."

I passed it, looked at the menu and thought ""Why not?""Good decision. After being well welcomed, I decided to go for the duck and ordered a bottle of red bojo (chilled, perfect)The chef came out to chat and how specifically I wanted my duck cooked. Nice touch and shows a good sense of precision and service.It arrived absolutely spot on. Delicious. And with the most perfect fries, à volonté, everyone's a winner.Lovely food, lovely wine and great service. I couldn't finish a whole bottle of bojo so sent a glass in to the chef to say thanks. Hope he enjoyed it. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sums with some great varieties,positive,40,3/10/2015,Excellent dim sums with some good varieties - particularly for someone like me visiting from the UK. Be prepared to wait in a queue on the weekends but it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. Essentially the restaurant serves dim sums on a trolley and one just picks their selection. Had some different varieties like squid ink dim sums which were delicious! The pastry around the dim sums was thin and well made.Service was no different than any other average Chinese restaurant.All in all worth a visit on the weekends...
French,Saveur,First time to Cathay outlet,negative,30,26-Sep-16,"The place is cosy. And the food standard is the same as Purvis and Far East. One of the server is quite attentive, when my friends finish their wine, she came over to serve them without us asking for any help."

French,Poulet,Salty and costly food,negative,20,10-Jan-15,"Maybe it's our taste buds. But both my wife and I found the food to be rather salty. We both also had a feeling of wanting to throw up after the meal. Customer service was bad. Before clearing the used plates on the tables, they brought in another set of food and there was no place to put them on the table. Water is chargeable at 50 cents per glass. Came with high expectation but going off with dissatisfaction. Total bill was rather costly for two pax. "

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dumplings!!! ,positive,40,08/17/14,"I got this restaurant recommended by a local friend and went twice during a one week visit to Singapore. Yum Cha Restaurant is located in the heart of China Town. Both times I had a great dining experience, but I must say I enjoyed the second most, as it had a different set-up. First time I visited the restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon and we were served from a menu. The second time I visited it on a Saturday during lunch time and servers were passing by pushing trolleys with different dumpling you could choose from. Loved the fact you could actually see how the dumpling look like before choosing. The restaurant was both times packed with locals and expect to wait for a table, specially during lunch time. "

His reply was the most ridiculous & absurd reply we ever heard. His reply was chopsticks are only given for food order, at that moment we were like, you mean Yusheng is not food?!Then he continued he ridiculousness, by saying we don’t normally give chopsticks for Yusheng because all people buy home to eat mah & house sure got chopsticks what. We were speechless by such ignorance assumptions & bad attitude."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food!,positive,40,12-Apr-17,"With lots of variety of food. The food is delicious. But some of the tables are too close to each other, make one of my friend feel uncomfortable."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check price before ordering,positive,40,31-Dec-14,"Even as a local, I seldom come here to dine as its too touristy and expensive. You can get better quality at cheaper price elsewhere.But the centralized location and atmosphere is good, windy and spacious. Do take note of menu priced as $X/100 grams. These are usually those that rip you off. Or just make sure you ask and confirm the pricing before ordering. Now I see most of the stalls have changed the menu to a fixed pricing. What I've order:Sambal kangkong, fried honey baby squids, sambal stingray, satay, sugar cane juice, fried carrot cake, cereal prawns - total bill of approximately SGD$85 for two pax. Enjoy Singapore!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for those foodies,positive,40,24-Feb-15,"I visited here last year after being recommended to go by my cousin living there. We were taken to her favourite stall and the food was delicious. Being of ethnic origin we did get stared at, however because we knew what it was we wanted to eat and acted accordingly, we were not bothered by any other stalls. There were a total of 6 of us in our group and the food was plentiful and reasonably priced. I would definatly reccomend here if you want to try good local dishes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food and Fast Service,positive,40,14-Feb-17,Food served at Shin Minori is fresh and their service is fast. Sashimi sliced a little too thick. Almost double of what we get in other Japanese restaurants. I personally prefer it to be slightly thinner.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awful service,negative,10,10/1/2008,"Before I start, I am asian and have eaten all over so my standards for what I expect aren't that high! I went to a long beach restaurant, waited 10 minutes to be seated and then 10 mins after ordering was told they were out of crab and I'd have to wait 1 hour before they could get some!I told them I'd wait but to bring out the rest of the dishes I'd ordered, after all I'd come all the way to try the black pepper and chilli crab. Another 10 minutes later, I was told I might have to wait 2 hours so I decided to pack up and leave. The staff were courteous, picked the bill off my table and crossed my orders out.They told me to head to the east coast store, so off I went in a taxi. On arrival, I found that they had called in advance to tell them to charge me for the drinks (all $6 worth!) from the last place!Service was slow, and not courteous for the rest of the meal.Overall, the food is pretty good, the black pepper crab is special but the chilli crab is no better than any other place on the east coast.I would highly recommend NOT ever going to this place."

Indoor and outdoor seating Service staffs are friendly and efficient . Even though she warn us the crab will take 30 minutes to cook we got the dishes at 15 min but then again we went at 10.30 pm Black pepper crab was charged at $88 kilo . It has overpowering peppery taste and very salty . Chillie crab was charged same at $88 per kilo . It has sweet sauce with touch of lemongrass , onion garlic and lemon . Nice sauce to go with dumpling Frankly the peppery and chillie sauce killed the sweet taste of crab "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent Situation Management,positive,50,3/3/2014,"Not quite a crisis, but it was an unexpected situation that excellently managed by the restaurant staffs and making things amicable for the diners.I was having my birthday dinner at the restaurant on 2/Mar, just as we have started the dinner, suddenly some lights went off and next to minimum light source, by then the restaurant staff informed us there was a fire on the same floor and restaurant kitchen need to cease operation right away, so our dinner have to be discontinued. The staffs quickly offered us to dine at alternate restaurant on the next floor, so that the celebration will not be affected.when we got to the next floor restaurant, everything have set up for us nicely, complimentary wines were provided as a gesture for the inconvenience caused. best of all, we also need not pay for the meals....a wonderful way of customer relationship management.Like to place on record for this commendable action by the restaurant staffs."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, delivered Fast!",positive,50,05/31/16,"Had lunch with 4 other colleagues, good and value for money tim sum. Great Roast Duck, its really fat.. juicy and flavourful. The Hong Kong style noodles were good too. Mixed review of the Roast Char Siew as well as the signature Pandan liu sha Bao.. I love them both but not my colleagues.The crab porridge was good :)Total damage $131 for 5 persons, I think its really affordable, bearing in mind the amount of food we ate.We were seated at a corner, and found it difficult to capture the attention of the service staff. But when served, they were friendly and assisted accordingly. Food service was really fast, and fresh! Only one gripe, throw the jumpy CD that you are using, its jumps really badly and is an ear-sore! Will definitely be back!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Poor Marketing Collaboration,negative,30,21-Apr-17,"i have dined at Shinji at Raffles 3 times before, so on invitation of UOB Bank, I have my dinner this time at the Carlton location. I was reminded by my bank manager it's a $300 pp dinner menu, so I look forward to another great experience at Shinji.But I was very disappointed by the outcome, dishes served may have still maintained the standard, but I was surprised that I didn't get a slice of Toro and total dishes served were much lees that lunch in a cheaper menu.On my way out, I questioned the staff on my doubts that the menu worth $300pp, she quickly show me the menu starting price at $300pp, but I asked her why no Toro, no certain hot dishes I used to get etc, she was unable to comments as this is a marketing agreement with the bank etc.Actually I already suspected this kind of marketing dinner will be a modified menu though they claimed at certain price menu. My disappointment is that a premium Michelin star restaurant should not participate such kind of event, but if chose to do it, should serve the exact menu offering as usual but not modified it.Also the Chef is not as sociable as other top end sushi place like Hashida."

It didn't occur to me to check the menu in advance but there are VERY limited options for vegetarians - basically onion soup, salad and fries.The meat eaters in our group enjoyed the steak, though it was a bit chewy and didn't seem to be a great cut of meat. However we enjoyed the ambiance, fries, and house wine. Welcome drinks were a nice touch. Service was great (though there were only 2 other diners at the time we were there).I'd come here again with friends instead of kids and soak up the ambiance. :)"

The food taste was quite contrast from what is offered in India. Also, the portions where inconsistent. Further, the variety of chaat in menu card was limited. Overall, an average experience.

We ordered a chaat platter, which was excellent. That is what it is good at and one should stick to that.We saw a promo of the week on our table - Punjabi Dhaba at lunch. We greedily went for 'sarson ka saag' (mustard spinach) with 'makai ki roti' (corn bread) & gajar ka halwa (carrot dessert) and lassi.I mentioned to our son that the Punjabi Dhaba was a failure. His immediate response was, 'you failed falling for Punjabi food in a Bombay savoury (chaat) house. Sure our fault. The stuff was not fit for human consumption - Yucky.

French,Paul,Worst restaurant in Orchard road,negative,10,13-Jun-17,"We had afternoon tea time at the paragon outlet. There were only 3 tables occupied and already been served. We ordered pancake and sandwich. We waited 40 min for our food , our coffee were lukewarm and diluted. Waiters were not interested even if we waved and called 'excuse me'. This is my worst experience in Singapore, bad service and food quality."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super delicious seafood cuisine,positive,50,7/1/2015,"A big thumbs up for the service and food. First of all, surroundings fantastic. Restaurant set among old colonial buildings in Orchard area. Though a bit remote to reach without a car but a great place to visit to have a totally different feel . Food is super delicious . Crabs are really fresh and cooked to the right texture and taste. A must try is the black pepper crab and the salted egg crab. Though slightly pricey, but it is still worth it. Recommended strongly especially for a great family day out."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore","Soggy rice, cold curry",negative,20,6-Nov-12,"Visited the Suntec branch with friend for lunch. We got there early hence it was rather empty. Ordered two curry dishes with white rice.
Pappadum was available while we wait for our meal. It's tasty but gets soft really fast.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good and plenty of food choices, nowadays also easier to get a table",positive,40,23-Oct-16,"Newton Hawker Centre is/was always popular with foreigners ,tourist and expat alike, which live nearby or in CBD area. This explains also why its more expansive compare to other Hawker centres. Food quality and choice is good and tasty and nowadays you get a table faster then before."
French,Saveur,SAVEUR PURVIS STREET is better,negative,30,3-Oct-16,"I've been to the SAVEUR PURVIS STREET before and enjoyed the quality dishes and nice service. But the service at the Cathay is quite disappointing. At first, when we were ordering a bottle of red wine, the waitress recommended us the 1 for 1 glass of wine, so we ordered 4 glasses of red and white wine. After serving 2 glasses of red and white wine, the same waitress came to apologized for that the promotion is no longer valid. Why didn't the waitress inform before serving? We were not able to change the order to a bottle of wine. After we finished the main courses, we kept looking at the waiters but none of them came to clean the table until my friend went to inform them that we were ready for desserts. One of the waiters even looked away when he noticed that we're looking at him. "
French,L_Angelus,Truly good French restaurant,positive,40,29-Mar-16,"A Singaporean friend assured us this was the best French restaurant in Singapore and after living in France for 30 years I must agree. The foie gras either as pate or pan seared is exceptional, the mains were all good and the molten chocolate cake with ice cream a treat. Particular kudos for the strawberry ice cream dessert. Lovely decor, good service. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, Inattentive Service, Expensive",positive,40,07/21/15,"Had lunch recently & found the food to be good. Nice roast duck with crispy skin and a flavoursome sauce. Decent roast pork with crispy crackling and excellent char siu that was dark and glazed with charred bits that so many look for. Hong Kong style dishes that judging from the dishes we had would get my thumbs up. Nice shrimp dumpling soup & congee. A selection of dim sum available - recommend the black pepper buns which are a nice variation on the familiar ""po lor bau"".The restaurant fills up fast and doesn't take reservations. Go early to snag a table without too much of a wait. However they are forgetful and we were overlooked despite being given a queue number. No apologies but they quickly got us a table when reminded. Servers tend to be inattentive and it's hard to catch their attention; they all seemed too busy. Perhaps the best suggestion is to order take out & save all the hassle. Other people did. Would definitely come back for the food.Essentially for small portions, the bill came to S$100 including an order of custard tarts for dessert."

French,Saveur,Food standards have dropped,negative,30,15-Aug-17,"Used to love this place, not sure what has happened. Food was substandard. Sea Bass was not fresh and beef burgundy was watery and not seasoned well. Pork, Steak and Duck Confit was still good as was the hazelnut dessert but we used to find the food delectable and now it's just passable. Hope it was just an off day."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",1 for 1 promotion using uob card,positive,40,25-Oct-16,"This is my first time to Shin Minori. I was worried that the service would be very slow. To my surprise, the food was served very quickly.
As we are using uob card for 1 for 1 promotion, its super worth it"
French,Angelina_MBS,An Expensive Disappointment!,negative,30,21-Jul-15,"Only had cakes and tea. Did not have the signature hot chocolate as it seemed too sweet since it came pre-sweetened. Tea was a signature blend and has a pleasant orange flavour. Ordered three cakes - an opera, a mango passion cheesecake and the mont blanc. Of the three the Opera was the most successful. The cheesecake was the worst as it seemed to have assimilated some of the flavours of other foods it was stored with in the fridge. I cannot explain but it definitely was not pleasant.I wasn't impressed enough to return to sample the other dishes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cozy,positive,40,17-May-17,"Other than the onigiri, everything else is nice. Would recommend others to come and try at least once for their buffet. The only drawback is that the price doesn't include drinks or dessert. It would be perfect if both of that are included in the menu buffet. The staff were helpful and food came out fast. Perfect place for japanese buffet once in a while."

They served Dosa and Vadasambhar with great taste and three different chatni which ignited our appetite and we ended with much more food than planned.
This is authentic South Indian food at little India...More"
French,L_Angelus,Gone downhill,negative,20,21-Aug-11,I have lived in Singapore for over 10 years and have frequented this place a lot on the basis it was reliable - although never fantastic. We went with some friends and the food and service can only be described as very ordinary. I think this place has had its time and although the rude staff used to be a bit of a novelty........its now got tiresome. I have been there a lot but i would never go again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Signature Singapore Chilli Crab,positive,40,1/9/2014,"This long established seafood restaurant has this outlet in an old colonial style bungalow opposite the Botanic Gardens. There is live seafood displayed in water tanks. All seafood dishes are nice, particularly the famous Chilli Crab--a must try !"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"After all these years, still good.",positive,50,11/16/16,"This is my go-to place for comfort food. Quality consistently good over the past decade. Opens till after 12mn if I'm not wrong. My usual fav are the char Siew pastries, sweet and sour pork and clay pot eggplant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,negative,30,2-Jun-17,food is average and seafood is not very fresh. Staff were friendly though and the general ambiance is cozy.
French,Saveur,Pretty great,positive,40,1-Apr-16,"Service was alright, nothing to complain about. The food was great for the price. Would definitely come back again. :)"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,positive,50,26-Mar-18,"Extremely happy to have dined here. The staff were superb, very attentive and helpful. The chef was just a delight. Happy to chat while he worked. And what a master he was - it is so incredible to watch a true craftsman.But the food - well you will not find fresher or better tasting anywhere. If you are a Japanese food lover then this one is for you. Yes it is expensive, don't think you will get much change out of $1,200 - but you really must try it at least once in your life."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Decent food, poor service",positive,40,9-Oct-17,"Shin Minori provides you with the typical buffet experience- you can get quite a bit of average food for your money, but the service is sub-par. Many of the servers didn't speak English and weren't able to understand our requests. The food came out relatively quickly except for the grill items, and when we were missing a lot of items we ordered, the wait staff told us that all the orders had been fulfilled. We therefore re-ordered the missing items and they showed up twice (beware of this happening as there is a food wastage charge of $10/100g). The food is decent, though you shouldn't be expecting the most high quality sushi from a buffet restaurant. The gyoza was quite good, as well as the fried soft-shell crabs. It was an easy place to go with a large group and share lots of items. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great French food complemented by excellent service,positive,40,5-Jul-15,"We were craving the famous steak frites and were excited to find Les Bouchons. The welcome was efficient, but not overly warm. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations. The food was faultless and the portions were ample, so we were not able to take advantage of the offer of bottomless chips...and the chips are fantastic. Our only slight gripe is that they close after lunch at 2PM. We will definitely be back."
French,Poulet,50 cents for water!,negative,10,10-Sep-13,This place is not cheap and even though our bill was over $50 they have the nerve to charge 50 cents for a glass of warm water. No class whatsoever. We will not be back and people should stop patronizing these small minded places. Is there no management?
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Absolutely Amazing,positive,50,11-Jan-17,This is a gem of an restaurant in Little India. If you are looking for mouth watering south indian food then this is the place to be. The best south indian restaurant in Little India
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy cheap food!,positive,50,17-Jan-17,Best place for a famous hawker market meal in Singapore - its clean and comfortable and the food is of an excellent quality for the standard - you will not be disappointed and will leave full and happy!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overcharging poor service,negative,20,01/17/16,"Used to like this place a lot for the food - would have given 5 stars thenNow, Duck and noodles the only things worth making the trip forService is poor, even worse than HK fast food restaurants - part time staff are better than the full timersToo many things wrong with the service to listTip - dont go for meals In between times just have a plate of duck and noodlesTip 2 - costs less per head if u bring small children as their tables are strictly per head and not by the amount of food you order (they will clear unfinished plates to make room for all the dishes you order if you order 'too many' dishesTip 3 - check the bill, overcharging happened more than onceOtherwise you'd do better at a more upscale dim sum restaurant w/out overcrowding, condescending attitudes and staff chasing you out so that they can pack in the next bunch of familiesOr if you're just into noodles, for similar quality noodles (sadly, no irish ducks) go to Maks at CentrepointAverage bill for 2 - US$70 without beverages"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not value for money,negative,20,11-Aug-11,"We were disappointed with this restaurant as we felt it was way overpriced. The two of us shared a room with two business men which meant it wasn't intimate at all. The chef was timid and seemed to be doing his job without showing any real enthusiasm. With exception of the beef and the dessert courses, we felt the tastes were not as good as the Nadaman Japanese at the Shangri-La where we stayed (or any of the restaurants at the Shangri-La). I don't mind paying a high price for food but when I spend S$900 for 2 people (including 1 bottle + 1 glass of wine + sparkling water), I really expect to come out raving about the food. This is the second time we have tried a ""celebrity chef"" without the chef and we been disappointed so we won't make that mistake again."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",It is just OK,negative,30,24-Jun-16,"I have been over 50 times in last 10 years, standard menu 365 days, very rare that you see juicy tandoor chicken, tastes like you are eating dry meat. Naans are good, methifish is good.. mmm, OK OK lah"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Indian Food,positive,40,9-Apr-16,If you miss indian food in Singapore..do try Kailash Parbat. It serves all indian delicacy and amazing chaat.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent authentic food,positive,40,29-Apr-14,"Food at Newton was great, very fresh, cheap and plenty of it. There is seating in the open and undercover and is great for families with plenty of room for the kids to run around. We would recommend the famous chilli crab from Tay at Takara Grilled Seafood, Stall 74."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,negative,30,5-Jul-17,"Extensive selection available for the buffet lunch. Can try lots of items as single serving is usually one pc. Sashimi are fresh. Overall food are not bad. Do note that the buffet does not include drinks. However, the attitude of the waitresses and waiters, especially one of the waitresses, really need lots of improvement. When I told one waitress that they gave me a bowl of rice which i didn't order, she keeps repeating its ""Gohan"" and insisted that i had ordered it before turning her back and walk away. I need to get their attention again (as i really do not want to eat a bowl of rice!) and this particular waitress walk to my table with her sullen face, upon checking my order list, realized that she had made a mistake, just took the rice away, turn her back and walk off without apologizing. Plain rude!!! In fact they had orders mixed up several time. Most of the time, the waitresses and waiters are standing there talking loudly without any regards to the customers around them."
French,Paul,Pricey food,positive,40,25-Jul-15,"Food has quality and good but the service was lousy. My daughter and I were standing in the Q waiting to get a seat however the staffs walked past me seem do not bother to serve me. I have to walked inside and get someone who can find me a seat. To my surprise, there are few available seats outside the restaurant. The staffs are not friendly and helpful when I have a friend who joined me later. The waitress simply told me there is no empty chair available which is not true. There was no service standard."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good alternative destination to the East Coast,negative,30,12/15/16,I patronize this branch a few times during a calendar year and food and service quality has remained consistent though it does falter when it is especially crowded. Good plus is free parking at Dempsey.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fish for days.,positive,40,18-Mar-17,"one does not go to a japanese buffet for unlimited chawanmushi or yakitori, no, one goes for sashimi. paid $44 for 2 people thanks to the entertainer and had my fill of salmon, swordfish, yellowtail and tuna. slices were thick and fresh. will be back."
French,Saveur,"Consistent food, inexpensive except for desserts",positive,40,9-Feb-18,"Duck confit, chilli crab squid ink pasta and sea bass great as always, but the prawn pasta was alright. Food took a long time to arrive and drinks served very late."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved their pepper crab,positive,40,10/23/14,"Slightly smoky like it was off the BBQ added a delicious layer of flavour. Their special prawns were also excellent, eat the shells and even the heads if you are game! Loved it but beware of the price ++ as this adds plenty to the cost."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi i've ever had! Must go!,positive,50,27-Mar-16,"* Amazing experience and recommend this to anyone* Well worth the money* You'll always compare sushi to this meal* The quality of the ingredients is excellent* The chefs are brilliant, very friendly, welcoming and are happy to talk you through the process* Definitely one of the most memorable meals i've had"
French,L_Angelus,Authentic French style bistro,positive,40,6-Sep-16,"Have been dining here regularly for over 5 years. Nice "" French"" décor and atmosphere. Food and menu has improved recently. The Veal chop is huge, and very tasty. Remains traditionally French, as is the wine list. The wine list is on the expensive side. Closer to fine dining prices in a bistro environment. The restaurant manager is friendly and attentive, particularly to "" regular"" clients."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Totally overrated ...,negative,10,10-Dec-11,"1) Food are pre-cooked and do not come tasting hot and fresh, including the signature fish head curry.

3) More expensive than the average

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Good sushi, but a shocking experience",negative,30,2-Sep-16,"I strongly feel that I have to voice this out to warn potential patrons/customers. As much as I love and adore Shinji based on my 2 previous visits, what I encountered today is just unacceptable. As I had a heavy breakfast, I decided to opt for the 9-piece Hana lunch set menu. The head chef then went on to ask me if I like Uni (sea urchin) and said it's currently the Uni season, so the 12-piece set which includes Uni might be better for me. I replied yes, I do like Uni but today I'm feeling slightly full, so just the 9-piece set will do. Then he said 'Okay, I'll make smaller portions of the rice for you.' Thinking that it's just a kind gesture from the chef, I proceeded with my lunch. Slowly, 8 pieces of sushi were served and to my surprise, I was served Uni for the 9th piece. I knew something wasn't right. In the end, I was served 12 pieces of sushi when I have opted for 9 and yup I was charged $125++ for the 12-piece set lunch.Don't get me wrong, the sushis were brilliant, worthy of the michelin star, but I'm not sure if this behaviour is acceptable. So, the next time you decide to have lunch at Shinji, maybe repeat your order so the Chef gets it right, I don't know."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Best curry so far in Singapore :-) Fantastic...,positive,50,23-Mar-15,"This has been by far the best curry we have eaten in Singapore...
Absolutely fabulous... totally delicious and tasty food and great service... the veggie curry was probably one of the best veggie curries we've ever had...
LOVED IT :-)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible!,negative,10,30-Nov-15,"This was seriously the worst food I have ever had in my life after paying so much! The samosa was nothing to talk about, bathing in oil for I don't know how many hours, I cannot even be sure if it was made the same day! N the paratha was even worse, fully uncooked from the inside.. Forget about cleanliness if u have to visit this place.. I was so damned disappointed.. N its all so expensive, so u obviously expect good quality but that does not seem to be the case! Anyway I would never ever go back to eat here.."
French,L_Angelus,Friday nights ! ,positive,50,19-May-18,"Not very often do you get Value & Authentic French food .. this place is a must try. From the wines to the food, & Desserts to the warm and happy hosts, it’s a place you will go back time and again!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Worth a visit,positive,40,7/1/2016,"This is a very pleasant and bustling restaurant in Chinatown that should certainly be visited at least once, as they accommodated us well. The air conditioned dining area has a casual feel and attentive, if slightly pushy, staff that endeavour to please, even if they do not sometimes understand exactly what you want.We ordered creamy corn soup, wok fried chicken with stir fried local vegetables and scrambled egg and the stir fried fish fillet which were piping hot, good portioned and served without waiting too long."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good sashimi,positive,40,23-May-15,"Went there on thursday night made rsvp 3 days before. Restaurant located on 2nd floor, at first it was a bit hard to find in such a big hotel. The restaurant is very small. All of the seats are in the sushi bar about 20 seats. The chefs were 4 with 3 waitress. We ordered omakase wa. Omakase means we trust the food to the chef. There were 3 choices. One is set menu around SGD 220++ omakase wa is SGD 300++ and the highest omakase is SGD 450++All the fish they serve all import from japan 4 times a week. So they guarantee the freshness and best quality. The chefs are young fun polite and very friendly. They even drink several glass of sake with other customer. They explain each dish they serve including how to make fresh wasabi.With the price and type of dishes we got, I would say it's overpriced. We paid SGD 1260 for 3 omakase and a bottle of sake. However if you are looking for good authentic fresh sashimi, go to Shinji. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,cosy bristro,positive,40,24-May-12,"Was invited there for lunch and the place was cosy with an authentic french atmosphere, the escargot was delicious and the Rib Eye steak was done perfectly to our request, the a bottle of Chateau De Malleret and steak compliment one another."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonably delicious food,negative,30,1-May-16,"Opened on 24 April 2016 after renovation. Been a regular there for many years, prices are not very cheap. Be careful, especially the stall owners and touts like to overcharge foreigners, although that happening now is lesser as stalls face punishment if they tout. Follow the queues. Sporeans are food junkies. They know where is the best food. "
French,Paul,Nice drink; helpful and conscientious staff,positive,50,14-Apr-17,"Went in for coffee with a friend. Managed to forget my credit card behind. By the time I realized this, I called the place and was assured that my card was safe with them. When I went to pick it up, I wanted to offer a little thank-you gift to the person manning the register. But she declined saying that this is what they do for all their customers. Much appreciated, especially because I am flying out of Singapore just a few hours later."
French,Saveur,Valentine's Day Dinner,negative,30,15-Feb-16,"Went to Saveur for its Valentine's Day set meal, we were seated promptly. The place was not too noisy as compared to the branch at Far East.We waited more than 30 mins for the appetizer to be served. I'm not sure if the waitress left us out or was too busy to keep track of our courses. She came to us and asked if our appetizers were served. Shouldn't they take note of customers' orders?Next, I bought a cake and left it under their care to be temporarily stored in their fridge. To my greatest surprise, my cake was served to the guests seated on our left side! I had to highlight to her that the cake belonged to me. She swiftly wanted to serve us the cake while we were still waiting for our main course to arrive and that spoilt the surprise I had for my fiance.Next, we were served ice water that was ordered by the guest seated on the left! Once again, I had to highlight that the order belonged to the next table. Are customers expected to help remember orders for the waitresses?Although I was disappointed in the service, I must say that the food were freshly prepared. I enjoyed the food there but would seriously think twice about returning. Hopefully the management can look into staff training."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wouldn't visit again,positive,50,2-Jun-18,"Came here following a recommendation from a local.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Really nice!,positive,40,28-May-14,"We went there for lunch.. Great staff, nice food, but a bit expensive for international travellers. Since we were twelve of us, it did not seem as expensive as it actually is.."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ms Tan @ No.70,positive,40,26-Jan-15,"We caught the train to Newton and headed straight to Newton Circus for dinner. It wasn't how I remembered it 24 years ago, then it was packed, busy and cheap. Had a stroll around looking at what was on offer and came across stall No.70. We quickly ordered grilled prawn, sweet & sour chicken, stir fried water spinach and Singapore noodles. A cold tiger beer hit the spot on this steamy Singapore night. Our food arrived and the grilled prawn was so big, enough for 1 person, coated in a homemade chilli & garlic sauce, it was so yum. All our food was delicious and just enough to fill us. Ms Tan was lovely, as soon as she said ""yummy yummy in my tummy"" I knew we had chosen well. Look, like alot of others have said, it's not cheap, but it was good."
French,Saveur,Quality without the hefty price tag,positive,50,2-Jul-17,"Decided to do a casual belated birthday lunch with a close friend. Lunch set always a good choice at a reasonable price of $22.90. We chose the Saveurs Pasta to start and it always lived up to its tasty reputation. Had the pork belly for the main and friend had the duck confit. Both wonderful and executed well. Only disappointment was the creme brûlée which one has to top up $2 for instead of the dessert of the day (vanilla ice cream). Well it wasn't the taste or quality that bothered me. Both my friend and I preferred the creme brûlée as our desserts when our orders for appertiser, mains and desserts were taken at 12:30pm. Our nice server came back at 12:32pm to say that they only had one creme brûlée left. No. Seriously? There was hardly a crowd at 12:25pm when we sat down. And the creme brûlée was out??? Oh well. I took the lacklustre chocolate ice cream instead. Minus the creme brûlée fiasco, it was still a very enjoyable meal as always with prompt service!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in a life time experience,positive,50,28-Mar-17,"Not sure what to write, this is a culinary experience on a whole different level! All the dishes are prepared in front of you in a private room, so no distractions from other tables.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food but not suitable for big groups,positive,40,9-Dec-16,"Went there as a group of 24 to celebrate my boy's birthday. Was given a private room but it was very packed to the point of discomfort. Food was great but some of the ala carte buffet orders went mixed up due to ""overwhelming"" order through the iPad system.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Greasy and unhealthy food,negative,30,11-Feb-18,"It is a well known restaurant so when we saw it in Singapore last year, we were really excited.The place is clean with good ambience.We ordered a very light meal but it turned out to be an oily mess.I kind of felt sick after eating it and started throwing up. I had to take medicine and our plans for that day were ruined.We were highly disappointed.We visited singapore last month as well but gave this restaurant a miss. "
French,Angelina_MBS,A mediocre dinner,negative,30,26-Feb-18,"There was no one at the entire restaurant when we had dinner. Food wise, nothing fantastic other than the renowned chocolate drink. I was surprise that the restaurant ran out of salmon when I ordered the Singapore salad. Will recommend the restaurant only when you need a nice chocolate drink or a nice tea. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent Dim Sum in Chinatown,negative,30,1/12/2014,The dim sum here is decent. I live in New York City where there are several good dim sum restaurants. Yum Cha compares to them.I did appreciate the menu separating the steamed dishes from the fried dishes. The restrooms need to be cleaned. Service is fine.

French,Paul,Friendly staff with ???? recommendation @ paragon,positive,40,23-May-18,"Surprisingly friendly staff who attended to our table. I brought my parents for routine medical check up and decided to stop at Paul. It is the first cafe other than Toast Box as we walked back to paragon. My first time at Paul and I asked for recommendations. We had avocado scramble eggs and croque monsier to share. It is . Perfect for the elders as we requested for our food to be less salty. The friendly staff as well,was helpful to fill up my parent’s thermal flask with hot water before we left. Will definitely be back for the next check up."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Underwhelmed By The Food,negative,30,25-Dec-15,"Firstly I'd like to thank the manager Zach for being accommodating and giving us an indoor seat although the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Eve. For the food, it's unfortunate that I was underwhelmed by it. Sirloin steak had too much fats in it, and the frites were limp. My salmon was too oily and I couldn't finish half of it. Our appetiser Os A Moelle (beef bone marrow) was extremely oily and it was a bit too heavy on the palette. Perhaps this is French cooking for you but for me, it wasn't the most pleasant eating experience. 2 mains with 1 appetiser came up to $115. "
French,Paul,Great experience and great service,positive,50,24-Apr-18,"My friends and I came to Paul(takashimaya) for lunch yesterday and we had a great time. Service was great,very friendly and cheerful service crews. Gave us great recommendation on food and even recommended us to awesome deserts according to our preference of taste. Their food is really good,both presentation and taste. Coffee was awesome, love the coffee in Paul. Not to miss out on their hot chocolate. Overall we had great time in Paul. I will definitely go back there. Thank you Paul."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mesmerizing Moment of Magic,positive,50,7-Mar-13,"A birthday meal befitting of a royalty. Before the meal, I was rather skeptical, thinking that Waku Ghin is going to be like all those over-rated celebrities' chef restaurants; form over substance. But Wak Ghin is nothing less than spectacular.We arrived early were seated comfortably in the classy bar area. A sweet fruity white wine was introduced to whet my appetite and I was instantly swooning in delight upon the first sip. It was thus natural to get a whole bottle, which was extremely satisfying and lasted us through the 10 course gastronomic extravaganza~The dinner started off with the friendly wait-staff guiding us to a spacious 4 dinner Teppanyaki room, whereby cheerful chefs greeted us with an impressive array of precious seafood in a wooden box. It was not long before the chef started to perform his magic through transforming these fresh foods into divine dishes that were simply irresistible. We had uni, snapper, lobster, caviar, wagyu, abalone just to name a few. And they are all insanely delectable. The dessert was refreshing and unique, something I would crave for after a while...All in the all, Waku Ghin is a gourmet's dream come true. Since life's selection of tantalizing experiences are far and few, Wak Ghin is certainly one that is not to be missed."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Singaporean Dim Sum,positive,40,1/7/2015,"You get a very comfortable dining experience with the no-frills dim sum spread against a very cozy ambiance, notably the marble tables and classic wooden seats i.e. very typical Singaporean style. I like their har gows and siew mais, which is consistently tasty and good. Their porridge is also worth mentioning cooked to the right texture. As for dessert, make sure you try their banana pancake."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,negative,30,26-Jun-17,"Decent food but not the most memorable japanese buffet in Singapore. The portion sizes for the hot food were huge, which was rather odd given that this is an ala carte buffet. Service was extremely quick and waitresses were generally very helpful."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Rip off,negative,10,8-Oct-14,Don't eat here. Many years ago it was affordable and the food was reasonable but now it's a rip off. Last night we had a small chili crab and a plate of vegetarian noodles together with a bottle of water and a coconut juice and it came to $60 for street food. Especially stay away from the lady at stall 46. there are many other places in Singapore worth spending your money at.

The dishes were really tasty. Also it was my mum's actual birthday and manager Terry actually offered to provide her with ??, what surprised us was how intricately the birthday dish was displayed with handmade flour decorative items and written with really meaningful chinese words.

So I had mixed feelings but I still went over. I went for salty egg sauce crab, some green and noodles Hong Kong way. Wow absolutely fabulous, so delicious. Amazing taste whatever you take. Extraordinary! Plus the setting is great, old colonial house on Dempsey road, under the palms, in the green. Loved it!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Vegetarian Cuisine - pricey,positive,40,7-Sep-13,"Go to Kailash Parbat for an authentic indian street food experience in a restaurant setup. Chaats and paani puris are really nice. But my favourite remains the chole bhatura and gulab jamun. A must try for each visit.Dinner for 2 costs about 30sgd++ Service is prompt. I was impressed that the manager cleaned the table when he noticed his cleaning staff were quite busy. Food was served within 5-10 minutes.The ambience is average. Though yhe interiors are done nicely, it doesn't g8ve a traditional Indian feel. Also, I personally found it a but noisy (enough to drown the background instrumentals that I like so much).Overall, a place for authentic indian street food with good service. But pricey and mildly noisy."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","Good Food , tasty and great value",positive,40,30-Aug-13,"For vegetarians, this is a great place to enjoy a variety of food with burning a hole in your wallet. The food was very fresh and the place was clean.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious black pepper & chilli crabs!,positive,50,4/6/2018,"What a fantastic experience! Loved each and every single item. Absolutely succulent black pepper and chili crabs! It was just perfect! The fried calsmari, garlic prawns and the oh so delicious fried buns were just out of this world. Quick customer service. Price on the higher end which is definitely worth it. Its a clean and chilled out environment. Just one observation- charging for the napkins was a little cheap i thought. But its their place. So didnt care. Definitely going back!"
French,Poulet,Quite a dissapointment,negative,20,23-Oct-13,"I had a quick lunch here. I tried the signature roast chicken and some mashed potato as side. The service and the atomosphere were OK, but the food is not great. The chicken was served with thick cream sauce. The sauce was too thick and I felt bit sick of it after having half of them. The mashed potate was creamy, but again, the taste is too rich. I did not finish the dish.I do not think I will go back there. For the price I paid, I could have something better."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore","Excellent fish head curry, and good service",positive,50,12-May-13,Had lunch here with friends who live locally and wanted us to try the famous fish head curry - it lived up to our expectations!

Chinese,London Fat Duck,The duck is not fantastic,negative,20,09/26/16,"Ordered the duck bun, chee cheong fun, duck noodles, wanton noodles and duck porridge. But the duck meat is not crispy enough and not fragrant enough. The noodles texture is not bad but very very small portion. The porridge is too plain and tasteless. The chee cheong fun is alright. Prob won;t go back. The beijing duck from imperial treasure beats this ."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Tour de Force,positive,50,14-Jun-14,"This is an amazing restaurant with one of the best meals we have ever experienced. To start we did not love the location and the restaurant is quiet. We enjoyed our fellow guests but the seating is not for everyone. However, once the food starts to flow every bite is amazing. The quality and freshness is exceptional and everything is prepared for you in person so there is interaction with the chef. The beef was brilliant and the wine pairings perfect. We liked the change to the scenic windows for drinks and desserts and you get a chance to watch the laser light show. This is a culinary tour de force and though expensive we left feeling it was worth and it and very satiated. A must in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food,positive,50,3/2/2012,"This restaurant has very good dim sum, great menu, and good service, always busy."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible meal outside of Japan,positive,50,18-May-14,Shinji is an impeccable dining experience. The fish is prepared in a traditional fashion and served with a delicate precision. Lovely wooden decor for the interior provided a comfortable setting for the meal. We would definitely recommend the omakase and you will not be disappointed. The highlight was when the chef revealed a box of uni and we watched as he prepared it for us as sushi. This is a restaurant in Singapore that is a must visit.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Kitchen's Standard Marred Front-line Service,negative,20,3/12/2016,"My mum & I just had the dim-sum buffet lunch at Peach Blossoms.The front-line service was praiseworthy. Reservation was smooth. Reception was warm. The waitress (Alicia) was attentive & thoughtful. It is thus regrettable the kitchen's standard detracted the service quality from the front-line team.Right from the start, the speed of food readiness was not exactly expeditious. Especially for a non-crowded restaurant. It was tolerable ... until the last order of main dish was made. It was a simple order of just 1 small portion of noodles. After 10 minutes, Alicia took the initiative to hasten the food. After 20 minutes, I asked for the bill. After the bill was signed, then the 1 portion of ordinary noodles finally appeared. By then, it was more than 23 minutes since the order was made.Perhaps the kitchen team mistook the concept of dim-sum buffet to be that of Slow Food Movement. The original intention was to assess if the place's a potential venue for a birthday celebration at month-end. The kitchen team has made the decision for us."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Highly overated, below average food.",negative,20,8-May-13,"I went to Kailash Parbat for lunch during my visit to Singapore. I ordered a 'Thali'. First the waiter said Thali is only upto 3.00 PM, I reminded him that time is 2.50 PM. He agreed to provide me with Thali.Food quality was average, very oily and spicy. Lassi was very sweet. Customers have no choice of getting plain or salty Lassi. I was provided heavily buttered roti. I was told that's how bread is served in Thali.I think its best avoidable if you do not like oily and heavy indian food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well Known for Tourist,positive,40,10-Feb-15,"Newton Hawker Centre has changed over the years and is now the main local hawker eating place for tourist. The car parking has always been a problem and now coaches arrive even bigger problem. The hawker stalls are really packed and as soon as you step inside their staff are showing you menu's showing you what you can eat showing you to tables near their stalls. You can buy almost any local dish; Chinese, Indian, Malay, and it all has that slight Western edge taste for the tourist. Prices are some what higher than the more local hawker centre's so I'd tend to go to them. Years ago there were a lot of cats around but now couldn't see any which was good. We ordered a selection of local dishes which were plentiful and good, the Tiger beer came in an ice bucket and were the large bottles. As you'd expect service was quick, as there were plenty of people waiting for tables."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,excellent dim sum in a traditional setting,positive,50,10/16/15,"this long time restaurant on the second floor in Chinatown has terrific dim sum with many options and great tasting dim sum.we went around 3 pm (just as the dim sum all you can eat for high tea was starting) but ordered fewer items off the menu. The choices were varied, tasty, not oily and fun!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very authentic,positive,40,21-Mar-18,Really enjoyed some authentic North Indian cuisine. Waiters were rather uninterested but the food was excellent.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Cantonese food,positive,40,10/18/11,"Good food, good service, good selection of food and clean restaurant. I went here on a business lunch. It was a little noisy but still was conducive to conversation and business. I'd go back again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Chilly Crabs!,positive,40,31-May-14,"We went there for chilly crabs and we were so glad we did ! The seafood is pretty pricey, so don't forget to ask how much it cost and confirm the price as some of the hawkers will increase the price to take advantage of the tourists. The table next to us had some locals were very kindly ordered and negotiated the cost for us...we were very thankful for their assistance. Enjoy your chilly crabs with fresh young coconut juice....refreshing! We will go back on our next visit!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very disappointed,negative,20,10/1/2014,If chilli crab is the national dish of Singapore then Long Beach is guilty of unpatriotic acts against the state. At least the crab was super fresh but the dish was quite disappointing. The crab was served covered in a sweetish-chilli-egg sauce which was poorly executed. I think success has ruined this restaurant. I have had much better chilli crab at small hawker stalls and even from my own kitchen. My recommendation is give this restaurant a miss.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Hawker Center I've Visited,positive,40,10-Dec-16,"Overall, I liked this Hawker Center the best of the 3 that I have visited. it's not the biggest, but it is clean, easy to get to (very close to subway stop), and they have a very good variety of food and drinks. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the other hawker centers selling oyster omelettes...but they had them here...and it was delicious."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Food quite good but Standards have obviously dropped,negative,30,1-Jun-18,"This is our 2nd time there. The 1st being some time back before they were awarded the Michelin star. We had a very good impression the first time. With that reference point in mind, and taking into consideration it is now Michelin star restaurant - we walked away this time sadly disappointed. On the whole the food was still quite good. But for S$ 450 per pax and 1 star - we expected better overall dining experience. Let me illustrate point for point below. As background, this was a birthday celebration for my wife. (1) This special event and her dietary restriction have been clearly spelt out to the restaurant by email of which they have acknowledged. Yet upon being seated. We were asked the same questions again ad verbatim per their email. And to cap it, they asked in front of both of us, if this was a special occasion. I wonder does anyone read the correspondences? Anyway, so much for any surprise dinner occasion there. They ensured the element of surprise is gone. (2) The ohmei A5 beef were of best quality. However, they sliced it so thin in the way of sabu sabu style. It is sacrilegious to use such thin slice on the teppan hot plate. That was just poor use of great beef. Teppan hot plate should always use steak cut and NEVER paper thin slice. (3) Abalone - This was soaked in anchovy sauce that was too strong and the sauce overpowered the natural taste of fresh abalone. Another no-no. (4) Dessert - This was the biggest surprise of all. They gave us a small birthday cake with candle. After the blowing of candle etc, they gave us 2 small slices from it. What happened to the rest of the cake - was a mystery. Normally more restaurants would have packed the rest of it for us. But Waku Ghin was really unusual in this aspect. So now we waited for our degustation set dessert. Normally most top restaurants pride themselves of their artistry and creativity of dessert. But Waku strangely does not. In fact, it appears the 2 small slice of cake above was our degustation dessert. Again this is highly irregular. Most top restaurant would have given a complimentary slice of cake followed by the proper dessert set. In addition, maybe even a dessert trolley. So on the whole for the price and the restaurant ranking - the restaurant need to do way better then that. I felt there has been a some fair bit of cutting corners on cost. The grace and classiness were just missing in this place. At the end of the day, we just remembered it as a rather expensive restaurant that does not provide value nor the requisite service.As a digression. The close comparable in style and food would be U-kai tei in Tokyo which is also 1 Michelin star. But this one beats Waku Ghin hands down in quality of service and food. For that, I would always do seconds or thirds, unfortunately I cannot say the same of Waku."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best seafood meals ever!,positive,50,10/29/16,"This was one of the best seafood meals I have ever had in my life. Along with Restaurant Andre (where I ate during my last visit) this is my favorite place to eat in Singapore.We skipped drinks because we had just come from the rooftop bar at MBS and ordered the food straightaway. We ordered one of their signature set menus.The first course was Steamed Live Scottish Royal Razor Clam with Minced Garlic & Vermicelli and it was my joint-favorite dish of the night. It was followed by their signature dish of Pepper Crabs which was really really good and a close second in terms of taste and flavor for me. This was followed by Fried Leek Flower with dried scallop and olives which was average, I didn't really care for the leek flower. This was followed by my joint favorite dish of the night - Deep Fried Flat Rice Noodleswith ‘La La King’. The deep fried noodles gave the dish the perfect crunch and I just couldn't stop eating. Dessert was Rose Jelly Coconut Cream which was decent but didn't come close to the awesome dishes we had eaten earlier."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Highly Recommended - Satay Sedap (Stall # 67),positive,50,5-Sep-14,"Best satays around. At Newton Hawker Centre there a many stalls that offer chicken, beef, and lamb satays, and I've tried most. But Satay Sedap (#67) is the best."

French,L_Angelus,"Delicious desserts, reasonable price",positive,40,30-Jan-12,"When I eat at L’Angelus, it reminds me the Brasserie atmospheres we have in France. The place is lovely and nicely decorated with old French advertisings. The service staffs know about French cuisine, they easily give advices on the menu without pushing orders. They are thoughtful, taking back your empty dishes once you finish.Last time I went there, I had a Lyon Sausage as starter. This is quite exceptional to find such a classical French dish in Singapore and it was delicious. This kind of sausage contains pistachio; it was served with roasted potatoes. For the main, I had a perfectly medium rare cooked lamb with gratin Dauphinois. My Singaporean friend tried to prevent me for eating the lamb: he was scared I have a food poisoning because he thought the meat was undercooked! I have noticed that most people like very well done meat here but a good meat must be tender and tasty, therefore rare. Overcook a meat makes it dry and takes all the flavours off. Some French people even like their meat so rare we can still see blood at the core!! Anyway, the Chef at l’Angelus knows how to cook a good piece of meat, the lamb was perfect!The dessert was maybe my favourite. No one should leave the Angelus without trying the thin apple pie a la Normande served with a cinnamon ice-cream! The chocolate lava cake my friend too was quite common compared to the desert I choose. We spent about $100 to $120 each what is quite correct for the quality of the food served. The prices for the bottle of wine are reasonable as well.To check more restaurants, visit my blog: http://www.frenchrestaurantinsingapore.blogspot.com/"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Highlight of our trip,positive,50,09/18/15,Now this place is amazing. The food was the best we had in Singapore. Yes you have to wait (we waited an hour) but there is a good reason for that and it's worth every second. We ordered while we waited so when we were called to a table the food was fast and ohhh so yummy. We tried a bit of everything and there was not one thing to complain about. If you are in Singapore make sure you take the time to check this little hidden gem out!Thank you London Fat Duck - you are a credit to Singapore
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi outside of Japan,positive,50,13-Mar-16,"After several deliberations with other close contenders in Bangkok, I have concluded Shinji as the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. The decision is based on taste and serving practice by the chef, and Shinji is my winning choice. Value is also pretty reasonable - though price can be perceived on the high side, the quality, ingredients, and amount of courses offered makes it very justified. You finish your meal on a high note - satisfied with such unmatched flavors and undeniable freshness with attentive service, having an overall satisfaction on dollars well spent.Shinji would be the number 1 nominated choice if looking for the highest quality sushi outside Japan."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Total Rip off,negative,10,7-Feb-16,"This place is a total rip off and tourist trap. Food is average at best. Go to other hawker center for better experience such as Maxwell, Tiong Bahru, etc. The locals don't come here."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delectable,positive,40,07/17/12,"This is a seafood restaurant about 10 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road. It specialises in mudcrab, with chili or black pepper. Make a booking and get there before 6.00pm as it is very popular with the locals. It is not a food hall place so please dress respectably. It standards and quality are way above places like Newton Circus which is living off its tired old reputation for seafood. Dont waste your time going there.It has a mainly outdoors setting and you would think you were in a national park as it is so quiet.The seafood was delectable and we concentrated on the chili and black pepper mudcrab dishes.You wont be disappointed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good deal with birthday promotion,positive,40,22-Jan-17,"The food was not bad, sashimi was good. The selection / variety was ok. Definitely value for money!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for Money,negative,30,25-Oct-16,"Came here with more than 30 colleagues from different part of Asia when they were here for a training.

Overall, it was a lively atmosphere and everyone enjoyed themselves."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",An excellent sushi-ya experience,positive,50,22-Jan-16,"Had a lovely meal at Shinji by Kanesaka. My sister had pre-booked the Omakase Shin menu - their premium Omakase menu beforehand and so we did not have to make any choices for our dinner. The pacing of the meal was excellent as we had a little private room to ourselves. We were served a variety of appetisers including the infamous shirako (cod's milt) which was a very interesting eating experience indeed! Our chef for the night was very accommodating with all our requests - for example, when my sister mentioned that she found the wasabi very strong, he made sure that her portion of sushi contained less wasabi. Overall, a very expensive dinner but one which was worth every penny."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent Service Experience ,positive,50,1/8/2017,"I celebrated my birthday and had a very memorable experience with my family.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town!,positive,50,19-May-16,"We have heard and read so much about this place so had high expectation. We were not disappointed.This was by far the best sushi I have had in my life! Every ingredient flown in fresh from Japan, every piece prepared with great care and attention. Not to mention the superb taste!Every single piece was perfection in a mouthful. What more can I say!I would definitely be back!Personally I preferred sushi over the omakase, which my husband had, but that is just personal preference. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Food wasn’t too bad but service definitely in severe need for improvement!,negative,10,19-Aug-18,"Went there on a first visit with a few friends for tea time. When we were there, there was a short queue but we soon got seated. Thereafter, the crowd started to die down and there were soon some empty seats here and there. We decided on what to eat after 5-10mins and waved for a waitress to assist us. And we were immediately shocked by her response! When we said, “hi, can we order?” , she responded with a “cannot, I will get back to you in 5 mins”. What kind of customer service is this???After that we finally placed our order, btw we ordered 1 teatime set (which according to the menu comes with a choice of coffee, tea or chocolate - we went for an ice chocolate) and also another 2 glasses of ice chocolate plus 1 more ice tea. In addition, we also ordered another 2 slices of cakes for sharing. The teatime set came first (without the drink), followed by 2 ice chocolate and the ice tea. The ice chocolate which should come with the teatime set never came. We had to remind the waiter for a few times and it was a chaotic situation. After the ice chocolate came, I took a sip of it and 1 auntie came over (instinct tells me it’s the lady boss, maybe?) asked if I drank it because the set came with a different chocolate drink! I’m like ermmm ya drank it already. And her next response was, oh then you have to pay for this drink because it’s not part of the set! Hello, so now I’m supposed to pay for something because of your own internal mistake? Freaking pissed. This was episode 2. After that, we waited another 10 mins for our cakes and had to again remind the waiter to serve. The place wasn’t even crowded and there were at least 4 waiters. In conclusion, service was very bad and I would not pay a return visit even though the food was acceptable. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaats and Kulfi Falooda!!,negative,30,4-Oct-16,"Great location near Mustafa, an easy stagger to this vegetarian Sindhi joint after an afternoon of fighting the scrum in Mustafa. The service is average however this is ideal for those looking for a refreshing Chai, Snacks and recovery after an energy sapping session at Mustafa next door. The Paani Poori and Paid Chaat hit the spot and the Kulfi Falooda was a hit with the kids. My eldest pronounced it the best Falooda she has ever had!"
French,Poulet,Well roasted delicious chicken,positive,40,29-Aug-13,"A friend brought me to Poulet at Great World City. We'd the signature dish - the roasted poulet and to my delight, it was well marinated and the sauce wasn't too rich. Definitely great price for a decent meal. I would certainly visit it again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive,negative,30,8-Sep-12,The foods there are not so good and expensive. Selfdom go there but also not bad for lunch and dinner. Beer are a must with friend's
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet but read the fine print,positive,40,29-Dec-15,"All you can eat Japanese buffet is a good deal at $35 per person. Of course, come hungry! Portions are smaller than other Japanese places we visit. Also, watch the fine print. .. one order of sushi from the buffet "" looks"" like you will get two pieces but you only get one. Also if you don't eat everything you order, you get charged $10 per 100 grams. Make sure you eyes are not bigger than your stomach! By the way, ask for a table by the window... otherwise, it's very dark."
French,Saveur,Saveur's Review,positive,50,30-Aug-16,"The quality of the food is spot on. If you're looking for a place to have nice food and drinks, saveur's the place you might want to place it on your check list."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ripoff,negative,20,1-May-16,This is a classic ripoff hawker center. You need to challenge the prices if you are a foreigner because they always try to cheat you. I used to live very near and went there many times. Just beware
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab vs Pepper Crab,positive,50,4/6/2015,Even though Singapore is famous for Chilli crab ... the pepper crab at Long Beach was awesome .... I think better than the Chilli Crab. We ordered the Pepper Crab and the prawns with chilli crab sauce. Both great but the enjoyed the spicy pepper crab more. Must do. Open till late. One of the few place in Singapore.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and good,positive,40,14-Mar-17,"Good ambiance, great food, nice service.
We enjoyed a drink before the meal, then we had the usual entrecote with fries, which was just right, then we finished with dessers which were real good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful dining,positive,40,26-Jul-17,The service there was excellent. Not only that the food was fresh and delightful. Definitely do come here if your willing to try a variety of Japanese food.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great service!,positive,50,09/21/16,Thanks Terry and Sook Teng for the wonderful service! Really enjoyed the food and company! I will recommend my family and friends to visit this wonderful restaurant for awesome delicious delicacies!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Dining Experience,positive,40,19-Jun-17,The service standard can be improved; some members of the service crew could have been more warm instead of just going about with their jobs. It is a Japanese restaurant after all.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but pricey...,positive,40,15-Feb-16,"Restaurants galore at Syed Alwi Road but this is a stand out vegetarian option in the crowd. Went there one evening around 5pm, hoping to get some chaat and we got exactly what we wanted. Their samosa chaat and bhel puri were excellent. My wife wanted a chola bhatura and that tasted great too! I was disappointed that basundhi was not available, but got rasamalai instead. It was a bit of a let down as it wasn't sweet enough to me. This is a good vegetarian option for those who want to taste north indian and chaat, but the prices are a bit on the higher side."
French,Paul,Tanglin mall restaurant.,positive,40,7-Jul-14,"Excellent service. Great food. An authentic atmosphere and menu. Particularly impressed with real bread after days of steamed ""toast"". Will look out for their other sites"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good South Indian Vegetarian meals,positive,40,29-Apr-16,"This chain of restaurants , delivers what it promises, never disappointed. Good meals at reasonable prices. Wished it's Airport T2 outlet was still operating"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi galore!,positive,40,15-Feb-17,"Even if you are not going for sashimi, there are also lots of other good stuff like the crab soup. But of course, people go there for sashimi which is good."
French,L_Angelus,A little taste of France,positive,40,10-Nov-15,"Out and about with mates on Club Street, we all fancied a taste of France for dinner. With no booking, we were seated easily. Service is a little stand off-ish. The staff appear to lack confidence, though were very congenial. A little tinkering, and this could make the difference of this restaurant going from good to great. In terms of the food, it was really very good. We shared pate and escargot to start. A table of 5 and only 3 pieces of bread and 9 escargot. A little proactivity here could make a huge difference. At the time of ordering, if we were offered 10 escargot for additional cost, we would have opted in. We had to ask for additional bread, also. Despite this, I could not fault the food itself. Delicious. Steak was a popular choice at our table and each were cooked to medium-rare perfection. Of particular note, the Tartare was terrific. Assembled and prepared at the table, it was pure food theatre. Delightful.A good wine cellar in the house, we were pleased with the wines. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Halal seafood available,positive,40,31-Dec-17,Thumbs up!! Prices are very reasonable. Be prepared to share tables since always crowded. One downside is when having to sit in between very loud boisterous dinner groups.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Eating For Pleasure,positive,40,9/6/2013,The restaurant is situated in the upmarket Holland Village area and serves fresh authentic Chinese food.. The lotus root preparation is delicious and presentation is excellent. Its a dish we never fail to order.The Hor Fun is also tempting and the crispy pork is a great accompaniment. The sea coconut dessert is a sweet finale. There's a chain of Crystal Jade restaurants in Singapore and we make it a point to visit at least one of them when we are in the country.
French,L_Angelus,"Charming, Cozy and Welcoming",positive,50,29-Aug-14,"The first time I went here was when my friends arranged my birthday dinner here, it was kind of a surprise, and a very pleasant one. From then ive been here quite often, and it’s a perfect place if your would just want to relax, enjoy your meal have a nice conversation. If your alone, just hop on the bar stool, and the staff is kind enough to give you company, also introduce you to regulars around. The ambiance at L'Angelus is perfect for a large group to talk without having to scream over the table and its even better for a quite romantic dinner for two. The food is delicious, I love their desserts…. (There have been time Ive stopped by just for it)The staff is kind and friendly and they make you feel comfortable, from helping you with suggestions, to short conversations while you’re waiting. I'm definitely coming back more often :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good crab but duck was not good,positive,40,04/29/17,"We ordered the black pepper crab, it was a bit spicy but it taste good. The duck was very dry and it looks like left over food from yesterday. Taste awful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great introduction - tourist-friendly enough but also authentic - a good mix,positive,50,2-Sep-16,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. A great mix of options and a good intro to Hawker Centres. It's clean enough without being too sanitised - bustling and (important bit) the food options are good. Also, drinks are a lot cheaper than in hotels so have a few beers while you're there. Note: Hawker Centres are not great for vegetarians at all - very few dishes that are all vegetable even, and I suspect even those ones may be cooked using some seafood-based sauces and / or in pans that are also used for meat/poultry/seafood."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Heaven for Veggies,positive,40,10-Jun-18,"If you are a vegetarian and wish to have Indian food, you can visit this place not only to satisfy your hunger but also to enjoy the food. A bit expensive but if you can find tasty Indian delicacies at Singapore, it's worth."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great Indian meal,positive,40,12-Jun-17,I had a nice dinner with a large team. Food was great ! Diverse colleagues coming from India enjoyed the food. We particularly enjoyed the fish head curry that was exceptional !
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase Master Chefs,positive,50,22-Jul-16,"I've been to Shinji at Raffles 3 times as well as St.Regis twice ! Everytime food is consistently high quality , freshly prepared & served at counter by Master Chefs. Service staff is friendly & efficient to keep customers well attanded during courses. Would visit agin & always recommend to friends & associates !"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is okay, service quite slow, place is spacious",negative,30,24-Sep-18,"Menu to order was a little confusing at first. Each order you send is literally ""one piece"" - so make sure to order in larger quantities. (All the ""one piece"" orders came much later than the ""larger quantities"" orders.)Sashimi is usually served faster than the yakimono. Sashimi had thick cuts; pretty acceptable. Sushi had lots of rice (not my personal preference). Chawanmushi in different flavours was slightly disappointing - it was the default chawanmushi with sauce/topping on top.Atmosphere was still decent. Place could cater to big groups (I had a table for 8). Overall, still an okay place that is value for money, especially since it's ala carte buffet."
French,L_Angelus,Fine French Food in the tropics,positive,40,11-Apr-14,"This restaurant was an unexpected treat, an authentic feeling French restaurant in the heart of Singapore. We dined mid-week and were shown to a table straight away without having made a reservation.The menu was traditional and covered a lot of ground, with plenty of options in both the starters and main courses.We both ordered duck, a confit and roasted breast, which in both cases was beautifully prepared. The food was fabulous but remember to order a side dish if you want vegetables. The cheese course was a stand out, beautifully ripe and served at the right temperature with plenty of bread. For us the main and cheese plate was more than satisfying, although the desserts sounded wonderful too.The prices are high but this is Singapore so to be expected and you do get a good meal and service.We were even treated to an extra glass of wine at the end of our meal by the delightful French manager.One gripe, and it is a general one rather than specific to this restaurant: why can't the prices on the menu include the taxes and charges? We have to pay them anyway and having the total cost would be more honest."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good! ,positive,40,12-Nov-16,"The restaurant looked very chic, so we were afraid we had to pay much, but it was not. We asked for bread (we are too Dutch xD). We got what you can see on the picture and it tasted good!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistently Mind-Blowing,positive,50,5-Feb-14,"Traveled to Singapore again, and naturally, I had to drop by one of my favorite restaurants here!I had dinner there on the 27th of January 2014 (for my wedding anniversary) and again, earlier this evening, to celebrate my best friend's belated birthday.1. Quality of the foodSublime - the ingredients used are so fresh!!!Any fresher, and my slices of chutoro would have marched right off the plate. I half expected the pieces of uni on my little dish to break out into song. Dishes are evidently meticulously conceived and well thought out - I love how they combine flavours. Pretty much the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore, imho, and it's really difficult eating anywhere else because the sashimi/sushi at all other restaurants just pale in comparison.2. Quality of the serviceImpeccable, as always.When you make a reservation, Shinji always makes it a point to contact you a few days before to confirm the reservation, and again on the day itself. They are quick to follow-up with you, and consistently extremely reliable. Lois, especially (the manager) is extremely professional, warm and very, very sweet. Erica, also, always makes me feel very much at home. The chefs really know their stuff - and are very passionate and dedicated. When one is at Shinji, one is truly in good hands: You will be able to experience true Japanese hospitality -- excellent service, Oshino-san/Yoshi-san's gentle, self-deprecating humor mixed with warmth & professionalism."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A meal to remember,positive,50,26-Aug-13,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I went for lunch with a friend and we opt for my omakase meal. My excitement begins just right after I step into the dining area. This is my first purist style omakase meal, only fish and seafood. From the first meal served to us it was an edamame puree with ikura, I know that this lunch will be a memorable one.The fish is fresh and melt in my mouth, the Uni so sweet I can’t stop think about it till the next day. The sushi is so good, the rice is warm and kept at body temperature, and lastly and keep me impressed is the wasabi, so smooth and it’s the first time I taste wasabi as good as it gets. I’m fortunate enough that the master chef Koichiro Oshino is at our service. He made my experience there is well rewarding. The interaction with Chef Oshino is a real bonus lot of interaction and joking.I will recommend this sushi establishment for anyone who appreciate a quality sushi. It was fantastic. We had a really good time there, and definitely will go back there when we’re in town."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,50,9-Jul-15,This is a small restaurant of the famous Kailash Parbat chain located in Little India. Staff is very courteous and polite. Most of them are Indian and speak Hindi. Food is great and for a moment you feel as if you are eating in India only. Must visit if you want good indian food. They also serve Jain Food.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Food,positive,50,4-Apr-16,Kailash Parbat is part of the Indian restaurant chain from Mumbai. The restaurant offers some of the best Indian street side food in addition to some of the best North and South Indian dishes. Located in the heart of Little India it is one the favorite for all tourists visiting Singapore and looking for Indian food. This is a must visit place for all food lovers.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","A place for mediocre hokkien mee, satay, oyster omelette and overpriced seafood",negative,30,14-Dec-08,"A place for mediocre hokkien mee, satay, oyster omelette and overpriced seafood"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Great food with excellent location ,positive,40,24-Jun-15,If you are a foodie and just love south indian food this is the place to be..While the name sounds a little funny but mind u taste makes it an apt place to visit..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great chilli crab at newton,positive,40,27-Jun-16,"I was recommended this venue by a friend who lived here for 10 years, as an alternative to the east coast seafood market, as it was raining when I visited. This indeed is a really cool place for chilli or pepper crab, and an array of other Asian foods.A big tip to remember here is to ask the stall seller to weigh your food first before ordering, as prices vary greatly.Worth a visit, and easy access by taxi and MRT."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best inTown,positive,50,30-Nov-14,yes it is not cheap but it's a gastronomic experience and worth every dollar spent. The whole experience is great with all the chefs super talented and trained to deserve being on the line. Fish is air flown fresh and each one has a special sauce and sequence to be eaten. Lunch prices are cheaper tha dinners and your guests will sure have a memorable experience. To me its the best in town and have been there many times and never dissapointed !
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Vday Dinner 2016,positive,50,15-Feb-16,"bought 3x Yu Sheng Promo from Shin Minori and their service left me a good impression and thought would take an opportunity to have a meal there.Since its Vday and my buddy is in town, I booked for a table for 4. As there were a crowd, we waited appox 5 mins for a table which is pretty expected. Welcome with a smile by the lady boss and after by service staff Gary. I guess my previous purchases have made it easier for me to reach out to them.The food was served without much delay and hot. The only issue I have was with the tablet, which was a little slow. The salmon sashimi were fresh and thick slices. I love the soft shell crabs. The dessert served that night was unique and delicious. At payment, we are handled a gift which is Jap Table Lamp. Place alittle busy that very evening and so I would also not penalise the lack of attention given. For the amount I paid for 3 adults and 1 child, I must said that we made it worthwhile. Would go back for dinner someday."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad level of dining experience,negative,10,22-Feb-17,Beware that you need to print out the Chope voucher before you dine as there is zero empathy from the restaurant manager if you don't have the hard copy. We request if we could change seats but was turned down and lastly when we asked if drinks was included in the buffet we were told clearly that only water and green tea was free despite that they will actually charged you for it. When I asked about the charges all I received was a cunning smile that the drinks are not free but FREE FLOW.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Chinese fine dinning,positive,40,12/4/2016,"We had dinner at Peach Blossoms on a weekday evening. It wasn't busy. We got a table of three, a good view of the Marina Sands, but the table was a bit wobbly. It's a Chinese fine dinning restaurant with beautiful decor. All the dishes we had was very tasty and beautifully presented. The staff was very friendly and service was good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for drinks and supper,positive,50,6-Jun-17,"Stall 29 offered nice cold drinks and super chilled beers. Linda never fails to make you feel welcomed and homely. Great fresh seafood offered at other stalls, when the time of your visit is right."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good Curry Restaurant at Dempsey Hill,negative,30,15-Sep-16,A good place to try Rice and Curry if you are in the Dempsey Hill area.The Mutton Poriyal and Fish Head Curry is superb
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lively and good food,positive,40,23-Sep-16,"If you like your food al fresco with about a thousand others, both locals and tourists, this is your go to place. Newton has become our first checkpoint whenever we travel to Singapore.Endorsed by the Singaporean Tourism promotion board you get a first profile of local cuisine at 83 food stalls. Not all of them are different though. Among locals Newton has gained notoriety as some stalls were overcharging for their seafood. So better check prices and make sure you don't receive something you did not order. We however did not encounter any problems. Stall owners were friendly, food arrived fast and we got what we ordered. We enjoyed yummy fish ball kway tiao, excellent chicken wings and tasty kalian. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Real Atmosphere,positive,50,23-Oct-14,"We love Newton Circus, and ate here 3 nights out of a 5 night stay. The satay sticks and chicken wings from stall number 30 are delicious. Add a nice cold beer or juice from Michaels at number 29 a beautiful balmy night and what more could you want?? This is to me what a hawker centre should be and I love the atmosphere and vibe. This is something we just cannot get back home. I think the prices are reasonable. The only down side is some of the more aggressive touts, but just tell them politely to go away and that you will get your own table. Then you can freely look at all of the stalls. There is a good variety of food available. Can't wait to return."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"""Yummy Yummy Chilli Crab""",positive,50,8/7/2016,"Had dinner with friends and family last night. We enjoyed the Chilli Crab most with the Mantou or Chinese fried buns compared to the Black Pepper . Cereal Live prawn was so-so. A different taste from your usual ""Zhi Char"" stall. You have an option to have this dish with or without the shell of the prawns. We tried the one without prawn shell as we were lazy to peel them. The deep fried baby squid was yummy . My all time favourite dish when dinning at Long Beach Dempsey. Worth trying the Beancurd dish with Chef special sauce . Many thanks especially to Assistant Manager William and his team Man Yanyan who always takes good care of my family and friends . Service was excellent even though the restaurant was running full house yesterday . Remember to book table in advance to avoid disappointment especially the weekends. Private rooms are available from min spending of S$600 onwards .. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Super Good Crispy Bun with black pepper duck,positive,40,09/22/15,"For enthusiats inChinese Dimsum this restaurant is a must when visiting Singapore. The spiciness and crispy texture of the bun really had me begging for more. I tried Siew Long Pao too and it turned out to be quite good for me. Served hot and not so overpriced making dim sum here a lovely experience in my trip this time. I went during late afternoon hours which made me getting no long queuing experience, so I would recommend the time for your visit to avoid the crowd."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent meal--ate too much!,positive,40,04/24/16,"I visited this restaurant with a group of colleagues as a special occasion. We had an excellent meal, with various dishes, including their signature Chili Crab. Each dish was well prepared and well presented. In the end, we had more food that we really needed, with the result that most of us ate too much. The ice cream and red bean sauce that came at the end of the meal actually helped overcome the feeling of ""fullness"". The only potential damper on the evening was the fact that the restaurant refused to call cabs for us when we were ready to leave."
French,Saveur,Yummy food at affordable prices,positive,40,5-Dec-17,"I dined here with my friends on a saturday night and it was pretty packed, resulting in a relatively slow service. Our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive. - The salmon confit came in a awfully small portion but I guess you're paying for its quality! The texture of the salmon was amazingly soft and tender, melting in my mouth with every precious bite I took. The lemon vinaigrette that came with it had a sweet and sour taste, which paired really well with the salmon! The only downside was that the portion was way too meagre - perhaps they could make this a main dish instead of an appetiser, upsizing the salmon and adding a side to compliment it. - The duck confit, considering that it was a signature item on their menu, was perfectly executed. The duck meat was fork-tender and delicate, with the right amount of juiciness. It is served on a fluffy bed of mashed potato purée, sautéed mushrooms and orange segments. - The pork belly was served atop a substantial amount of ""Gabure"" french stew, with coco beans, mixed frozen vegetables, sous vide egg, and drenched in honey mustard sauce. The meat wasn't particularly memorable; it could do better with crispier skin. The french stew was average-tasting as well, and it got quite 'jelat' towards the end. - Truffle fries were served hot and crispy, but there was no distinct taste of truffle at all. The parmesan cheese shavings added a nice touch to the fries, but there was no dip to enjoy my fries with. I personally felt that this dish was rather disappointing. All in all, the food served here at Saveur is certainly above average and value for money, considering their affordable prices. If you wish to satisfy your french cuisine craving without burning a hole in your pocket, this might be a place you wanna consider dining at! :-) "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner Buffet,positive,40,20-Jan-18,"The food quality has improved compared to last time I dine here. The service is good too. They clear your plates regulary. However, the lights in the restaurant is quite dim. I don't like to dine in so dark ambience but because of the food, I will come back again."
French,L_Angelus,Great food that is almost worth the wait,negative,30,5-Nov-16,"L'Angelus rightly has a great reputation for its excellent French food and is located in the lively Club Street. But our evening was undermined by snail-paced service. We started with the incredible mushroom soup, the fois gras and terrine, all served in a reasonable time. Then we had to wait well over an hour for our main courses. When they arrived, they were excellent: duck, beef and lamb. We complained about the wait and management assured us that this was unusual and because they were short-staffed, and offered us a complimentary drink. One of our party said that they had experienced something similar before, so I would definitely recommend the food but only if you have superhuman patience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great dining experience,positive,50,13-May-13,The ambience was fairly light hearted. All the dishes were great and with just enough theatrical execution without bring intimidating or too mysterious.With my pathetic japanese we still kept enough banter between the excellent sushi chef and had a great time.The freshness and quantity of uni more than justify for the price tag.The sushi were all very well balanced between the rice quantity. The vinegered rice was well moulded and have enough flavour on its own and complemented the raw fish beautifully.In fact we enjoyed the meal so much we had 3 bottles of sake between us and the sushi chef.It is not the cheapest place to dine but its well worth it as its as good as a 3 star michelin kaiseki in Kyoto.
French,Saveur,Must try!! Affordable French cuisine,positive,40,6-Nov-16,"The dishes are delicious; and they are nicely presented on the plates; Price wise they are affordable; French food.
However, they serve the main dishes just we starting to eat our starters. And that's bad timing."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Mediocre food and service,negative,30,8-Jul-12,Food is not freshly prepared but served from a kind of buffet. Didn't taste very well. Food served on re-sued banana leaves that feel greasy. Service was slow and uninterested. There are many better and cheaper Indian restaurants in town.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply amazing,positive,50,4-Nov-15,Tried the new Shinji at the St Regis last month. Was so impressed by it and was dying to try the original at Raffles hotel. Got to say they are both stunning. Without doubt the best sushi in town. The counter service is very personal as well with the chefs keen to entertain and engage. It is pricey but it is the place to impress clients and special ones.

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Rapid family dinner,positive,40,2-May-18,Nice place to be if you want a quick eat-out. the service is rapid and the food is really good...A little bit expensive but you have generous servings of sambal and chutneys. the food proposed is also different from what you usually get on the...More

French,Paul,Bad service,negative,10,28-Feb-15,Very bad service. Staff was rude and were inflexible in accommodating requests. Went at 2115. Half the tables inside was empty. But staff was unwilling to let us sit inside. It was a good hour before last orders. Very bad experience.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible Japanese banquet,positive,50,15-May-14,"Shinji is a cosy and intimate Japanese on the second floor of Raffles Hotel, with a traditional warm, soft wood interior. It has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite, helpful and impeccably efficient.We ate a ten course menu of gourmet seafood delights. The presentation was flawless and the variety exquisite. There were whole, deep fried hardshell baby crabs about the size of British fifty pence pieces - very crunchy - delicate sea urchin eggs, sushi and sashimi, accompanied by delicious sake. It was a lovely meal and the dessert selection of sticky, sweet moji, sesami and green tea ice cream, and a slice of melon provided a perfect close. By all accounts Shinji is the finest Japanese dining in Singapore. I wasn't paying, fortunately, as I understand that the prices are not for the faint hearted or weak of pocket. My friend blanched when the bill was presented, so I could tell it was not insubstantial. But as several reviewers have commented, sumptuous food and experienced Japanese chefs come at a premium. As long as you visit prepared for a fine meal and a large bill, you will not be disappointed.The owner, Mr Ong, and his wife were there, and made us feel very welcome. The restaurant is a credit to them."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good South Indian Non Veg,positive,40,15-Sep-13,Good vegetarian hotel of South Indian kind. Good place for a fast bite. The quality of the food seemed to have dropped over the years. Am I the only one who feels so.

Perhaps it's the fact that its in Mbs. But it's not bad, it's more for the atmosphere than the food I would say"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good India Vegetarian Food,positive,40,10-Jan-18,Very good selection of menu and the food is really good. Its definitely a dependable place to go for lunch or dinner especially after a long tiring day. Definitely its very pricey but the service is really good.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Questionable Hygiene Standard.,negative,10,05/24/17,"I was at Yum Cha, Chinatown SG, for lunch with my spouse on 23 May 2017. After placing our dim sum order, I proceeded to the washroom at about 12:45 pm to wash my hands as habitual before my meal.In the washroom, I noticed a Yum Cha staff coming out a toilet cubicle and just rinsed his fingers tip quickly at the wash basin next to me. He did not bother to use soap and to wash his hands thoroughly. There was a poster on the wall next to the basins with pics and instructions, apparently for staff, how to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and wash after using the toilet. When he saw me looking at him with disbelief, all he did was smiled and walked out.I am not sure if he handles food there. But with that attitude in my presence as the customer, I wondered what he would do if he was alone with no one watching.Needless to say, I did not enjoy my lunch after that.I always thought Yum Cha served quite good dim sum. Now I have great doubts about the standard of staff discipline and hygiene. Yum Cha?, never again!"
French,Paul,Mediocre food and service,negative,20,2-Aug-13,"The cafe au liat has no coffee taste - i compare it to the 2 other cafes in the same building - this is of poor quality. The blueberry tart was ok - nothing fantastic. While i was there some other customer, who were there before me, got irritated at not receiving one order of food, which seemed to be just an order of toast. My order was served earlier than theirs. Since there are 2 other cafes there, i would not step into this one again"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian cuisine,negative,30,13-Aug-16,Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa has a good ambience and the service is good. The place gets busy on weekdays after 12 pm. Lot of families drop in with kids. Thete is a good selection of North Indian cuisine. They offer a diverse range of Sindhi dishes and chaat. The restaurant was clean and the air conditioning was doing a good job on a hot and humid day.I tried their Chana Bhatura with sweet lassi. The meal cost SGD 18 bucks with taxes. The chana bhatura consists of 2 non oily medium sized bhaturas. The chana was average as I was expecting the chana to have more interesting flavours and aroma. The sweet lassi was very good and not diluted with water that is commonplace at most joints in the Little India area. Those on a tight budget or looking for value for money are probably better off exploring other joints.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","When in doubt, head to Murugan",positive,50,7-Nov-12,"Authentic south indian food, which tastes almost close to home cooked food. The varieties of chutneys, the sambhar, the dosas are all just awesome."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good morning with Dim sum ,positive,40,08/24/15,"We visit Yum cha reataurant at Chinatown, It's on second floor, a big place with many tables.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoy $50 Rubber Steaks Here!!!!,negative,10,23-Jul-18,"Absolutely terrible food. One of the worst meals I have had in DECADES. Steaks taste boiled. For those who truly know steak...Outback Steakhouse would be a DRASTIC improvement over this place-whats that tell you?. Food came out drenched in a gray sauce all smashed together with fries and a piece of steak that looked deathly underneath. After trying the food, we walked out laughing at what a poor attempt that was at being a restaurant and left to go to a legitimate steakhouse."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you can't go to Hong Kong or Tokyo ...,positive,40,1-Jul-12,"Shinji is certainly the best sushi in Singapore, easily surpasses Aoki. Is it worth it? That depends, if you really want very good sushi, and are stuck in Singapore, then paying SGD 500 per person (including sake) is the only thing to do. What is unfortunate is that it does really measure up on a regional scale. Of course, it is more expensive and no where as good as the places in Japan. But, what about Hong Kong? I frequently dine at Sushi Shin in Hong Kong and find it to be slightly less expensive, and far better than Shinji. Recently, I was in Tokyo (ate at Kyubei), Hong Kong (ate at Sushi Shin) and Singapore (ate at Shinji) all within a month. Over such a short period, it was easy for me to compare, and while Shinji was the most expensive of the three, it was also the worst."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Nice food, service so-so",positive,40,6/6/2017,"We were browsing and wanted to try this place as i wanted to try their roast items. Ordered the three combination, noodles and also some dim sum to try. The combination turn out very well especially the char siew as it had a mix of lean + fat meat on every piece(which is the way i liked my char siew). The black pepper duck bun was also tasty though the downside is that there is little filling (pic attached). The signature steam cheong fun was also good and inside the fritter, there was some prawn/fish paste which gave that food a different texture and taste. They kept the sauce and cheong fun separate instead of pouring the sauce on the cheongfun. Service is somewhat lacking and the staff mixed up our table orders with another's even though it was not full. The place is also pretty simple and felt similar to a crystal jade. Overall, i would probably want to try some of the other dishes to see if this could become a regular hangout."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best north Indian Vegetarian food,positive,40,17-May-17,This place in Little india is worth going for Lunch or Dinner. You may have to wait for 15-30 minutes at peak time but the quality of food is much better than most restaurants in Delhi. They also serve nice Jain meals. Their chaat is awesome.

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck was not the star!,negative,30,11/28/15,"Visited the London Fat Duck today. We had the Roast Duck, crispy Pork Belly, Char Siew Bao crispy buns and Cheong Fun. With Chinese tea and Barley the total bill was just over $50. The star dish was the pork belly. The duck was so-so with a lot of bone and not too much meat. I would not go back for the duck but the other dishes were good. Service was quick and efficient. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Reputation ,positive,50,6-Sep-18,I am an avid fan of KP and its Pani Puri in Mumbai and as usual it has its own reputation of serving delicious food and it did not disappoint me either.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A great choice in Singapore,positive,50,27-Feb-14,"We went there with my husband 2 days ago and had a great experience. The food is high quality, the service is fautless, and the whole diner was really tasty.Of course this is an expensive restaurant and for a french person like me the air conditionner is way too high ( I will suggest people who are not used to air conditionner to bring a jacket or you'll be freezing). But the overall experience was really great. The beef was so tasty and tender, the abalon was great too and we were not deceived ( as it is often the case after a good meal) by the desserts that were a perfect ending to this great evening.The sommelier is french, and gave us good advice for the choice of the Sake ( they have such a great choice of Sake in this restaurant).We really enjoyed our diner at Waku Ghun and for sure we will come back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chilli Crab!,positive,50,04/14/13,The restaurant was very busy but the staff were helpful and efficient.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent,positive,50,8-Jan-15,"4 of us had a 3 course meal for less than 60 SGD. The location is great, right Opposite Mustafa Centre. There are also number of Indian restaurants around there are only a few that are 100% Vegetarian.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili and Black Pepper Crab,positive,40,06/30/14,"This is actually the second choice by my sis when we visited her. Jambo is her first choice but it's fully book, all the branches!Ordered Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roast Chicken, Beancurb and lala noodles. Crab is big (1kg or so). Very good. Roast chicken is good too! In general, good food.Remember to order dumpling to soak up the chili crab'a sauces!Service wise is good as well. Reservation is a must as this is also popular place."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Western setting for Indian cuisine,positive,40,13-Jun-16,"It would made life easier if they had English descriptions under their dishes' names.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Spicy, in the heart of Singapore; If that's what you are looking for, this is the place",positive,40,10/28/12,"This place is an Esau one to access without suffering the heavy traffic jams towards the East Coast, and food is as good. And food can be very spicy too, for those who love chilli crab and pepper crab and the likes, this place does meet expectations. The area at Dempsey hill makes it a pleasant venue to have dinner and move afterwards to another place for a drink and perhaps a bit of live music.The sits outside on the balcony are pleasant, no air con however served by fans. It is perhaps a better location than inside, as you feel the age of the place much more."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Mostly consistent food quality, haughty Manager",negative,30,6/2/2016,"For authentic tasting dim sum but served in relatively larger portions, Yum Cha is the place to go. However, our favourite egg tart has suffered a huge drop in standard. It's been served cold and lacks the usual soft fluffy texture and aroma. Otherwise, other usual suspects like siew mai (steamed pork dumplings), har kao (prawn dumpling) and rice dumplings still taste good. Service, however can be improved. Serving crew was obviously overwhelmed but they tried their best to be hospitable. The same cannot be said of the young male manager, however. He was haughty and waved customers away to ask them to wait when he was busy. As a local, guess I am used to this but this may not be entirely pleasant for a tourist curious about local delicacies and can do with some patient serving staff who can explain the wonderful flavours that Yum Cha can offer. In short, go purely for its food and expect nothing from their service. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet @ UE Square,positive,40,24-Jan-18,"Ambience is good, Food is with good quality!Love their yakitori and the sashimi is really fresh!Personally find that if their buffet includes drinks and dessert will be a plus!The only thing I do not like about the restaurant is that their seating is not very spacious.This is my 3rd visit, so if it is not good, i will not visit repeated isn't it?Overall, I definitely do recommend Shin Minori @ UE Square!"

I had the fish meal which was delicious and the raspberry and creme éclair for dessert. Yum. Main was $27.00 so two courses around $50. My only feedback was that they were so busy that service was lacking and we had to constantly call staff over. The staff were friendly though. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","A ""must do"" in Singapore",positive,50,15-Jul-14,"Make sure you arrive early to bag a seat at this fabulous food market. Great fun to watch the locals collecting their takeaways for dinner! Each cabin prepares their own speciality and you just choose whatever takes your fancy.

French,L_Angelus,Double check your bill!,negative,20,15-Mar-14,I used to love this place. Until this time when I checked my bill and realized they completely overcharged us for the wrong bottle and the wrong number of bottles of wine. The service was already appalling to start with and then when we pointed out the mistake we were treated even more rudely! Make sure you check your bills!!!!! They tried to overcharge us by sgd 100s of dollars!!
French,Saveur,Delicious food and good service.,positive,50,24-Jun-18,We have been to Saveur many times and have enjoyed every meal. Our particular favorite dishes are the Duck confit and the various truffled foods. Easy restaurant to enjoy a nice meal.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","The high price of food here is only in the good looks of the food, not the taste of the food.",negative,30,5-Jun-12,"A place which deserves a miss. Just because the food is nicely decorated on your plate for you, don't make the taste nice or expensive. These guys here are literally slaughtering their customers in Singapore dollars and having the last laugh at their customers. Every Singapore dollar is now 45 rupees and to be paying s$30 for 2 plates of pain puri and a glass of lime drink equates to 1350 Indian rupees. So keep laughing guys! It's matter of time before we laugh at you."
French,Paul,"Great for breakfast and coffee, but...",negative,30,19-Oct-16,"Had tried Paul before for coffee and breakfasts before, and certainly their croissants are excellent (if you get them early in the morning when they are freshly-baked), but a recent visit for lunch was somewhat disappointing. If I remember correctly they used to have a pretty good lunch set in the past. But that is gone now. The food is still okay but it's quite pricey for what it is. Though if you want a quick place to grab a decent lunch - even a causal business one - its still okay. "

French,Paul,"PAUL, Maison De Qualité 1889 [Singapore]",positive,40,27-Apr-12,"For full story, please go to www.epinosh.comMy story with PAUL café has began. It was a delayed encounter with the renowned boulangerie from the Northern France. Since its inception in 1889, it has franchised more than 400 bakery café world-widely and Singapore seems to be the latest venture in Asia.Speaking of the crowds at PAUL, I was terrified. I have heard of people making a beeline at the café entrance and that the restaurant waiting service has been poor, kitchen almost went into retardation, food quality didn't match up and the negative response goes on. That was probably 3 months ago when it first welcome its diners in Singapore. I am not totally surprised by the teething issues they faced,  given the outlet is the first in Singapore. For dinner, I ordered Croque Saumon Poireaux. The roast salmon and leeks married well! Embedded between those cheesy toasted bread, they are so moist and delicious! The whole dish was not overly bready.Another came along; Crepe Complete. It is turkey & cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. Interestingly, the oozing cheese fills up your oral cavity while its aroma chalked up your nasal concha!I decided on Hot Vanilla Milk to interact with my food. I have to admit my ignorance.. I have thought that ""milk is an unsweetened drink"" and it turned out to be sugared? Levelling up my knowledge, I owed it to PAUL. The vanilla milk was a real classic; nicely infused and not artificial.    "

All I asked was to replace s coffee! My husband at this point said change the coffee or refund it.I was served a NEW cup, which tasted like mixture of DISH WATER and dregs of cigarettes mixed in.It was Thick and gloopy.I was shocked to see such bad attitude for such a minor problem, I payed even for the dish waster they served up.I am never going there again."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Was much better 3-4 years ago,positive,40,13-May-12,"Brought my family of six there for dinner during mother's day. My wife and I have been patronizing this place once every 3-6 months for the past 4 years. They still serve their bread and frites free flow till this day.The steak is inconsistent, there're days when it's great, and there're days where it doesnt taste as good. The ribeye is fairly consistent and great, while the frites were sometimes just nice, or too burnt. Probably the most disappointing was when they started cutting costs and using 'peh-cai', chinese cabbage to substitute in their complimentary salad. Discerning customers like myself do notice such things. But all in all, still pretty decent value for money if you need a good steak with lots of carbs."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant meal and experience!,positive,50,24-Jan-15,"Well worth the accolade of 7th best resturant in Asia (San Pellegrino) the preparation, ingredients and quality of cooking is top notch. A very different experience to Tetsuyas in Sydney, but that's what's great about it, it's not a Nobu style cut and paste job. Very well thought out. High attention to detail. Don't miss a cocktail at the bar before your meal!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One of the best,positive,40,28-Jun-17,"If there's any place I religiously frequent for fresh sashimi it's Shin Minori. I have been visiting this eatery for over 2 years, and it's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants that stick to their standards. Never once had I eaten a badly prepared dish. I have taken a counter seat before and seen the chefs work their crafts. Very dedicated individuals. But like every other no one place is perfect. I think their customer service (from the waiters / waitresses) leaves much to be desired, often not getting the correct orders, and rather clumsy. Their ordering system (the use of mobile devices) is not very fluid either, having experienced network failure and app crashes occasionally. That being said, still quite worth the buck if you are on the Mission to find good sashimi. Rest of the food is good too. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average food at best,negative,20,14-Mar-13,"The fact that I lived a 10-minute walk away from this establishment but only visited the place 5 times in 6 years tells you all you need to know. Let's start with the good. It's spacious, ventilated, clean, you're spoilt for choice and there's a nice buzz about the place. Now for the not-so-good. If you're a food snob, there are other tastier places to go to for local food - way better. Secondly, the harrassment you receive from the hawker stall assistants can be frustrating. There are strict rules about touting at Newton and i tend to look the at my options from afar so as to not be pressured into making a decision. Next the price. Be aware, that Newton is a pricey neighbourhood just a stone's throw from Orchard Road. As such stall rentals are expensive and need to be covered. So expect to pay more for your food. Watch out for the seafood prices. Most locals won't go to Newton for the seafood so I would advice that you double check the price for prawns/crabs etc before placing your order. Lastly taxis can be a challenge to find when you're done eating/drinking so do be prepared to take the train/bus."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Great Breakfast,positive,40,8-May-17,The food here is good and the service is nice. We had a nice South Indian breakfast at the place and the Dosa was very good.

French,Paul,"Nice food, poor service",negative,20,3-Mar-13,"We went to Paul to have a quick dinner recently. The food was good and it was served quickly although the selection wasn't quite as large as in Paris for example.However, the whole experience was let down by the poor service that we received. We arrived there close to 9 PM and the restaurant wasn't busy. We stood in front of the restaurant and waited for a wait staff to find us a table. There was a group of staff that was just standing around and gossiping and one of them (a short, Chinese auntie-looking staff) saw us but just ignored us and continued to gossip with her colleagues. Another wait staff (a Chinese guy) also saw us but also ignored us and continued to sashay past us. We must have waited for close to 5 mins before a Malay waitress greeted us and showed us to a table. We were also ignored again during the short time we were in the restaurant.I understand that this is Singapore, where service is horrible and basically non-existent. But somehow I thought it would be different given the type of establishment this is. Clearly I was wrong. We won't be back, I don't think the food is phenomenal enough to make up for the poor service that we received."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Starting from the start...,negative,20,13-Aug-13,"Starting from the start.. We called to make a reservation but apparently they did not accept any, so we got there early to try to get a table. Sat outside for over 45min with little to no update from staff. Placed our orders and very specifically asked that for the steak sauce be served on the side to which the wait staff noted and affirmed. I ordered the Homemade duck foie gras terrine.. my bad for not asking what terrine meant (I was expecting the pan friend type). All the same, it was average at best. Free flow of fries as advertised.. nothing to complain about there. Great if you like your carbs. The steak was a different story. The Steaks:The quality of the steak itself was just a little better than the stuff u get at foodcourts. Tad larger but if you are the kind of person that really savours your cow, you will know that true quality wasn't even average.Next, the website advertised 2 servings of steak. Naturally we were expecting a second portion to come at some point only to be told that they had put the equivalent of both portions on our 1 serve - 200g topS! . SERIOUSLY?! Why would you advertise 2 servings, a) serve our ""2 portions"" in a single serving, b) that was really less than the size of one standard portion anywhere in the world, c) without our asking, d) shrug us off when we ask, e) then go ahead to the next door table to provide their second serving??! why?The plus side imo is the sauce. It is a pretty tasty sauce that the steak is apparently cooked in. I must say that I suspect it plays a major part in the other good impressions of this place because it completely masks the actual meat quality. Oh but wait... didn't we ask for sauce on the side?!So heres the thing, my sister is gluton intolerant (just shy of Celiac disease). So here came the steaks all soaked in sauce right? When we raised the point that we had requested all sauce to be served on the side, guess what, the gave her a portion with the sauce just flicked or wiped off. Naturally we called the lady manager again who flicked us off again and just said ""its not our policy to serve with sauce on the side"". Seriously?! policy? firstly your staff should not have acknowledged and accepted our request if it wasn't policy. Fine staff will be staff. You most certainly should not have just wiped off the sauce and served it all the same. Yes YOU because you were solely responsible for distributing the meats from the platter that came out of the kitchen. Also, saying 'not our policy' and trying to walk off before a customer can respond is completely unacceptable. I accept your subsequent apology after nailing your bottom to the floor as to whether you or your restaurant would bear the medical consequence of a gluten caused reaction by my sister. I guess its hard to worm you way out of it when public liability is involved. The starters aren't too bad relative to price relative terms. Think of this place as budget french dining with budget staff, fantastic sauce and lousy cow. Oh ya.. and cramped.. very tight space. Please tell me if you disagree... we'll have our doctors assist you with your query."

Almost as much as it stressed me a bit.. I had chilli crab, which was good, but perhaps not as exciting as I had expected. The best part of the meal was the baby cabbage steamed in lots of garlic. I am not convinced that I will go back here, cause I have tasted better food a lot cheaper in this city."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Don't be a sheep to give in to media manipulations. Riding on a bad pun of another restaurant.,negative,10,06/21/15,"Well, as stated above. my fellow Singaporeans, open your eyes and stop being media manipulated.The food is bad, seriously bad. And with prices like that, i scoff in disgust. Apparently not the 45min-1hr wait time crowd.when you are charging $12-15++ per portion of roasted meat, it better be freaking good, ESPECIALLY if that said portion is only enough for 1 person.Duck - tasteless, soggy skin, crappy 'sauce' ( 70% oil in sauce )Roast Pork - ridiculous portion (i literally laughed), Damn dry. Saw them microwaving some food items, perhaps it's pork?Char siew- passable, too sweet and cloying. Perfect if it's candied pork not char siew.Duck buns (Both black and white) - While the bun itself was good, the filling was Crap. too much Starch in the generic store-bought sauce with duck skin, barely (virtually none) any duck meat.Beef noodle soup - forgettable, with that much MSG, water also taste good.close to $100 for 3 pax, first and last time i get sheared like a sheep. Maybe the reason they omitted pricing on their website's menu is out of shame?Avoid this money focused mill. Even the roast pork stall inside serangoon nex NTUC was far superior (Not that they were any good to begin with) Felt like a tourist being sheared while leaving.Alternatives to good roasted duck is Dian xiao er, or any other place that doesn't take you for a fool."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Finger lickin Pepper crab and live steamed razor clams,positive,50,09/23/16,"Be realistic about what you're looking for, you want a place that does seafood (especially crab) and does it well.We normally don't do set menus but the S$148++ menu had what we wanted after reading reviews, the Black pepper crab that this company 'pioneered' and steamed live razor clams. Easy.The razor clams came out in individual serves, surrounded by a fragrant flavourful broth, and a garlicky vermicelli with sweet clam meat. Delicious. The pepper crab was just as expected, peppery goodness with lots of sweet mud crab meat. Don't be shy to lick your fingers. When the staff offer to pick the claw meat out for you, take up the offer. It ended up being half a crab each person (4 pieces each).We didn't really expect much from the next dishes but the fried leek flower with dried scallop and olive was a good taste bud refresher after the crab, followed by a bland looking but very tasteful deep fried flat noodle dish with clams. Also a theatrical dessert of rose jelly coconut cream, dry-ice drama and all. Not overly sweet, by refreshingWe went on a weekday lunch after an easy simple booking via website and prompt confirmation via email the day before. It wasn't busy at 1pm, the staff were absolutely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was casual but the service was a notch above, dishes flowed seamlessly and the wait staff were keeping tab on our progress to ensure this (at a distance of course). Some reviewers complained about the cost but expecting to pay rock bottom prices for seafood just bc you can get a $4 meal at a hawker centre in this country is unreasonable, the price was comparable to any decent mud crab/live seafood restaurant in other parts of the world. Also, I don't understand why you would give a bad review based on your definition of what lobster should taste like at a restaurant most people choose for the crab. We walked from the Tanglin gate of the botanic gardens, 20 minutes in midday heat but next time we'll use uber, the Dempsey hill area has lots of little roads leading to other retail outlets so you could end up walking around a bit to find Long beach at the back."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, location and atmosphere!!!",positive,40,9-Jan-15,"I am not an expert on Hawker Centres like this but when three of us visited this centre for dinner during our stay in Singapore we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had visited this particular centre about 6 years ago and think it has improved considerably.We had a mixture of seafood dishes of crab, prawns and octopus and all were perfectly cooked and totally enjoyable at a price that we considered reasonable. No 82 was the stall we used and they were good and helpful. The market was clean and maintained that way while we were there.It was also a pleasant experience due to the fact that while the various stall holders touted for your business they were not overly pushy as you might expected from these places. When visiting Singapore in the future will happily pay this place a visit again."

Beautiful octopus to start, seriously tasty white fish (can't remember the name), and to crown it all a wonderful red chilli crab and a a white pepper crab. We also had some chicken, vegetables, rice etc. Dessert was a mango pudding in a smoking glass which was a real treat too. Just wonderful. The taste, the quality, the quantity - all fabulous. Will be returning to try the black pepper crab too. The service was excellent, many waiting staff and the food came pretty quickly so not too much waiting. A good selection of wines also.Definitely worth a try."

The decor has been tastefully designed to provide a hint of the Chinese court yard, without feeling like you're in Disneyland. The service is so discreet ,polite, and helpful in making suggestions. But it the food that takes center stage here. Its creative, visually stunning and most of all, delicious. Do not come if you are on a diet; you will only torture yourself. It is impossible to resist asking for seconds and third servings."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but....",negative,30,03/18/17,"Visited this restaurant ten years ago and had happy memories. This visit found the food much the same. A good selection of yum Cha and mains. Service was adequate and fast. We arrived late morning and by the time we left, about 1.00pm, the tables were mostly taken. Entry to this restaurant can be confusing as the street entrance is hidden under a covered footpath which is crowded by stalls. Walk up a flight of stairs and follow your nose to enter the restaurant. One big complaint is that when my wife went to the restroom she returned saying it was very dirty and she would need to seek another restroom. I visited the gentlemen's and found the same although I managed a successful visit. Some Asian countries are known for poor lavatory management and it was a surprise to find this in a well established restaurant in Chinatown. On the basis of the restrooms, we would not return and recommend only if you have a strong bladder"

My friends enjoyed the food, the dim sums are fresh (especially those with prawns), and I findthe service greatly improved from my last visit. The moment I flipped over the cover of the tea pot (meaning that they should refill the pot) someone quickly took the pot away and came back with a fresh pot of tea. We left behind one small pau, but one of the elderly waitress saw this and insisted we should not waste and she went to put it in a small bag for us. I will visit again."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Noisy busy and crowded for lunch – with very good food,positive,40,02/26/17,"This is a great place for dim sum, but not if you’re a novice. It’s too crowded to bring around carts so you can see what you’re getting. So you order everything off a paper menu by noting how many of a particular dish you want. So if you don’t mind the noise and can go with someone who knows their way around dim sum, the food is excellent."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",INCREDIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE,positive,50,15-Mar-15,"We chose Shinji by Kanesaka for our last dinner in Singapore and it was so beyond our expectations that we will long remember it as the standard for fine sashimi. You should know what you are getting yourself into before you go otherwise you might be a little overwhelmed. We ordered the Omakase at Singapore $330 each. For two hours we were entertained by these masters and fully satiated with the most exquisite sashimi we have ever tasted. We ordered a premium carafe (or three!) of sake, which tasted like silk. From the glass fish to the baby tuna, the Horse Head fish soup to the octopus it just kept coming. It is going to be impossible to top this!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Little modern Tokyo,positive,50,15-Jul-16,Tepanyaki style in MBS. Always pleasure to come back and never feel like being in the casino as you got into the restaurant.

Good selection of Sake and wine lists but too much mark up on wine lists.

No wonder it is always included in the search results of top 10 chili crab in Singapore.I recommend the following dishes: black pepper crab, crispy baby squid, steam grouper in Hong Kong style soy sauce, roast chicken and baby kailan. These were paired with fried rice with tiny fried silver fish. Really nice fresh taste of the steamed fish and nice juicy tender roast chicken.I also can't complain about the individual service of the waiters. Courteous, and attentive. They knew what to do and they were a pleasure to talk to and ask recommendations about the food.However, the kitchen just couldn't cope with the full house of diners. Our food was served one dish at a time. Delivery was much too delayed. Lastly, the steamed grouper came 20 mins after the first item was placed on the table. Diners cannot enjoy their meal if the dishes are served piecemeal.Would have rated this resto 5 stars."

Kailash Parbat has several stores in India and overseas. I have been to their Mumbai store several times and just love it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the menu is simply great – vast and offers everything from north Indian food to south Indian food to Indian street food to Indian sweets. The Masala chole bhature was the best I have had in years (my 1 year toddler even gobbled up few bites and was wanting more), and the Papri chaat was so so wonderful – just perfect – full of flavours. They also serve authentic sindhi cuisine – yumm dal pakwaan – very few places in the world which serves sindhi food. I might have to move to Singapore just to be able to eat here more regularly or visit Singapore more often!The price was cheap and the food was delicious and flavourful. The staff were lovely and attentive too. You are not likely to find better Indian food, certainly not at the price, anywhere in Singapore. Kailash Parbat is about authenticity and keeping it real- real good Indian soul food. My top 5 favourite dishes at KP are Pav Bhaji, Masala Chole Bhature or the Bhature Platter, Chaat Platter, Papdi chaat and their selection of lassi’s. "

The starter Foe Gras Terrine was served with a big patch of Green Blue MOULD!!!the waitress apologised to us a few times "" I'm sorry, I think that one was EXPIRED!"" let me get you another one from a new batch, like anyone would be just fine with eating the animal organ gone bad!!! I better don't get food poison in the next 24 hours, Or I will definitely report you. if it wasn't my date insisted to stay, I would have walked out of that restaurant, My appetite was completely ruined, and they charged us for that dish anyways, that's how sorry they were! Sick to the stomach literately, I wonder if the food in that fridge are as fresh as the terrine! and the FRIES are served in whole big plate, BUT there's no ketchup, mayo, no dip! you must eat the fries DRY!! yes it was so fantastic $100 SGD dining experience that's disgusting!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good ambience and tasty chat,positive,40,19-Mar-15,"We visited few times Belilios lane one. Few days back my friend came from Japan it happened to visit infront of Mustafa one. We like the Ragada Sev Puri its very tasty. The Chaas was very good. The Hyderabadi Biryani loved it.The over all, the place is good for chaat and vegetarian food. The price wise its above average compare to other restuarants in that area."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Birthday Celebration,positive,50,4/9/2017,"We are really enjoyed our birthday dinner. The food and service were excellent. special thank you to all the staffs at Peach Blossoms. Mr Alden, Terry, Nobel, Sook Teng, Mun Fung, Christine and Akira. They have made a memories dinner for us. "
French,L_Angelus,Charming French restaurant on Club Street!,positive,50,31-Mar-18,"What started off as a meeting place for a group of 4 couples, ended up being a fantastic evening in this charming restaurant. The entrance is quite charming but placid and doesn't quite prepare you for the interiors. As we entered, we were absolutely delighted with the warm interiors! The bar is quite close to the entrance which is presumably meant for patrons waiting to be seated, but we did see casual walk-ins as the evening progressed. We found their French wine collection to be very extensive! The posters on the walls also made the whole restaurant very warm and cosy.I think the complimentary warm bread rolls went down perfectly with the wine along with the butter that was served with it. The goat cheese salad deserves a special mention among the entree selections. In the mains, we shared the pan seared sea bass, pan fried Dover sole (both excellent!), marinated lamb racks (done to perfection as requested by one in our group), and the roasted chicken in a cream sauce was superb. One of our friends was vegetarian and they rustled up delightful plate of vegetables (see foto below).While we ordered both the creme brûlée and the Warm chocolate cake, it was really the chocolate one which was the winner! It was truly fabulous as they claim it to be."
French,L_Angelus,I do not understand some commentaries,positive,50,21-Nov-14,I had a wonderfull evening excellent red wine with perfect temperature. Escargots and cote de veau perfect. Service. Very good. I can really recommend this place.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with Entertainer app,positive,40,28-Nov-16,"Sashimi was fresh and variety is quite good. I particularly enjoyed the pumpkin chawanmushi which is not found in other japanese restaurants. We used Entertainer app so we only paid the price of one for both of us which made the lunch very value for money. The only downside was the tablet for ordering the food. The tablet was not responsive at times and it resulted in us double-ordering as we sent the orders twice, thinking the first time was not captured as the system hanged. As such we had double orders on some dishes which meant we had less stomach for trying other dishes."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Some of the best food i've tasted,positive,50,8/2/2015,"The nasi goreng was excellent. So simple yet so good. Love the silverfish and the bean sprouts. The crunchiness was just right with the right amount of sodium that left me wanting for more.The fried kailan with garlic was amazingly perfect. It was soft and crunchy at the same time. Perfect texture. Not salty, not overfried. The cook really knew how to make fried kailan.Chilli crab was delicious. The gravy was cooked to perfection. I should have asked for a recipe."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Takeaway,positive,40,30-Jul-13,We picked up Papri chats as a takeaway and four plates set us back about 33 Sin Dollars. The portions were very generous and the taste delicious.The restaurant itself is quite large
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood Experience away from the bright lights,positive,40,09/19/15,"Making the trip to Dempsey Road, near Holland Village is worth your taxi fare. Being welcomed by all staff at the front door and being ushered into the Restaurant surrounded by large glass tanks brimming with fresh and very active seafood.The initial ""wow"" was tempered by the extensive range of extremely fresh crabs, lobsters, fish plus anything else you can name. The sight of large live Alaskan Crabs is worth a visit without even looking at the extensive range of other seafood.Oysters - some of the best I have ever had and this comes from someone who lives on the Western Australian coast!The staff were attentive without being ""in your face"" and they had as much fun as we did over an enjoyable luncheon.Food prices very reasonable but, as usual, alcohol was expensive and no shock as this seems to be the practice - charge maximum dollars for alcoholic drinks.The visit to Long Beach was well worth it - great meal, great venue and away from the normal hustle and bustle of the city centre. Try it you will not be disappointed. "
French,Saveur,Concetto by Saveur,positive,50,25-Jul-16,"Im not sure if this was the same place as I had been before (they were serving lots of pasta before). Much to my demise, I couldn't get to have pasta again. The set meal was very filling but very pricey."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average Food, Bad Service, Not value for money",negative,10,1-Apr-17,"Bad service: Food took an extremely long time to arrive on our table for the very little amount of food we have ordered. When we need someone to attend to us to refill our tea pot, we have to press more than 6 times on the tablet and no one attended to us. We have to go to the service staff directly (none was around our section) to get it refilled. Food: Sashimi was fresh and good. Yakitori are too hard/tough for comfortable chewing. The serving were miserable. We ordered bacon wrapped with asparagus and the serving is so small. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing dim sum,negative,20,03/31/16,Popped in here for a quick casual dim sum dinner and left disappointed. The prawn with mango was the the highlight. Friendly staff but significantly inferior to both Spring Court and Yann Palace. Will not return
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Grumpy person behind the food counter,negative,20,1-Jun-15,"Went this morning to pick up some Idlis. The place was empty and yet the guy behind the food counter insisted on slowly cleaning up the place, making a dosa - and while the Dosa was getting cooked, not bothering to pack up the Idlis...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Shop 66 for Chilli Stingray,positive,50,13-Nov-13,"If you head to shop 66 for the best chilli stingray, I always go back there to Stanley when I'm in town. Love this with a nice cold beer! Its really just a local outside food court with the best chilli stinray."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,just a matter of personal taste,negative,30,05/29/15,"a lot of people talk about this restaurant thought the food was OK not bad but also not inline with the prices and the expectations

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Impeccable service, fantastic food",positive,50,8/4/2016,Was here with my family on a Sunday. Place was well staffed and service was quick and personalised. Food recommended was great and quick to arrive! Kudos to Nobel and Terry for the memorable visit!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Number 39 in the World,positive,50,8-Jan-13,"This restaurant offers a dining experience which is comparable only with the best. It is the 39th Best Restaurant in the World and the experience here is world class. We have eaten at many Michellin rated restaurants in France and the UK and this restaurant by Tetsuya Wakuda more than holds it own. The meal opens with each couple having a chef working opposite in teppanyaki style, four people to a room. There the tepanyaki resemblance ends, the chef discussing each dish and presenting it with matching wines on a degustation basis. After 9 courses with matching wines, one proceeds to the open section of the restaurant to enjoy two delicious desserts followed by coffee or tea and petit fours.We were lucky enough to meet Tetsuya in the kitchen after our meal and this was really the meal of a lifetime. Try it!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Chineses Cuisine,positive,40,7/8/2014,Try to eat at Crystal Jade Restaurant. The food are delicious and savory. The price is affordable too. Friendly and accommodating waitresses.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A great find,positive,50,05/23/15,"Our concierge recommended this restaurant. It did not disappoint. Delicious food, friendly, helpful staff and coeliac friendly. Whole mud crab for $72. The place was full of locals and the food very fresh. Definitely recommended."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","overpriced, crowded, too much hussle and hassle",negative,20,6-Apr-13,"we went for a quick family dinner and having lived in Singapore for many years we feel quite ""local"", but here we were treated like fresh off the airplane foreigners and the prices quoted for fish and seafood were way beyond what market price is elsewhere. Vist for the experience but take care!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great lunch ,positive,50,07/15/18,"We have just had the best Yum Cha in Chinatown in Singapore. Great food, fried noodle scallops, fried crab claws,Beijing duck,roasted pork all really good. Can highly recommend this experience in Chinatown."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),B.d lunch.,positive,50,11/7/2016,"Made a reservation through Terry. Was there for my b.d lunch with family. We got ourself a nice seating next to the wine rack. The ambience was nice and comfy not too loud and was quite relaxing to be able to hear the birds chirping outside. The staffs were extremely helpful and observant to details. The foods tasted delicious and were well presented, my recommendation goes to the soya sauce chicken. Lastly, Terry prepared a nice gift together with the cake on a plate where he penned down his well wishes in mandarin. This is my 2nd time having my b.d celebrated over a meal with family there, peach blossom never fails to impress. Thank you. "
French,Saveur,Downhill,negative,20,15-Oct-17,"My 3rd visit since 3 years back, but that was in their Far East branch.
Was a bit hard to get service, they weren't too attentive. Fair enough to say that it was Friday night and it was almost full house. 2 of our mains...More"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crabs I've Had,positive,40,9/11/2015,"Strictly speaking, there is one more restaurant that serves equally good pepper crab. That is Keng Eng Kee. But Long Beach is consistent. KEK is perhaps 80% of the time.Coming back to Long Beach, yes, This is the signature dish that you must try. Of course it has other good food, but those are merely good, not outstanding.Chili crab? I think Jumbo at Dempsey Hill does it better."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Family Dinner,positive,50,25-Mar-18,The food is very tasty and good. You find variety of options. Good place for pure vegetarians. We enjoy having food @ KP.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A classy decor with great Chinese Cooking.,positive,40,9/8/2017,Stayed at the MM hotel for two nights and tried dining at this Chinese Restaurant. Quite skilful and refine cooking especially on the roast duck and wasabi prawn. The abalone mushroom was great. Service is five star and personnel are courteous and responsive. 
French,Paul,"Poor Service, Poor Product",negative,20,27-Mar-16,"Went to the Paul cafe at Paragon - staff were poor, had to keep chasing to get order. Bring cakes but no drinks, then eventually bring drinks after finished our cakes, then have to ask for milk for the tea...can't even do the basics right! The food and drinks were also poor, so all round it wasn't good and won't be back to this cafe again!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good service, great steaks (and chips)",positive,40,3-Aug-13,"Overlooking the upper reaches of the river on Robertson Quay this restaurant offers good value for simple food, well-prepared. Three of us had steak and chips, one had lamb and sausage kebabs and chips. With a bottle of wine and other drinks the bill as 75$S each, or about 38GBP."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,The steak!,positive,40,5-May-17,Loved the steak with the sauce. Sauce truly made the dish. Fries were nice and crisp. The salty caramel cake was the perfect way to end the meal.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice food,positive,40,23-Aug-17,Food was good for ala carte jap food ...service abit slow as they are v busy with the crowd . Good for gatherings!

French,Angelina_MBS,"Best Hot Chocolate Drink served in a delightful, serious manner.",positive,40,22-Jan-16,"What I love from Angelina is the Tarte Tout Chocolate. The crunchy praline biscuit and the soft dark chocolate ganache alleviated the richness of the tart, I couldn't stop savouring in each bite.The other signature of Angelina is the Old-fashioned Hot Chocolate “L’African”. Just like melted chocolate, smooth and rich, this was definitely not for the faint hearted. The portion came in an entire jug, but was served in smaller cups, accompanied with the whipped cream that complemented the cocoa drink. It was perfect for sharing among us.Read more at UrbanOutEaters to know more about my three times visiting Angelina.I always enjoyed my time and my meal at Angelina. Lovely venue, elegant and kind staff, delicious desserts and the best thick hot chocolate served in a delightful, serious manner."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Just gets better each time,positive,50,30-Aug-18,"Been here many a time over the years, used to be very popular with local families, food was served on banana leaves and apart from chopsticks, the utensil of choice was your hands.Roll on 20 years, the hawker stands are all on the outside of the open air area, pick a stand/food style you like and enjoy, some places give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready.We arrived as a party of 7, all wanting different food, this place is ideal, just getting a table is the hardest part. My favourite stand is no 31, try the stingray, absolutely fantastic, with seafood fried rice and morning glory veg dripping with garlic. Indonesian, Thai, local Singapore and Indian as well as traditional and specialised Chinese is all available.Prices are getting higher, but as usual we over ordered, about $25 Singapore dollars for a fabulous meal"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive hawker food,negative,20,16-May-12,"Overpriced, overrated hawker food. You are better off visiting Lau Pa Sat"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top of the line sushi,positive,50,23-Oct-16,"We were there to celebrate our 25 th wedding anniversary. In a small room with 8 seats, chef Ishizawa showed his talents in 2 hours. Everything in the restaurant except water was brought from Japan. Every bit we tasted was so fresh and tasty. Sea urchin from Hokkaido was spectacular, I had not tasted such a good sea urchin even in Japan. The sake menu was quite good. The chef is a very nice person full of humor :) The price is quite high but it is worth eating at least one time in a lifetime.."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,positive,50,01/23/18,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private rooms and plenty of seats for outside dining . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Poor service, below average food",negative,20,8/12/2015,"We found that place because of the ""Singapore Restaurant Month"", where they were supposed to have a special dish, celebrating Singapore's 50 years of independence. Upon arriving, we stood there, waiting to be seated, as it is usual around the city. At least half a dozen waitresses passed us by and none of them even care to address us or even nod. Since the restaurant was not so full, we decided to get a table on our own. Little we know, the bad service was just starting to show.The special dish was in a separate menu over the table, so we decided to order it. The waiter simply told us that we could only order it after 6PM, even though there was absolutely no such information on the website or even at the menu. We then decide to move to the dim sums, as they are supposed to be the house specialty. Granted, some of them were good, but most of them were too greasy, even those that were supposed to be stir fried.The place itself it's also not very clean (on our way out we noticed it received a 'B' grade from hygiene inspectors, which is below many food stalls).Bottom line, if you want a good dim sum around town, you'll be better off with Dim Tai Fung. It's more expensive, but it's also on a completely different level."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over-rated,negative,30,29-Nov-16,The portion of the fries wasn't distribute well. Presentation was very bad. The whole chunk of fries over the steak. We wasn't told that there 2nd serving of steak. But the salad was very nicely done.
French,L_Angelus,Home-y is the word. A place to chill.,negative,30,6-Oct-08,Home-y is the word. A place to chill.
French,Poulet,Affordable Lunch,negative,30,2-Dec-16,"Been years since we last visited. We ordered their set combo for 2 pax. Very satisfying and filling combo set which includes 2 choice of drinks, 2 x mushroom soup, 2 side dishes, Salad de Paris and Poulet Roti.The chicken was deeply flavoured with a tint of citrus taste in the meat. We felt the mushroom chardonnay sauce was unnecessary because that would actually cover up the aroma from the meat and made the chicken skin less appetising. Overall experience "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food but not that good,negative,30,14-Apr-17,"They offers all kinds of vegetarian food.
One advantage is it is 24 hours open restaurant.
Service is good.
South Indian food is good. But North indian food is average taste.
Value for money since cost is not that high."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Actually very good,positive,40,15-Jan-14,Good ol steak frites much like you would expect in a good cafe in a major European city. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Make sure you sit outside if possible as the inside has exactly zero atmosphere. Dont both with the beef from Normandy just get the regular sirloin with fries and a side you like and off you go. Enjoy.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Ok lah,negative,30,28-Feb-08,Ok lah
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,positive,40,20-Jul-17,"Overwhelming choices of food :-). I am sure each stall has nice food.Especially good was the satay with the peanut sauce. We got them from a stall on the very first row. Open atmosphere, good for evening but might be too hot for a sunny day. Only limited covered places available when raining!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",great food,positive,50,23-Jul-15,I like the prawns side dish and the mutton briyani. the briyani is so gd to eat. delicious food. AT that time I was alone and was shopping around tekka area. I was talking with my friend on the hp when I spotted the restaurant....More
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best dining experience,positive,50,23-Feb-13,"Been to many fancy places, but never felt as special @ Shinji... You of course get a 5 star service from Shinji just like you do from other establishments at this level. But something about seeing your food handcrafted with care, skill and passion make dining experience at Shinji extra special.The seafood is as fresh as it can be. The poor prawn was alive and kicking 5 mins before it landed on my plate in the form of sushi...the seafood selection is wide range, from the usual tuna to abalone to conch to sea urchin to white bait to ......The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Very good, but....",positive,40,17-May-16,"The meat and vegetables are great, but French fries are a bit overcooked, too burned for us.
And the desserts are a bit too sweet.
Apart from that, for meat lovers, it is delicious!"

Lamb Chops were superb. It took 15 minutes to get a beer but the food arrived quickly.
In Singapore this represents real value and quality."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Kinda basic, but the food is great!",positive,40,06/20/12,"My husband and I have been to Yum Cha a couple of times now, once in 2010 and once just last month. It's a fairly decent restaurant, slightly hidden away if you don't know where it is - the restaurant is kinda sparse, hence my 'basic' title .. there are no fancy frills here! The staff are ok, I mean they do their job and serve you quickly, but it's a place for striking up conversation or having a joke with the staff .. it's just about serving (which is fine, though can sometimes come across a little unfriendly). The food however is amazing! We love the dim sum, congee, and there are these amazing prawn and mango rolls which are just incredible! In 2010 we also had some kind of deep fried prawns hung over the side of a half carved out pineapple - we couldn't get that this time but they do still serve it, and it's delicious! Even though the service/decor is pretty ordinary, the food is amazing, and it's a perfect spot to go for lunch or dinner after spending the day in Chinatown. We'll always go back!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can't describe how good this place is,positive,50,3-Mar-15,"Being a harsh critic and being to so many fine dining restaurants in the world this tops the list.Starting with the service, the chefs, the food and the atmosphere.Yes it's expensive but 100% you will not experience this again unless you come here.10/10 and if we come back to Singapore we would be sure on making a reservation. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper crab,positive,40,05/23/14,"First of all i have to admit i am a little biased as black pepper crab is probably my most favourite dish in Singapore, so most trips for me are excellent. However I have been to long beach many times, at both Dempsey and at the East Coast, and its definitely one of my top choices! Boasted as the 'creators' of the black pepper crab they certainly never disappoint! Its spicy and fresh and always makes for an awesome, fun (and often rather messy) evening dinner. I highly recommend you give it a try and I will certainly continue to keep coming back!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Nice indian fare,positive,40,13-Oct-13,Coming back from india i wanted to taste the indian food option in singapore. So i visited this place. Food is good specially south indian dishes. Price ok. Service is slow. Can repeate any time
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Fabulous dinner!!!!!!!,positive,50,03/14/17,"Yesterday, my family and I had the pleasure to dine at Peach Blossoms for dinner with my grandparents. Although it was very crowded, the staff were extremely friendly and the service was fast. The dishes were succulent and main courses tantalizing. Coupled with the high quality desserts we ordered(fried durian), it is fair to say that we had the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb selection and quality of food!,positive,40,14-Sep-17,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Shin Minori. Some colleagues and I visited for their lunch buffet and to our amazement, the claim of having more than 160 dishes is fo'real! There was a wide selection of dishes from rice and noodles to soup, sushi, sashimi, appetizers, maki, yakitori and teppanyaki - all this for $45 (including service charge and government tax). Service was good and the waiters were very responsive. The ambience is quiet and peaceful and I like that they do not enforce a time limit for the buffet. A little tip: if you go on their website, you'll find vouchers for special add-on items (for free). We were gifted a free snow crab nabe that was deeelicious! I have recommended this place to friends and family and will definitely be doing a second round there. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,I would recommend the Da...,positive,40,3/11/2008,"I would recommend the Da Shiao Mian (not sure if the the pinyin is correct), the La Mian with Stewed Beef (the beef tendon very succulent and juicy) and of course the Xiao Long Bao"
French,Poulet,Worked For Us,positive,40,21-Sep-15,"Our hotel was across the road from the Chinapoint Mall so it was the obvious place to look for a meal. We stopped over for just one night, and thoroughly sick of the heavy meals in the UK, we were looking for somewhere to have a decent light salad for lunch before heading to the airport. It is difficult to find salad in Singapore but Poulet had three different choices. We chose smoked duck, which was melt in the mouth stuff; the various components of the salad that went with it were lovely and fresh, with a very nice raspberry oil drizzled over it. It was a quiet day with only one other table being occupied, and being lunch time I had an iced tea and my husband only had water, which was offered as soon as we were seated. The service was friendly (a staff member offered to take a photo of the two of us at the table) and immediate - we couldn't fault it, and the price was what we expected - quite acceptable."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very authentic sushi experience in singapore,positive,50,13-Jun-16,"I think out of all the premium sushi restaurants in Singapore, this is one that match up to Tokyo micheline sushi restaurant.

French,Poulet,quick!,negative,30,5-May-15,i had the duck and my friend had the lamb. both dishes looked pretty much the same. however the meat was fall of the bone kinda good!

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Definitely must go for seafood in city center,positive,40,12/30/15,"Very tasty and delicious seafood. Great location, across from the Botanical Gardens. Nicely located in greenery with various bars walking distance for after meal drinks. Fast service. Definitely a genuine taste of Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",NOT BAD!!,positive,40,15-May-14,"Food is good, however it takes a while for your food to be served, quite expensive compared to other restaurants near by! however have to admit the Chat's were nice. and the food portion is quite small, not recommended for big family!pricing is a little too high and the service staff tend to ignore your preferences if the restaurant is full!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hard to believe there are 62 better in Singapore~,positive,50,23-Mar-13,"I was fortunate to first eat at Testuya's establishment in Rozelle, Sydney.Along with the local chilli crab, eating here was to be one of the highlights of a five day eating jaunt with a girlfriend for our respective birthdays.She has never eaten Testuya's food, but as a chef is well versed as to his creativity and notoriety ...she was blown away !Fortunately, once inside the calming environs one easily forgets you are on the 2nd floor of a casino.The private dining room was a haven.The staff friendly, efficient.. special mention must go to our 'private chef' Kaz, also formerly of Sydney who was most engaging both about the fare we were about to consume and local tips !{ Thank you, we took your advice and went the next day for lunch ~was worth getting wet in the afternoon thunderstorm}The next few hours was hynagogic.Whether it was the enlarged 'golf ball' in my scotch tumbler, to the simple but superb crockery the evening was sublime.No need to describe the ingredients..sourced world wide.Being asked whether any allergies or dislikes is welcomed..it would be dismal to waste any of the ten courses that one is about to indulge.The combinations presented were visually enticing...and tasted even better.With an excellent wine list and some great martinis the evening was worth the flight from Melbourne.I was fortunate to explore the cellar after dinner..it was akin to a library, with bottles from every conceivable wine producing nation.Dessert with a view, the BEST(must be an Australian barista) coffee in all of Singapore and conversation with fellow guests from Venezuela and Israel, completed a food experience second to none.Is it cheap ? Of course not. If however, one is ‘in’ to food and the experience of dining like this, it is affordable gratification.Enjoy."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the touts!,negative,30,17-Jan-12,"It's quite touristy and the prices reflect it. It's more expensive than going to Lau Pa Sat or a smaller local place, but the food is good. Always cheaper than a proper restaurant, just prepare to get hassled by the stalls as you walk past. The best bet is to just walk around the whole place and look at each stall to see what you want to get - don't let the hawkers get too pushy - if you tell them no then they should leave you alone. Check prices before you order - especially things like crab which are done by weight. Confirm what size you'll be charged for."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Integrity at Alliance Seafood at Newton Hawker Ctr,positive,40,6-Aug-17,"Ordered a stingray about 4 weeks ago at this store. Turned out to be tough and dry. Upon telling the store the inedible dish, the store assistant offered me a different dish free of charge. However at that time I had ordered a similar dish from an adjacent store so I declined. To my pleasant surprise, Alliance promptly refunded the dish in FULL. As a local Singapore which had eaten at numerous hawker centers, I had never experienced a full refund, bar none, no matter how bad the food was. Well done Alliance! Am coming back to try your other dishes as I know I will be eating in peace!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overhyped & overpriced,negative,30,20-Oct-15,The food is mediocre and the location unimpressive. Merely targetting the gullible tourist. I'd give this place a miss and opt for takeaway from the neighbouring 7/11.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great memories! Thanks!,positive,50,7/2/2017,"Had my Solemnization luncheon here on 28 June 2017 and being served professionally by Mr. Alden Gan & his team who has provided my guest and I a very comfortable luncheon experience in Peach Blossoms (Lotus Room). Despite a slight shock to my nephew due to the waiter who accidentally drop a plate from his tray to the floor, and perhaps personally I felt that the soup was slightly salty for me. Nevertheless, the great service with delicious food and its overall ambience compensate it all. Initially we booked at 12 pm, but due to some circumstances we arrived early to the restaurant at 11.15 am in the midst of setting up the room, but Mr. Alden & his team done their best to speed up and set up everything nicely and allowed our guests to enter around 15 minutes later! Amazing! The dishes has been distributed and served individually for the convenience of our guest. We ordered a customized set meal which served 7 dishes with 1 dessert. The black chicken soup starter was delicious! Loved the Peking Duck too, was hoping for more though hahahaha! Great Mango pudding dessert! Thanks Mr. Alden & team!Summary- Food taste: 4.5 / 5- Food presentation on each plate: 4.5 / 5- Ambience: 5 / 5 - Table setup: 5 / 5- View from Lotus Room: 5 / 5 (Thumbs up! Overlooking Shenton Way.)- Room size: 4 / 5 (Slightly cramp for two big tables for 22 pax, but its still great!)- Service: 4 / 5 (Slight delay on the serving of food, in coincidence there was another private lunch too, thus the waitress & waiter have to served both rooms.)- Price: As stated $$$$, but worth it!- Overall: Deserved 5 / 5 and highly recommended for private functions!"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Should change both name and cook,negative,20,6-May-15,"Such great location felt wasted. I entered to have tandoori food, only buffet was available, with lone tandoor item 'chicken tandoor', taste was surely the worst among others. And to be frankly, none of the items could pass an average marking. Price is reasonable."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The Popular Newton Hawker Centre!,positive,50,19-May-17,"This centre serves lots of the Singapore local authentic food and they are not too expensive. Most tables are in the open space and they are always filled with the locals. I went there twice with my family to eat and ordered many dishes to share. Try their satay, fish soup, cockles, gong gong, Singapore laksa and otah! They are also famous for their chillie stingray and ask for the meaty piece so you don't get too many bones! Singapore being such a humid country, I never failed to order my favourite thirst quenching sugar cane juice straight from the presser! Love it!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Water bottle full of mold,negative,30,25-Sep-17,"We've dined in this restaurants regularly for a few years. The food quality is pretty consistent throughout. However, I must say the service is not as good as before and the sitting space is getting smaller and smaller. In our last visit to Shin Minori last weekend, the water bottle that they gave us with the ice water is full of mold! No kidding, I wish i could post a photo here....tsk tsk"

French,Angelina_MBS,They are only good at desserts and nothing else,negative,30,20-Sep-15,"I was there for a casual lunch with 2 business associates. We ordered the 2 course set lunch ($37++) and shared two desserts. Set lunch consisted of a huge salad, which was acceptable in taste and presentation, and wagyu beef pasta. The beef was hard and the tomato sauce was obviously not freshly prepared. It reminded me of the typical $6-$8 pasta at food courts, which is heated up from frozen central kitchen packages. Although the portion was huge, each of us only finished about half the portion as the quality was bad. We decided to save our calorie quota for the desserts.We shared a chocolate eclair and a choux pastry called Josephine. The eclair was good but nothing extraordinary. Josephine was tart and fruity, so it was a welcome light dessert after the heaviness of the beef and pasta. What saved the day was the mini hot chocolate, which reminded me very much of the thick chocolate which I savoy red very morning when I was holidaying in Spain. How I wished I had a churro to dip into the thick chocolate drink! So, have your main meal elsewhere and go to Angelina just for your dessert. This is the place to be seen on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian fare,positive,40,4-Apr-17,I am a regular at Kailash Parbat in India and hence did not hesitate trying it at Singapore as well. It has some really good dishes. None of the dishes we ordered disappointed. The bread portions are quite good too. Its little more expensive than other India eateries but you wouldn't feel because the food is so good.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great buffet,positive,40,29-Aug-18,Definitely go for the buffet! If you have The Entertainer App you can get this as 1 for 1 which is very great value for money! I always eat WAY too much though!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good deal with 1 for 1 card promotion,negative,30,4-Oct-16,Sashimi is of good quality ... Other food that we tasted not as expected ... So just rate overall as average. But the 1 for 1 credit card promo makes it much more worthy of the visit
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Japanese Buffet!,positive,50,19-Nov-17,"Arguably one of the best Japanese buffets I've ever had so far. If you're really particular about your sashimi, then Shin Minori probably wouldn't disappoint as their thickly-sliced sashimi is really fresh and delicious. I'd certainly go back there again for my next sashimi indulgence."
French,Poulet,Thirsty? We don't care.,negative,20,8-Jul-15,"This one gets a 2 because the food was good. We asked for 4 different dishes and all were well made, better than expected for such a restaurant. But a restaurant is not only about the food. There is more pleasure in eating good food when the service makes you feel welcome, and Poulet did not make us feel welcome. What irritated me is that we had arrived feeling very thirsty and we were not offered a glass of water. I could see a jar of water by the cashier and waited many minutes to see a waiter on site. When I finally got a waiter, I asked him for cold water to which he replied that they had no cold water but only hot water and that the glass would cost us 50 cents a piece! This is something I've never heard of: restaurants charging for tap water. Water is a basic need, especially in hot places like Singapore, and it should be common courtesy in a restaurant to serve it liberally. I only did not get up to leave because we had 2 hungry kids with us. We ended up asking for mineral water because we'd not pay for tap water, much less hot tap water (Yes, I know this is exactly what they wanted us to do). Poulet really lost me there. I'll never return because I see this as pure stinginess. Considering their high prices (you've got to ask for a few side dishes in order to get a complete, balanced meal with your expensive half chicken) and the fact that customers do pay for service charges, it's really bad and absolutely unreasonable that they would not serve cold water; therefore, I'd rate it a no-no for customer service friendliness, which -- let's be frank -- is all what a restaurant is about apart the food itself."
French,L_Angelus,Expensive for average food,negative,30,16-Jul-16,"Yet another French style 'bistro'. The interior is nice and ""chic"" and typically French. They have quite and extensive menu and wine list. The food was good (but very expensive) and well presented. Service is average. Overall I would say its a decent restaurant but over-priced. It seems to be the norm in Singapore that a lot of restaurants that provide average food and service feel the need to over charge in order to somehow give the impression that they better than what they are. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but was looking for more,negative,30,16-Oct-13,The food was good but not great. I liked the chili crab but Im sure I could have had a better version of it somewhere else. Its really hard to know exactly which stall will have the best food. The Chicken Rice I had was not good at all. We had better food at the satay stands close to Lau Pa Sat (closed for 2 more months apparently). I liked Makansutra better to be honest.
French,Angelina_MBS,Below standard,negative,10,18-Jan-18,"Firstly, not recommended at all.Food/dessert selection is very limited. At our visit, there were only 5 desserts to choose from, excluding signature Mont Blanc.Food quality is below standard. The shrimps in the pasta was not fresh with the mushy chalky texture. The portion is small. The bacon seems worse than the one in your school sandwich. Totally disappointed."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was good but felt cheated,negative,30,14-Jun-18,"Steak was great fries were even better.. However the staff asked me if i wanted water, and i said yes thinking it was non-chargeable.. before i could object she uncorked a bottle of evian water in front of my eyes. i looked down at the menu and was shocked to see it was $9! Foolish me for assuming water is free in an upscale european steakhouse, but still waitress could have been clearer and asked if i wanted bottled water."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A heaven for sea food lovers ,positive,40,06/28/16,"The Mecca for sea food lovers with the black pepper crab a must try! Loved it! The chilli crab palors before it. A special mention of the Singapore prawn curry, I loved it so much I bought loads of the curry paste to carry back with me. The place though has a peculiar smell but it is probably attributed to the sea food holding tanks which makes the decor of the restaurant. "

Would definately go back!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",overpriced teppanyaki,negative,20,14-Jun-11,"this was essentially a teppanyaki restaurant and you are paying a hefty premium on top of the air freight charges for flying in all the ingredients in from abroad. there is nothing ingenious in the preparation or the taste. It's obvious that tetsuya is trying to capitalize on his fame by charging maximum amount for minimal work. I agree with other reviewers that the lobsters tasted like rubber and the steak was tough. For the price I paid, I expect every dish to be exceptional. This, unfortunately, was not the case. Other than his signature dish of ebi and sea urchin, nothing was memorable. The atmosphere is also very sterile and not to mention no privacy whatsoever as the teppanyaki chef can hear every word you say, so the venue is neither suitable for business entertaining nor a romantic night out."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat par excellence,positive,50,1-Aug-16,I had been here 2 years ago and loved it. The first place that came to mind during my business trip this year was this one.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Intimate and Superb!,positive,50,24-Dec-16,"This discrete restaurant on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel is widely considered to serve the best sushi in Singapore and we were not disappointed! We enjoyed the $225 US omakase at a 10 person sushi bar in a private room in the back of the restaurant. It consisted of more than a dozen courses of some cooked, but mostly raw dishes and everyone was both a visual and a culinary delight. Excellent service and a thoughtful and fairly-priced sake list rounded out the experience. Expensive but a must stop for any serious sushi lover visiting Singapore."
French,Paul,People Queue for This?!,negative,30,4-Mar-14,"Very expensive food that makes you feel that you're paying in Euro. Elbow to elbow seating, ala Parisian cafes. People Queue for This?! Maybe the fengshui of this place is really good."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japan on a plate,positive,50,15-Aug-17,"Although we only walked in for the bar dinner rather than the restaurant dinner, we were treated as special guests.Food and wine are fabulous and the wagu beef amazing.We were fortunate that Tetsuya the owner was there and he generously spent some time with us. Next trip will definitely be the full experience. Decor was amazing with wonderful pottery from an Australian artist on display. Truly deserving of the Michelin award."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",For a quick taste of Hawker and local food,positive,40,16-Aug-12,"Yes, its a touristy and yes some elements are more expensive however if you want a quick look at Hawker style food, all sorts of local SE Asian cuisane, in a relatively family friendly enviroment then go Newton. Just as long as you dont take it all too seriously is a nice place to go. Restaurant owners will always annoy you however this is Asia and it happens, English is no problems.We go quite often when we feel like jsut getting out for a quick eat.We normally take a bottle of wine with us to eat as well and buy a beer to start then crack open some wine and they generally are OK with it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Slighty expensive omakase yet I enjoyed it,positive,50,16-Jun-15,"Opted for the Shinji at Raffles Hotel to see the much hyped cypress tree table. Bigger seating (16 if I counted correctly) than most of the sushi master restaurants in Ginza (Tokyo). Had the omakase shin menu. Indeed a tasting delight in my opinion cause every fish, fruit and vegetable is caught and cropped then flown in from Japan. One can taste the difference on the awabi, kinmedai and uni (Hokkaido and Kyushu) being served. The downside were the nigiri pieces were not up to mark cause they used less vinegar on the shari. Perhaps customers should be given a choice if they prefer a stronger taste. The akagai and simmered tuna pieces too fell short as both lacked a richer umami. Slightly more expensive compared to Tokyo for the price I paid excluding sake. Japanese beef or other grilled items except tuna steak was not part of the menu and didn't get the maki roll standard in most sushi courses. Worth it to sample one of the best restaurants in town once in a blue moon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A La Carte Buffet Style but Service need Major Improvement,negative,20,7-Dec-16,"A La Carte Buffet Style is good as the food is Hot but order is in a mess, some order is deliver wrong and repeated, some even never come.Chawamushi is very nice!Large group is not recommended as they have only 1 ordering tablet per table."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR NAPKINS,negative,10,10/12/2017,lol what a joke. You have to pay for the wet napkins that they give you. Crab is messy what do they expect you to do? Use the table cloths?? My boyfriend and I got a bad first impression since they were pushing the most expensive items on us and rushing us to order we should have known better. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Slightly off the tourist map, but totally worth visiting",positive,40,22-Jun-13,"Take the MRT, and walk the rest of the way – it's totally worth it. The food and drinks are excellent and cheap. You get a sense of the local culture at Newton Circus. I always cherish opportunities like this whenever I travel - a chance to interact with the locals on their turf.Mind you, being a foreigner, you will get harassed by the hawkers to try their stall over their neighbours. Other reviews dwelled a bit much on the pushiness of the people. It's not as bad as they make it sound."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place for pure vegetarian Indian cuisine,positive,40,5-Oct-15,"It's a nice and cosy place for Indian vegetarian cuisine in Singapore. They have two outlets and both of them are in the city area. There is one outlet which is opposite the Mustafa Center Gate-2.Along side the signature Indian dishes, one can also look forward for sweets, chats (pani-puri, delhi chaat, samaosa, etc) which is usually fresh and delicious.The service is professional. The place however may seem to be little pricey. A sumptuous meal for 2 people can be around S$ 40-45."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Superb!!,positive,50,09/16/13,"This was a superb experience in China Town. Look on google maps for location, and its upstairs in a little hotel. There was a fast moving queue, as this place is really popular with the locals. The food was absolutely delicious, and all freshly prepared. Once seated, the ladies come around with a trolley loaded with baskets of dim sum……just choose what you want to eat - get a mixture of baskets. I would avoid the spinach with garlic, as it was a plate of stalks……..they said it didn't come with leaves!!! Ummm!! But all in all, don't go to China Town without paying this little diamond a visit."

And the worst is I diarrhea after that meal..."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over HYPED ,negative,20,3/5/2016,"For the branding I would have to say really smart putting the name ""London"" in there. I bet many people would have mistaken this place coming from London, only the duck and it's not even from London it's from Ireland.Anyway enough of the history lesson, here is my verdict and as a fan of roast duck, I have my fare share of top ducks around HKG and London this one rank lowly if I were to compare with any of the restaurants I've tried.Taste wise i would have to agree the fats of the duck is really juicy but the let down came with the tenderness and the sauce let alone presentation (not that Goldmine has any beautiful presentation) but I just can't accept the pungent after taste you get.The Char siew is dry and bored with overly sweeten sauce. Wanton noodle was good with plump shrimps Wanton and al dente noodle but soup was just overly salty to my liking.The redeemer here is the liu sha bao, all I have to say try is their dim sum more than what they are known for.Don't expect much service as wait staff seems clueless at times and I was served the wrong dish. Was at the Punggol outlet at 10.15am. If you want duck.. I suggest you going to other places"

But it was worth the wait.Trolley and trolley of food will pass by your table and It can be intimidating to the uninitiated.Clueless about what to order, just point and ask, and the staff will answer the best they can. Surprise yourself and randomly choose what ever fancies your eye. If you have food allergies, make sure to ask whats inside as there are a number of food with shrimps and crab meat.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet ,negative,30,30-Nov-17,"This is my second time coming here for their Buffet. Food is still as good but I felt that the standard dropped a little. Their food portion became smaller. The maki we ordered used to have grilled cheese on top that made is taste so darn good but right now all they have is the just some sauce drizzled on top of it. Also the yaki tori gizzard that we ordered were so small. It was cut into very tiny pieces unlike before where it’s was much bigger. On a side note, the store fried beef was really good. You have to try that one. Our overall experience was good although our orders took some time to come. Food and service was good. Would give it a 3.5 rating if I could. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good crab, but quite pricey",positive,40,11/19/17,"Service was really good! The food was good as well, but quite overpriced in my opinion. Worth a visit when you’re in Singapore."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",This Muthu's can be a bit muted,negative,30,20-Nov-16,"Purists complain that Muthu's fish head curry is no longer the best in Singapore as it once was - we think it's still pretty good - tangy, piquant, with a nice red colour. Other dishes are so-so, served in tiny portions. This branch is clean...More"
French,Saveur,Good value for money,positive,40,15-Oct-17,Food quality is good and the set menu is really value for money. Serving is generous (my friends and I were actually full from the appetisers). Service is decent. Good place for a gathering with friends.
French,Paul,Great sweets,positive,40,11-Jul-15,The macaron and the chocolate tart were good. Will definitely go back to try some of the other things next time!
French,Paul,Terrible service and ordinary food at Paragon outlet ,negative,20,22-Sep-16,"This review is for the outlet at Paragon mall, which is not in TripAdvisor. Terrible service, we ordered an omelette and a cold sandwich when we arrived and amazingly, the omelette arrived first. I even had the time to eat it before the sandwich arrived, and that was very bland and fairly ordinary. Otoh, the fresh lemonade is really sour and refreshing.The waiting staff are pretty useless and various patrons were constantly having to wave them to their tables to correct mistakes with their orders. Will definitely avoid."
French,Paul,Lunch,positive,40,16-May-17,"Roast Rack of lamb , well cooked , tastes good, 3 pieces , just right for light lunch. Cappuccino with dash of hazelnut sauce was fragrant and slightly sweet."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",not impressed,positive,40,5-Apr-16,"Shin Minori Restaurant what could I say, my first encounter not impressed with this establishment and I could honestly say that I had much better Japanese food elsewhere. Ordering thru a Samsung tablet which is neither friendly nor instinctive placed the restaurant on the cheap eat scale .Staff seemed pleasant and friendly and attentive. Frankly, the food lacked variety, and the quality of food was average with a run-of-the-mill taste. Certainly not worth the price charged. Very dissatisfied, I would not rush for a second return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good hawker food stalls,positive,40,19-Jan-17,"A quality hawker centre with plenty of variety that is close to Orchard Rd. You can get into a queue with the locals or find something yourself. Plenty of seating with fans and stalls with cold drinks and beer. Dishes with duck, chicken rice, Indian, satay's etc available. All priced around $4-5 SGD. Great value."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Really disappointing,negative,10,15-Feb-18,"Was really disappointed with this place. I booked one week in advance for valentines day via Facebook. The restaurant confirmed with me and i even followed up on the day to reconfirn, When I arrived there was no booking under my name and we were ushered to the end of a 6 seater table layout with them pulling the table at the end out slightly. We asked to be moved. The steak and fries. Probably the worst version of French steak and fries I have ever had. Fries tasted like they had been dripped in fat and someone had clearly gone a bit heavy with the lemon mixed in the sauce that covered the steak.We were given a complimentary drink once we had to asked to move and explained this was supposed to be a valentines day booking (albeit no record of it at the front desk).This restaurant claims to be one of the most romantic in Singapore hence the Valentine day booking. Apart from the decor and Duxton Hill settings, not sure how they can claim this magical status."
French,Paul,"Food is good, service is horrible",negative,30,20-Jan-16,All of our dishes came at different times and one was completely forgotten. Not pleasant to have everyone eat at different times!! Couldnt get anyone's attention for a long time. Definetely not a pleasant experience. Sad because the food was good. Service leaves a lot to be desired.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast service but average food-wise,negative,30,25-Jul-17,"Service was extremely fast and servings were small, which was good as you can try as many food items as possible. However, apart from the fresh sashimi, the other food items were only average tasting in my opinion. Buffet does not come with complimentary water nor desserts"

French,Angelina_MBS,Okay... Only.,negative,20,21-Jan-16,We had their signature 3-course set menu. Tried the famous hot choco and famous mont blanc- not really good. Just so so. I prefer the Au Chocolat French Bistro at Marina Bay Sands last time. Way better than their menu.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great food. Great atmosphere. Great entertainment,positive,50,27-Sep-14,"Had a wonderful relaxing Thursday evening lapping up simple yet delicious sushi. The best I've had in Singapore. Ishizawa-San brought out the best in every piece and every bite. He is serious about his craft and relaxed with his guests. Service and attention to detail is excellent as always. There was a celebration that day and the 3 chefs donned on bunny ears and massive clown sunglasses for a surprised rendition of happy birthday. All in all, an amazing night out."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Value Japanese Buffet,positive,40,28-Jun-16,"Wide range menu to choose from, Sashimi, sushi, handrolls, tempura, soups, pan fried, grilled items etc The sashimi platter had lovely slices of salmon belly, which I enjoyed. The garlic fried rice and cod roe spaghetti was superb! We presented the promo voucher and the restaurant gave us a big serving of Alaska snow crab nabe. It was delicious and fresh! Looking forward to going back to celebrate my birthday in August! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Destined to be SHINJI,positive,50,22-Jan-13,"We attempted to charm our way into Shinji Raffles without a reservation.No way----downhearted and hungry we had no idea where to go.Suddenly, an angel appeared (I will call her J) and said, ""follow me...."".We found ourselves at SHINJI OUE TOWER where we enjoyed the finest sushi the four of us have EVER had!!!!Chef Kikuchi is an artist. The fish is so fresh and delicious ---the preparation creative and artistic.We are world travelers and dine in the finest restaurants----this is one of them!!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive for a hawker center,negative,10,18-Sep-12,Overly priced just because it is a famous tourist spot. Total rip off for very very average food. Most hawker centers in singapore have better food and way cheaper.
French,Poulet,Love the roast chicken!,positive,40,26-Dec-13,"It's been a while since I ate at this place.... So perhaps my review's abit outdated?I went to the outlet at Bugis + in 2012 and then the one in Great World City early this year 2013...I really love the roast chicken.... Both times, the roast chicken was done just right... very tender and juicy yet the skin is crispy... I also had the escargots and loved them...We tried the tiramisu the 2nd time we went and was delighted with it.... Recently, it seems that everywhere I go, I can see Poulet... At the rate it's popping up everywhere, I hope the quality of the food will not drop... For the not so cheap pricing, the food better be good to justify it....I will review here again when I visit it the next time round..."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Expensive food and so-so beef,negative,30,23-Jan-17,"Had their famous steak and fries, only their sauce was amazing. Steak was so-so, too chewy and not tender enough. Fries overly fried, if not for their steak sauce, everything was boring. Won't be coming back again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner,negative,30,1-May-16,First time there and according to Yahoo information it is top 20 Japanese restaurant. I doubt it as the foods provided is just average. Don't have the WOW factor. It is located in UE Square and the place is quiet on weekend.The restaurant is full house. The food is order via tablet with picture indicating your selection. The serving is a bit slow as it depend the numbers of customer ordering it. The chef will prepare those with many orders. Kimchi i also being served in this Japanese restaurant.I don't think I will recommend people to patronize the outlet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fresh sashimi!,positive,50,22-Sep-17,"value for money fresh sashimi!

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Hard to find, easy to enjoy",positive,50,10/23/13,Look behind the stalls for the small sign and stairs leading up to Yum Cha. It is better than anything else in the neighborhood. We had the Dim Sum and were very pleased with the quality and quantity. As we sat there we could see other full dinner platters pass by to tables in other rooms that were having full meals. They looked wonderful. Except for the beer the prices were very good. Plan on just one beer or none at all. The tea is a very good alternative both for quality and price.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food & great service,positive,40,30-Mar-14,"As the one we know for years at Rue du Débarcadère in Paris, we found in Singapore the good traditional French food in a friendly ambiance. We enjoyed its traditional one meal which is steak with french fries. The paté de Campagne and the rillettes de canard have to be tried as well as the tarte Tatin and the île flottante."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Holiday Dinner with Family,positive,50,12/29/15,"Nice restaurant with good service and outstanding food. We booked a table for twelve and were pleased with the ambience, recommended dinner items from the waiter and relative value. We all shared thanks to the lazy susan a terrific dinner: - Cream of corn and crab soup x 4 - Pumpkin soup in a nice squash bowl x 2 - Hot and sour soup x 2 (spicy and flavorful) - Red grouper steamed in light soy sauce x 2 - Seafood fried rice - Fried noodles with seafood - Vegetables with garlic, ginger and scallops - Whole crispy roast chicken - Wagyu beef cubes with vegetables (and lychees ... a bit surprising there but good) - Shrimp with wasabi sauce (delicious)Again, everything tasted great and was presented well."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Amazing steak!,positive,40,15-Dec-15,"Ribeye steak medium rare was perfectly grilled. Portion is big. Well grilled, every bite has got flavour, meat was tender with good marbling of fat at the side.
Fries were home made and cut in-house, very tasty too."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Only for grab,positive,40,11/10/2012,"Can't really comment on any other dishes than the grab in black or white pepper sauce or with chilli but that has been my reason to re-visit the place for many times.Imported grab is quite expensive but since the visits have only been on special occasions, it has been worth the money.The service is propably not the most efficient and despite always reserving in before hand the reservations have been lost or not in particular section of the restaurant (on patio) but usually the confusion has been solved and the over all experience has been good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hot food cold beer,positive,40,25-Jun-17,"Always a great place to visit with friends for tasty food accompanied by jugs of ice cold tiger beer. Cheap, cheerful and tasty .. recommend giving it a go..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced and overrated ,negative,20,05/28/18,"After a number of recommendations, we went to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered 3 dumpling dishes, a roast pork dish, vegetables and drinks.I’ve had MUCH better food in Sydney for a much cheaper price in very much nicer surroundings. In fact, I’ve had way better dumplings at our Thursday night street markets.To add insult to an already poor meal, we ordered a glass of beer each that turned out to be $10.50. EACH!Even worse, we were given a bowl of peanuts (not requested) and a packaged wet wipe each (also not requested) and upon reading our payment receipt, found we were charged for these items. There were no napkins provided at the table.The decor is old and depressing and everything just looks and feels like the place has seen long gone, much better days. We’ve eaten at all kinds of street vendors throughout SE Asia, we’re definitely not picky, fussy customers but I can also say that we’ve enjoyed a $10 meal 100 times more than we enjoyed this.Don’t waste your time or money, we just wasted $90 so that we can save anyone reading this from wasting their money too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Open stalls with various selection of food,positive,40,26-Feb-13,"Good place to hanging out & try local delicacy. But be prepare of the hot, smokey, busy & noisy situation.I was pretty disturbed with all the stall staff which tried to promote their menu and sometime pushy. Try the sting-ray fish (I can't remember which stall), but I try two different stall & both taste good. I must be lucky.There's stall named Indian Palace which totally match to my taste. I always afraid to try Indian food because of the heavy spices & bad aftertaste. This one taste mild but so good & pretty authentic, it still leave a spice aftertaste, but not as bad as I thought."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place for North Indian Vegetarian Food !,positive,50,16-Mar-16,"This review is based on our second visit to this lovely restaurant. Last time we had Dahi Bhalla Chaat and Chole Bhature, which were EXCELLENT ! This time, we had Corn Malai Seekh Kabaabs, and Kayberi Kadjai Paneer with a Bread Basket. All the items were superb and mouth-watering, and we had a hearty meal. Another nice thing about them is their location, it is bang opposite Mustafa Center, so its very convenient before a round of grocery shopping to have a heart meal ! "

Everytime/whenever I wish to make order I have to go up the stairs to alert the waiter and waitress, they are not very attentive. Service actually quite bad."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Lunch,negative,30,5-Aug-18,Food comes in small quantities which was good so that you can try more varieties. However certain items with sauces were too savoury especially the teppanyakis
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fancy, Fancy, Fancy! Pricey, Pricey, Pricey! Despite, Excellent Food and Service!",positive,50,15-Jun-15,"If I had to give a quick sentence that describes my dining experience at Waku Ghin, it would be: It is like Benihana Hibachi restaurant but with better food and impeccable service. Yes, I know...comparing Asia's top restaurant to a Benihana is almost profane. The only qualities that they have in common are the sous chef cooking in front of a group of 6 people with a flattop grill, and they both serve ""Japanese"" food (the quotes pertain to Benihana).Anywho, Waku Ghin was a delightful experience, from beginning to end. The wait staff was extremely attentive. Some people might be annoyed with that; however, with the money that you're paying for this meal, you almost expect the staff to give you a back rub or even spoon feed you your dinner (jokes). There was a moment where I dropped my napkin AND my chopsticks back-to-back (due to the consumption of a half a bottle of vino). Sure enough, the speedy waiters replaced both in a sec! The food? Amazing. One of the best meals that I've ever had. The sea urchin/shrimp/cavier was amazing. Both beef dishes (Tasmanian/Wagyu) were the simplest, most delicious meat dishes that I've had. The desserts? Yummy. The pastry chef made a special wild strawberry and lavender honey cream crumble for us. I made it clear to the waiter that I don't eat berries, except for strawberries. This was just in case they were going to serve a ""berry"" dessert. So, they brought out this special strawberry dessert for us. :) Everybody else got a luscious-looking chocolate dessert, which would have been excellent to try. Oh well! Overall, this dining experience was, truly, a unique one. And, yes, most reviewers griped how expensive it is. Yes, it is a pricey restaurant. Would I preferred to pay less for this meal? Of course!! However, the bottom line is that this is a top restaurant, ran by a very popular Japanese chef, located in a very expensive hotel/casino. I believe you get what you pay for. This kind of Japanese food is meant to be simplistic, adventurous, and opulent. My advice is to keep an open mind and enjoy the food. Smell every dish. Savor every bite. This ain't your local neighborhood's Benihana's! This is elegant food at its best."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Set meal Menu,positive,50,10/4/2016,Eat here as part of a group while away on a bussiness trip. We had a set meal which was superb can thouroghly recomend. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus has had its Day....Long ago!!,negative,20,13-Feb-17,"Visited Singapore in January 2017 and stayed at an AirBnB accommodation in Novena. Newton Circus Hawker market was about a 10-15min walk away and in the evening was a pleasant walk.On arrival at Newton Circus as you walk in there are signs which state ""No Touting"". From the minute we walked past that sign we were constantly harassed until we found somewhere to sit. The variety of food is not to bad but predominantly seafood but beef, chicken and pork are available if you look around. It is imperative that you confirm prices as they can suddenly change for an unsuspecting tourist. The Indian food was to die for but the rest was fairly plain and nondescript but the kids seem to like it and it was easy.The overall feel of Newton Circus was that it had had its heyday and it looked and felt old and well past its use by date and is need of a clean both in stalls and atmosphere. having spent 9 nights in Singapore we ate here twice and the second time was due to necessity and not by choice due to a long day at Legoland and the train stopped at this location. We ate at far better places including La Pau Sat and China Town."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Quite extraordinary - but pricey,positive,50,4-May-13,"Agree with Neil French on this one - the prices (minimum $350 per person) are indeed second-mortgage-inducing. But the food is extraordinary - tasting the sashimi and sushi at Shinji was the equivalent of opening - and consuming - an old, very good bottle of Bordeaux versus your standard table red. A new standard was created that won't easily be surpassed.Service was solid, good selection of wines and sake, no one tried to kick us out at the end even as our conversation extended into the wee hours. Incidentally, we had a sushi-hater with us at the table, who decided to go with the flow re the set menu, and thought it was amazing."

French,Paul,Lot of History but bad service,negative,20,23-Jan-16,"I was recommended very highly of this place but my experience was very different. They must choose the most unappealing staff and servers. Our server was very rigid with our requests. I mean you are going pay premium prices so you expect the waiters to be a little accommodating. Besides that, there was only 2 servers which made service very slow. The environment of the restarant and set up is very chic and European and the presentation of pastries, macaroons and pies at the counter is mouthwatering but that's where it ends. Food was average at best.It reminded me of a phrase I learnt many years ago. All that glitters is not gold."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good option for North Indian food,positive,40,2-Oct-16,Had been there recently during my stay in Singapore. One of the better North Indian restaurants in Little India.The chat items and Chole Bhature were good.I suppose it needs to improve on its North Indian dishes as the neighbouring Panchatantra is gonna give it run for its money...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Avg Jap Restaurant,negative,30,25-Jul-17,"Sashimi was really thick n fresh the first time, but far inferior in the subsequent round. Not properly defrosted, so the bite is not crunchy n fresh, but rather breaks apart n slightly mushy. The carbs are also quite badly done, turning dry n tough from the microwave reheating. The sushi n rolls are nice though."

The sashimi is really fresh though the location is a bit of a pain to get to from the MRT stations. Could be noisy at times, especially during dinner.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,negative,20,5-Mar-17,"Food was average or even some was below average.Waiting time for each of the items ordered were at least 30-45 minutes, excluding Sashimis which took 10-15mins for a plate.The waiting time was horrible and there were people around my table asking for their food too.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So so steak and poor hospitality,negative,20,6-Aug-17,"The taste of the steak was so so although it was nicely cooked according to our request. I am really disappointed with the super cramp space. The restaurant was actually empty but we were forced to sit at a table for two without no space to exit. The waiter refused to put us to a bigger table. When I asked why can't you push these tables so that we can have more space to get in and out our seat, the answer was simply ""this is our concept"". Then I replied...Oh it is your concept to torture your guest until we can't get out from our seat. If the restaurant was full, I would understand such refusal. However, it was very empty."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable Dim Sum in a pretty oriental ambience,positive,50,08/28/11,"Visited there with my husband and daughter for lunch on Sunday afternoon. Although the restraunt was crowded and were so many people waiting, we were so lucky to get the seat soon because we were only three people, while the others were large parties. We seated at a table beside window with a pretty view of lanterns, but the window itself adds a oriental spice to the room. Of course the food were good: as were shown in the pictures, they look nice as well. We rushed to Pekin Duck, and had nine dim sum and oolong tea. What surprised us was that the total price was 56 Singapore dollars!!! Definitely visit there again."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Will be back for more,positive,40,12-Jul-15,"Went there for a date with my girlfriend, ambience was very nice, very private. Place was very classy. Went to the outlet at Suntec City. We had the l'entrecote steak & fries, Caesar salad & escargots. Steak was cooked to the right doneness for me, but a little too rare for my girlfriend, fries was good and when it was last order we requested for more fries, they served it freshly cooked. Awesome, great service from the staff as well, recommended to visit, but not a fan of the escargots there. They probably should serve some bread first as the steaks took quite awhile. Thank god we had appetizers."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Great Breakfast!,positive,50,18-Aug-14,"Good and tasty vegetarian meal. Price was slightly on the high end for us (esp. after the conversion); the set breakfast meal was large and could be shared by 2 persons (if not hearty eaters). The restaurant does need a face lift, though."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Restaurant for chat items,positive,40,14-Apr-17,"Kailash Parbat is good north Indian restaurant but especially for chat items.Must try Chole Bhatture or bhattura Platter.They have lot good variety of Indian snacks and Chats.But Mumbai Chats such as Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav, Ragada pattice are average taste.Sometimes it is too crowded so go early.They have other branch on Serangoon road as well which serves similar items.Service is good but sometime with more crowd it deteriorates"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Awesome South Indian Fare,positive,40,20-Aug-13,"Awesome location - Opposite Mustafa Center.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So disappointing!,negative,20,21-Sep-13,"Really loved this place on previous visits. This time was such a let down. Firstly, they rushed us so that it felt as though we were in MacDonalds. We had barely sat down before we were hassled to order, and then the main course turned up before we had even started our salad. Clearly just wanted us out so they could get the next bill-payers in our seats! The steak was not great - which is supposed to be their selling point. Th house wine, which was pretty good and robust last time, has been changed and felt like a $50 rip off. Has the place changed management? Need to concentrate on quality rather than bums on seats or whill soon lose their reputation and customers. Sad!!!!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Impressive Indian food,positive,50,19-Apr-17,Kailash Parbat is located in front of Mustafa mall and it offers tasty Indian food at reasonable price. North Indian dishes were well prepared and tasted like food made in India.
French,Paul,Extremelty good service at the Tanglin Branch,positive,50,12-May-17,I really really loved the service staff at their Tanglin branch. All of them are unassuming and sincere. They don't judge what you order or what you do not order or if you request for free water. Wait staff at the marina bay link outlet are not friendly and pass judgmental look when you do not order drinks with the food

We had dinner buffet. The Crispy Karela (bitter gourd) Was deliciously awesome.
Good spread of vegetarian dishes. However the Peshawari halwa got over and they served normal halwa"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than expected!,positive,50,15-Jun-14,"Having tried Tetsuya's in Sydney, I knew that Waku Ghin would be nothing short of amazing, and after dining there last night, I can say that I was truly impressed with the food, service and the whole ""chef's table"" experience. It was so much better than I expected!Every dish that was placed in front of us, was cooked beautifully and presented like a work of art. Staff were attentive, but not overcrowding and all of them had a lot of knowledge about the ingredients used in the dishes. There is no denying that the price per head is costly! But what you get is a lovely 2-3 hour meal, delicious food and an amazing dining experience that Chef Tetsuya created himself."
French,L_Angelus,Top French style brasserie/restaurant,positive,50,25-Apr-17,"We had dinner with 5 people. The food was delicious. Could not fault anything. The foie gras was fantastic. Reasonable prices for the wines considering the import duties charged in Singapore. Only remark is that our waiter needs some more training.The Aperol Spitzer is good, very good. Highly recommend it"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very overpriced, no atmosphere and average food",negative,20,26-Dec-15,"Please do read all the reviews in the ""poor category"", they are spot on. We are a relatively young couple (early 30s) who go to these types of restaurants a couple of times a year. We can afford to go (not every week!) but we also expect a lot as they are a treat for us. If you meet this criteria then hopefully our review is helpful - please don't go here, it's a huge waste.Waku Ghin has to be the biggest disappointment we've ever experienced, and the most expensive (we spent twice what we spent at the fat duck, and it was a significantly less amazing experience).Do they do anything wrong? Not really but it's that they don't really do anything amazing and with this price tag, you really have to (for two people, it cost approx GBP 800 or around USD 1,500 - we had matched wines, also there was about $150 in tax and another $150 in service, added to the quoted prices). So here's what really didn't work for us:FOODThe menu is omakase, so the chef chooses the food. At no point were we given a menu of what was to come or emailed after, which was disappointing (even though the waiter said we would be). The chefs often announced the meals before they were served but their English was not great so often we had no idea - appreciate the benefits of having Japanese chefs but at these prices - and not being in Japan - we would expect there to be some way to convey what we were eating and some information about it. At points there were young female helpers who came over -not quite sure of their role other than occasionally to clarify what the chefs had said, but this certainly didn't happen for every course.The food itself was fine - our favourites were the oysters, sea urchin and abalone. The rest was fine but nothing special. To top it off my husband felt pretty unwell at the end of it.WINEIt seemed odd to be asked about wine straight away when we had no idea about what food we were being served (see above). We felt forced to do matched wines as they weren't forthcoming with information to allow us to pick a bottle and weren't particularly helpful (there didn't appear to be a sommelier to talk us through the options). Either way the bottles of wine were so expensive it actually seemed sensible to do the wine pairing at $250 per head - that gives you an idea about the cost of the wine list. Although three of the wines in the wine pairing were sake, so if you aren't a fan of sake then it's a bit of a waste. The other pairings were pretty good.SERVICEBoth the waiters and chefs seemed robotic and not actually interested in engaging with us, other than to serve the food and say what they needed to. You are seated in small rooms with a chef preparing the meals - we tried to engage but didn't really get anywhere and it was quite uninspiring (compared with Burnt Ends we had been to the day before which was great to watch).ATMOSPHEREUrgh. So dull. We were seated in a room with four other people. There is no ambience. I would say this vibe might work for older businessmen and that's about it. Certainly not for couples - not good for a special occasion. Just lacks any ambience.All in all, we would recommend avoiding Waku Ghin. Save yourself the money - this just isn't up there with the top restaurants. "

Chinese,London Fat Duck,For duck lovers only,positive,40,7/1/2015,"The roast ducks are indeed fat like its namesake and that's exactly what it has promised to offer and that's what I am here for. It's probably one of the few restaurants in Singapore which is serving free range ducks from Ireland. It's definitely above average - duck is juicy, flavorful and fat. I also tried the black pepper duck bun, which is quite delicious. I went at 5ish on a Saturday and was seated in 15-20mins. Will revisit if i am in the neighbourhood and if I dont have to wait for too long. And at $48 per duck, it's quite reasonably priced."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chaos in the crowds,negative,30,30-Jul-16,"We recently revisited this hawker centre on a trip to Singapore. Granted it was a Friday night but boy were we shocked with the crowds. We could not find a seat anywhere and spent twenty minutes looking for two seats. Once you find your seat, you can proceed to order your food. We had satay and I had to have the spicy stingray. My husband had nasi goring and it was all fine. I have to say the place was super busy and we waited longer than usual for our food. It was definitely an experience and was good to eat at this long standing Singaporean institution. I would recommend not going on a Friday night unless you are in early as it was crazy! It's also very cheap and I would also suggest pinning the seafood stalls down to a price before ordering. Some of them don't have menus with prices on them and I think this is a bit risky customers. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi ,positive,40,18-Oct-16,"Came here for the buffet lunch, sashimi as per mention are quite good. Portions they serve are bite size, good for couples dining."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointing.,negative,20,08/28/16,"Excellent service but very bland food and overpriced. The spring rolls tasted as if they were bought frozen from a supermarket. The Soy chicken was a very small serving and tasted like it was simply poached in water with no sauce, flavour or seasoning to speak of. The pork collar in xo sauce had no punch at all. We also requested tap water but was presented with 3 bottles of water over the course of the meal valued @ $10 each which was only realised when paying the bill. Very disappointing overall. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",24 hours of tasty fun,positive,50,17-Jan-13,"Ananda Bhavan does all sorts of food, but really they should stick to their great South Indian dishes. Great dosa and rava dosa; not so great (to my taste) set meals, but I keep going back."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent food with friendly staff,positive,50,11/27/16,Went to this restaurant for my Mum's birthday lunch on 25th November 2016. The food was really really good and the price was reasonable. Restaurant Manager Alden Gan was in charge of our sector; he and his staff were very friendly and made the dining experience a pleasant one.We really enjoyed the lunch and will definitely return to this restaurant for more chinese cuisine.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was good but food was disappointing,negative,20,7/7/2017,"Visited this place today for their dim sum.. was disappointed as it doesn't taste nice maybe not up to my expectation. The texture and overall was kinda bad.. I read some of the review saying the ha gao and siew mai was nice but it really is not, except of the prawn filling which was fresh. I didn't try the rest of dishes though, maybe will visit another time for the dishes but never coming back for the dim sum."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor seats allocation,negative,20,9-Jun-16,"Well we booked a table for 2 pax through Chope but they did not receive the booking. When we got there, the restaurant was pretty empty and when we saw the table the waiter was bringing us, which was next to a wall and a table top acting as a partition from the next table; the neighbouring table was just right next to us.We asked if we can have another table near the windows to have a bit more privacy. The waiter said they were reserved. Throughout the whole night, nobody came for those tables. I just thought that since its a quiet Wednesday, the waiter should have given us a better table instead of lying to us that those table were reserved."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi and sashimi like in Japan,positive,50,19-Aug-11,"We had an amazing lunch on the restaurant's first anniversary. The sushi and sashimi were absolutely stunning. Same quality as in Tokyo, only slightly less expensive. Perfect service. I'll go back when next in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese 1 for 1 Buffet,positive,40,28-Nov-16,The location is somewhat out of the way from MRT but not to difficult to find. Speed of serving is good but there was order that was made first and yet not delivered after second order. Quality wise OK. Overall good value for money especially with a 1 for 1 offer.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special dining experience,positive,50,9-Apr-13,"Eating at Waku Ghin was truly a memorable evening for me and my wife. Firstly, this was a meal to celebrate our marriage just a few days ago. Also Tetsuya is my culinary idol (unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to meet him as he has never been at his restaurants each time I have dined) and we were going to Singapore as a stopover on our honeymoon, so Waku Ghin was a perfect excuse to splurge on a mind blowing meal.The service here is top notch, you get your own private chef, and the food is absolutely amazing (as the restaurant sources only the finest ingredients in the world). Truly one of the best meals I have ever had! For detailed review of Waku Ghin, please see the following link:http://foodmab.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/waku-ghin-singapore-15-june-2011.html"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Indugle in the Best,positive,50,4-Mar-14,"It was for a very special dinner celebration and we have decided to choose a very restaurant to indulge and Waku Gin was our first choice and the right choice ! This is one of those spectacular restaurant that is special from the decor to the food , the service and the presentation of each dish, every aspect was perfection. As it was our first visit, we got the manager to recommend a menu for us and each dish was well recommended as they were sublime and each of these dishes went so well with the next one. The presentation of the dishes was creative, the flavours were beautiful and the ingredients were special, fresh and of top quality. Yes, it was indulgence in every sense and $$$ but it was totally worth it ! We look forward to our next visit here again. Great experience !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,worth-going for crab fans!,positive,40,06/28/17,"this was one of the best crab place in Singapore.we visited the place for dinner at 8:30pm, but was told big size crabs were all gone. I strongly suggested those looking for big crabs to call and reserve crabs in advance.We ended up ordering 2 small ones (each $55), trying pepper ad chili taste.The pepper one was great but it was less spicy than expected. much appreciated the smell and taste of the dish.The chili one was nice too, but the sauce was slightly more spicy than the other crab restaurant's recipe.service was good and attentive.we were offered aprons and help on cracking the shell when it was a bit difficult to crack the thick shell. Tho the kitchen did cracked on the shell to prepare it for eating before serving (a nice gesture).in terms of price, this place may be slightly more expensive, in a 10% range, comparing to other crab place.but the decent seating environment and the service were all well-justified."

Reservation is a must if you do not want to waste time waiting for a table. The restaurant was full on that day.As the portion was not big, each of us ordered a main course and some sides to share.We tried the grilled octopus, crab risotto, creamy pork, duck tortellini and tiramisu (the pistachio panna cotta was already sold out at 7pm!!). We enjoyed and liked all of them.Service was prompt and good. If you like simple restaurant with good food, this is the place."

The Ambiance of the restaurant was excellent.. was very clean.. the Staff was good.. service was good.. but Slow.. Should try Chole Bhature Platter..

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply Amazing Experience,positive,50,30-Jul-16,"With the recent Michelin star introduction in Singapore, this is the 1st restaurant with a Michelin star that i visited. I went to another Michelin star restaurant the next day and by comparison, food is so much fresher and delicious, ambiance is quiet yet cosy, and the attentiveness of the chef and waitresses were a class up.There are 3 dinner sets to choose from $220 to $450. I had the $300 Omakase Wa. It was the most filling and satisfying Japanese dinner in Singapore.The set consists of appetiser, assorted sashimi, assorted cooked dishes, nigiri sushi and maki sushi, Soup and Japanese fruits. All the seafood were of course as fresh as it gets. The chef was skillful in his craft and my friend and I had the chef to ourselves till middle of our meal when a couple came in. I guess the chef made most of the experience in this restaurant memorable. A small portion of the jelly dropped on the table. After i finished the whole jelly, he took a piece of tissue, leaned forward, said a word of sorry, and cleaned off the jelly on my table. Most people would think the chef's main role is to make good food but in this fine restaurant, the effort and attentiveness of the chef was amazing."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tasty pepper crab,positive,40,10/9/2013,"The food is somewhat better than the other chinese places, I've been to. Nice pepper crab, tasty tofu and shiitake... No great lover of chinese food, but this was ok. Service is acceptable, but by no means accomodating. Entrance is in the bach of a store. Look out!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, excellent seating area & open past 10 pm",positive,50,30-Mar-14,"We ate at Maxwell in Chinatown, Tekka in Little lndia, but Newton was my favouite. The eating area is larger, there were sinks for washing your hands and so much variety. We had excellent Indian food, Malay, Chinese soup and juices (we were a group of 7). Luckily it was also still hopping when we arrived at 10 pm from our transfer from Malaysia. Strongly recommended. "
French,Paul,"Grand European cafe style, great for a light lunch",positive,40,27-Mar-14,"This is a nice grand cafe style restaurant which is quite different to the Paul style in Europe. The location is impeccable and the restaurant nicely decorated, light and airy. There were many staff and service was prompt if a little curt. The food was as expected, simple, fresh and nicely served. As always the bread and pastries are a particular strength of Paul and this Singapore incarnation is no exception. Great for a simple lunch in above average surroundings. Quite pricy but not much above the norm for this quarter of Singapore's shopping district."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh and nice food,negative,30,26-Jun-18,Food served quite slow. Preferred a detachable iPad menu so to let other diners in the group can place their orders. Sad part was dessert is not included in the buffet.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Ok food and service, lousy beer lady",negative,30,04/21/15,"We had 3 tables of 10 and ordered a set dinner. The giant clams, pepper crabs and roast chicken were good. Fish, fried rice and mango dessert were ok. Service is mostly fine too. Like some restaurants and coffee shops, the beer is outsourced to a 3rd party and you have these grouchy ladies hawking and serving beer. Near the end of our dinner we stopped the flow of beer which kept coming, since these ladies probably earn commission. Despite our stop instructions , they kept giving us jugs of beer and refused to take them back. Rather annoying. Before we got the bill, we had to speak to the manager to cancel the untouched jugs"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding!,positive,50,13-Sep-16,"My husband and I were celebrating a special occasion and decided on Shinji @ Raffles Hotel for lunch at the sushi counter on a Saturday in September and were not disappointed. We have previously dined at several Michelin star restaurants in Japan, and were keen to try Shinji. We ordered the 12 piece sushi course. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi and sashimi and thought it was first class. The fish melted in the mouth and the rice was served at room temperature. Although wasabi was available, we followed the chef's lead and didn't add any more to our plates. The 12 piece course was sufficient for us. Attentive service in filling our drinks when required (we had champagne). We brought our 11 month old daughter and the staff were courteous and friendly to her too. She didn't eat but enjoyed the experience and attention from the friendly wait staff. While not a fault of the restaurant, I was surprised to see and felt a bit disappointed for the chef and staff that a fellow diner (who was by himself) was dressed very casually in shorts and t-shirt and ate entire meal with head phones on and looking at his phone. All in all, a wonderful experience and would eat here again for a special occasion!"
French,Paul,How on earth can this legacy have excellent ratings.!!!!,negative,10,31-Aug-18,"Ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea for S$6,50 good for 1 pax for 2 cups at the Paragon Orchard outlet. Pot of hot water came separately from Paul depuis branded tea bag. No instructions on infusion timing. Soak for 15mins still far from plain water with some yellow colouring. Tasteless of course as tea dust bag is so small with this almost 500ml of water. S$6.50 for a pot of tea maybe a budget for this most expensive city in the world but not an acceptable standard for a legacy restaurant like Paul depuis."

It was too oily. So next visit I specifically asked for less oil in my rice. I was in for a shock, the most oiliest biryani I have ever had. Did point it out to the lady in charge, who defended it saying there was no extra oil added. We already had a tiring day, was in no mood to argue with someone who was not ready to correct. We just left the food , paid the bill and exited. The manchurian starter was over fried. Will never step in there again as they lack basic customer service."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome black pepper crab,positive,40,10/27/16,"Three of us ordered 1.2kg black pepper crab, kailan veg with garlic, deep fried calamari, and cereal prawns. All the dishes were very good with the crab being awesome. I recommend to get a plate of buns (fried or steamed) and ask the waiters to bring some extra Chili Crab sauce for 'dipping'. The black proper crab is a little more spicy and assertive on your tongue, whereas the chili crab is a little sweeter - I prefer the former. The meal came to about SGD $220 which is reasonable given the items. Be wary of them pushing their set menu which is a lot of food for about $120-130/head. Overall, one of the best crab spots in Singapore. The Dempsey area is great with lots of other dining and beverage options. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,thrilling.,positive,40,06/24/14,"Nice place, quite hard to find, lost in the middle of the shops. But very goog food, decent and precise service. The dim sums are creative and awake curiosity and awoke my tatse buds very nicely. Spice is present but not invading."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is ok but not for something else,negative,30,15-Apr-14,"I have a dinner at L'Entrecote today.I ordered medium rare and agree that their streak is good. But the bad part is their appetiser and desert. I had leek and vinaigrette. It was good if I went to some friend who might be just start cooking. The leek was very hard and sticky, not anywhere near tender. The vinaigrette was added with chopped shallots. Too sour and not tasty. The desert I ordered lava cake which was put on the menu is desert of the house. The cake is almost like rubber and inside lava have a rock solid of un-melted caramel. Service is average.Unimpressed !All-in-all. Steak is good but don't think about something else."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab de luxe,positive,40,04/17/14,"Local expat recommended this place, and it is absolutely worth it! We did not have a reservation, but got a table by ourselves on a separate terrace, and still decent service. We had the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab and plenty of beer. Great taste and great fun. Kids played around us and the night was great. Bring your own napkins!!!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Home made steak experience,positive,50,29-Jan-18,Great ambience and excellent food. Kept simple with the fact that you only order steak and fries. Just pick the appetizers if needed. Desserts were great. Highly recommend the caramel lava cake.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori dinner,negative,20,16-Oct-18,"Unfortunately we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive for every order we made, and halfway through, the wifi broke, so no one could order through the automated system. They could not cook fast enough for a full house."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea foods ,positive,40,07/24/16,"Thinking about seafoods at good restaurant at weekend in Singapore without a prior booking, forget it as there's always a long que at fully booked ones! I was lucky to have one table for at this rest. one week ago. The geo duck was fresh and great for shasimi, the black peper crab is the specility of the chain since its early day and still keeping to its fame! Tip is that you should book a few days ahead for weeken to get an indoor table and order everything you want from begining or wait for quite a time as it's too crowded! Overall it's worth the price!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese in Singapore - complete dining experience!,positive,50,15-Feb-12,"This has got to be my favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore!I have eaten there about 5 times in 2011 (3 times for lunch, twice for dinner) and have never been disappointed - the service and quality of the food is always consistently mind-blowing.Run jointly by Joni Ong & Oishi-san, hospitality is at its very best, with Oishi-san's Japanese take on hospitality and Joni's candid, unaffected & warm demeanour.My family and I have always felt very much welcome there.Counter seating - and usually packed over lunch hours - be sure to make a reservation in advance! Some would complain of the lack of privacy since it's a rather communal seating arrangement, but I myself have found it to be quite an experience in itself, and extremely authentic. :)If it's your first time there, be sure to1. Make a reservation2. Ask for Oishi-san to serve you3. Opt for the basic set for lunch (I always go for the 9 pc set, being petite and constantly on a diet, I can barely finish the 7th piece - or the slightly more premium one, when my paycheck's come in)4. Make sure you have 2-3 hours, with someone you deeply care about so you can slowly enjoy each dish, banter with the sushi chef and drink some sake with your loved one.The sushi melts in your mouth, is so fresh you half expect the fish slices to perform a little musical and dance around on its rice ball. <3<3<3 worth every penny. (even though it's a hell of a lot of pennies you're paying!)For lunch I tend to get away with paying $150-200 per head while for dinner it's about $350-400 with Sake, per head."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese seafood restaurant,positive,40,2/4/2015,"They have package menu which we took for 5 pax. Cost slight above S$300++ and what we got was prawns, steamed tilapia, roast chicken, a mushroom & veggie dish (i thought this was really good) in some white broth, 2 large chilli crabs with fried mantou, a plate of fried rice and a bowl of yam like dessert. Had a pretty enjoyable meal but would expect a better fish than a Tilapia which they gave us an option to upgrade it to a promfret at a price. We declined so didn't find out how much. Not sure if this is a reasonable price in Singapore but coming from across the border, I thought it was pretty expensive,"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",As Good as the one in Ginza,positive,50,29-Aug-13,"We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and the same bunch of us had visited his outlet in Ginza a few months back. There is no way we could tell the difference between the two due to the excellent sake recommended by Kanesaka-san. If you are a sushi fan you won't be disappointed."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice staff, but the food disappoints a bit",negative,30,12-Jun-16,"We had entrecote, the only main dish on offer, which is all you need, if you have a craving for steak frites. Unfortunately, it didn't measure up - at least not to our taste. The ambience is great, the staff is nice and attentive and the wine list was good. Perhaps worth a try for those reasons, but there are better places to found. PS for those who like chocolate, their mousse is really, really good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best hawker center,positive,50,12-Oct-17,This is the best hawker center on singapore. On advice i went to two other hawker centers and was sadly disappointed. Newton is definitely has the best to offer. Its very clean and has excellent stalls to choose from. Number 31 heng heng bbq has excellent food.
French,Paul,Birthday disaster,negative,10,22-Sep-17,"Everything just went wrong. From the first start we ordered bottle water instead it was warm water, and the waiter just put it at the corner of the table and hoping we were the one who will distribute to everyone. Until one of my friend ask her to distribute the water. And the food are taking so much time, for only salads it took over than 45 minutes to come. The same goes for the drink, and also a birthday cake that never come out. The food tasteless The waiters look confused and unprofessional, maybe they don't have a proper training.. will be my first and last time coming here."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chope Telephone Reservation,negative,30,8-Jan-17,"The reservation is good but the incessant telephone call through Viber and telephone call is very irritating. After confirming the reservation, the system keeps calling you despite confirming it a few times. It will keep calling until you answer and even is you answer and confirm it, it still keep calling. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding sushi,positive,50,29-Apr-15,"Singapore has plenty of Japanese restaurants right from the chains such as Sushi Tei to the celebrity chefs. Shinji falls in the highest category when it comes to Omakase restaurants in Singapore, it is located in the colonial Raffles Hotel and is set up in traditional Japanese style with tables by the sushi counter and then some private rooms. They have 3 or 4 set menus that one can choose from, most have a similar base of dishes with some add-ons. The chef asked us whether we wanted a selection of sashimi and sushi or just sushi. We opted for a combination and were fed a variety of wonderfully fresh fish. We were treated to yellow fin tuna, needle fish, sea urchins in sashimi and then blue-fin tuna, spanish mackerel and horse mackerel. All flown in that morning from Japan. They did serve a few non-fish dishes which too were fantastic. For desserts we were served the musk melon with salted ice-cream. And that was a fantastic end to a great meal. All along, the service was great. Do note, as with most high end Japanese restaurants, this one too charges top dollar and is usually frequented for business dinners or special occasions."
French,L_Angelus,A delightful French restaurant,positive,40,10-Apr-14,Dining in Singapore can often be a bland formulaic driven experience with restaurateurs driven by a desire to “produce” a cuisine and experience with matching designer driven décor and furniture. Not here. The food and wine shows a real level of care and is drawn from more than one French department. The manager was an informed and helpful sommelier with considered and constructive advice including good selections that matched our chosen desserts perfectly. He also checked on the service and food we received several times. I will return.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good social eating,positive,50,25-Jan-16,"Dress down, chill out, dining with a beer!! Based around a set courtyard with vendors serving diners in reach of their cabin. This place is 24 hours and is also respected for its cleanliness - Worth the cab ride!"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dimsum Heaven,positive,50,02/15/15,"I travel for Dimsum and have loved other dimsum such as the one in NYC China Town and SF's China Town. I can compare their siomai (pork and shrimp) texture, flavor to both. Its so good we order quite a bit of it. You can't go wrong. Eat with your eyes and then try everything!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SUSHI EXPERIENCE,positive,50,25-Nov-15,"This is very classic, simple, absolutely delicious sushi. No mayonnaise based sauces here. At times the sushi master studied the piece of fish looking for the exact way to cut it (this was not a show) and precises placed droplets of soy or juice to the exact spot on the fish."
French,Paul,Paul's @ Nee Ann City,negative,30,1-Apr-13,French Patisserie with lousy coffee - again - my beef with restaurants using UHT milk - what's up with that?

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The BEST on our 12-Michelin Star Trip!,positive,50,17-May-17,"We are foodies and just completed a trip to Singapore and HongKong with a combined 12 Michelin stars. Waku Ghin for us was the most pleasing experience overall - and we had a lot of fun on our trip! What was so outstanding about it?- it's like having a personal chef prepare your meal right in front of you, interact with you, and explain interesting tidbits - outstanding dishes!! I agree with the other TA reviews - the Uni, Shrimp, and Caviar (lots of Caviar) signature dish just blows the taste buds into heaven! The abalone was just amazing (and I am not usually a fan);- Sake & wine pairing; we are picky with our wines after some other eateries' tasting menus we're trying to be too smart by half; but the sommelier perfectly adjusted the wine selection and we tried 3 deep Sake tastes; and 3 wines plus champagne. Generous portions. Well paired!!- a huge amount of food AND Sake/wine ... actually it was too much food quantity for my spouse, and left even me trying to find more space in my stomach- a serene interplay between the bar, culinary, experience, and architecture. They really thought this through. The one downer: when leaving after a fabulously satisfying evening, the door of Waku Ghin lets you out on a balcony overlooking a gigantic casino - that was an unfortunate counterpointAll in all, Waku Ghin beat out other, more highly rated establishments in our experience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A Pleasant Surprise,positive,40,09/23/14,The food was great as always but what was surprising was the exceptional service . We were not looking forward to this meal as the last time we were here the service was horrendous . Something must have happened bec the service was faultless. Water n tea glasses were topped up without having to ask for it . Plates were changed between courses. They even offered to peel the crab shells for us ! What a breath of fresh service air !! Well Done Long Beach !!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Distinctive Japanese cuisine,positive,50,19-Jun-18,"Shinji by Kanesaka. Located at Lobby floor, Carlton Hotel, 76 Bras Basah Road, Singapore.The gateway of a wonderful marriage of distinctive Japanese cuisine serving a tantalising collection of dishes that will cater to every palate. Personal chef of the day will personally attend to about 8 diners, preparing busy at work master of sushi he expertly sliced out the fish, put on the sushi rice and finally, potter on the delicate seasonings, creating a very unique flavours. All the sushi I had tasted are very fresh and do not have even a hint of fishy smell, yet retaining the sweet, unique flavour of each own fish. The service is absolutely excellent, warm, friendly and genuine. One of the best services I had encountered. The place is unsophisticated, yet elegant, full of the Zen inspiration, filling one with tranquillity. I love this place I'll definitely be back!"

The spread of items were quite extensive from sashimi to grill to some dishes.I enjoyed the salmon sashimi, pumpkin chawamushi and garlic fried rice the most.I found the pumpkin chawamushi very interesting which felt like a fusion of Western and Japanese cuisine.Service was good but could have been better.

French,Paul,Up to Expectation,positive,40,21-May-12,"I have always been a fan of Paul in Paris. The one in Singapore has lived up to my expectation although the food seems priced compared to those in Paris. While the Paul in Paris is a common bakery, the Singapore one looks too posh for the common people. The food is just as good. Overall, I am contented that Paul finds its way to this Southeast Asian ""little red dot""."
French,Paul,Good food. Average service. ,positive,40,12-Jul-14,"But good ambience. Nice location for shoppers or business people. During peak hours be prepared to queue. Queue will move slowly as food does not come out of Kitchen quick enough and service is slow. Once they even forgot our order. But when the food did arrive. It was like wow. Great cod. My boss eats elegant foods and he enjoyed it. I've been here about 5times in 2 yrs and enjoyed the food every time. I also learned that in restaurant service in general is average and I do not expect too much. This way you can still enjoy your visit, the food and just nudge your server to do a good job. I will visit Paul's at Ngee Ann City soon. "

Food cooked very well, not just the seafood but the other meat/vegetable dishes as well (which is a good test of the overall quality of the kitchen).

Loved how they were served in the order we had ticked them on the menu so we knew exactly what we were eating. We would have loved to return, but the crowds preparing for Chinese New Year prevented us from reaching it again. BTW there is now a lift as well as the wooden staircase that used to be the only entry.we were lucky not to have to wait when we arrived......there was a huge queue as we left.

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Deliciously affordable steak,positive,40,9-Aug-17,"Eating steaks can be an expensive business, but you needn’t spend big money to eat good ones.Although not cheap-as-chips, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is a quaint little French restaurant at Robertson Quay. Although I had a placed a reservation, the table I was allocated was in a twilight zone spot of the restaurant….partially inside and partially outside the restaurant. I ended up being moved to three different tables that one evening. That would have, on a normal night, spoiled my mood and appetite but the restaurant manager – Valentine, was absolutely gracious throughout and did his best to ensure we have a good experience.Now about the food…you can demolish either the grilled rib eye steak with “vigneron” butter or grilled sirloin steak with herbs, both served with Mixed Salad & Free Flow of Home Made French Fries. Either one and you will end the evening feeling pretty damn satisfied.I need to tell you about the fries. They are cooked in duck fat. Duck, fat and fries are three words that please most people. Combining them is a very beautiful thing. There’s no looking back once you have tried these brown and crispy fries.While not quite as revelatory as the hype might suggest, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche certainly dishes out good steaks. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"

That was embarrassing and appalling on so many counts. Firstly, he could have asked his fellow staff first before shouting so loudly for everyone to hear, making it seem like we were evading our bill. Secondly, he could have come out to ask us face to face instead of shouting if he had wanted to clarify with us. Food wise, some were good some were average. Wide variety for the buffet, ranges from sushi to soba to rice and more. Service was generally ok and efficient enough. The restaurant uses a tablet for buffet ordering. Was going to give an Average rating until that appalling experience. "

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting experience,positive,50,20-Nov-11,"There's so much to say - where do I even start? The whole dinner was a very interesting (and positive) experience indeed.We booked a degustation (priced at S$500 per pax) for two. The hosts were impeccably polite and polished. We were led to a teppanyaki-styled dining area which seats about 6 pax. The ambience was nice and cozy, with nice marble table-tops.As it was a degustation menu, it was pretty much ""fixed"". However, the chefs were attentive and checked if there was anything which we would like to them replace (i.e some diners may not want beef due to dietary retrictions). The food was exquisite, concocted from the very best and freshest ingredients sourced the world over, e.g botan ebi, abalone, sea urchins, wagyu beef, etc. The presentation was refined and reflected a fusion of Japanese and Western cuision, which underscores the style of each dish. The best dish was the finely sliced Wagyu beef served with freshly ground Wasabi, which definitely left us wanting more!Some of the dishes on the menu were prepared in front of you, where the Chef would cook it on the teppan, to your preference and liking. While the Chef did not demonstrate knife-juggling skills as you would expect in a normal teppan restaurant, he took great care in explaining each dish and how it is best eaten. This made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.The desert was served in a separate room, overlooking Marina Bay. We were treated to an unexpected firework display over the bay, as there were some ongoing celebrations. The Ghin cheesecake, which is their signature dish, was simply yummy! In addition, you could choose up to 4 different kinds of petit fours, all of which were delightfully good. Would definitely visit again, when they have a new seasonal menu."

$24.25 (inclusive of 7% vat & 10% service charge) each.
Food was good. I love the freshly baked naan and their papad not so salty (very good to take while drinking)....More"
French,Paul,Excellent breakfast,positive,40,19-Aug-12,"I moved from France to the UK and then to Singapore. Singapore has a lot of western food out there to not forget your home country. Paul Bakery (which used to also be in Edinburgh, Scotland) is to me a very good place, where you can enjoy some really good pastries. I go almost every weekend for breakfast, where I order usually a Grand creme with a basket (croissant, pain au chocolate, half a baguette tradition and a briochette). My wife prefers savory food such as eggs, or salads. The pain au raisin (escargots) are fantastic. My daughter loves the macaroons. Fresh juice are also greatIt's a great bakery, where I am always looking forward to go.Having said that, I think there are some limitations, such as the bread choices. Bread is an old type so-called tradition which is harder to eat, because tougher and heavier. Then there is no choice between butter ie salted/unsalted. The fruit juices are sometimes too much loaded with water/ice. The portion are not consistent between the tables. The prices are rather high, but in line with western prices for a value for money ratio. More specifically to the Ngee Ann City's Paul, one of the major drawback is the queue to get in, the turnaround of the tables (some tables remains available but are not given) and the service can lack of efficiency.Anyway, I would recommend this place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ikan bakar,positive,40,27-Mar-13,"hot and spices Ikan Bakar and lala, I like. too many variety sometime don't know what to eat, but is a nice place to go.Why Singapore Seafood so expensive...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",You pay for what you get.. ,negative,30,11-Nov-17,"For the affordable prices, you get average quality food and below average service levels.
Also, the place looks like it needs a revamp badly.
Not a place for serious lovers of Japanese cuisine.. read connoisseurs."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steak, but nothing else",negative,30,3-Jul-15,"The steak is what they are famous for, and they can do that well and for a decent price ($38). However, the fries are below par, with perhaps only one slightly crispy chip out of 10. Entrées are average. Stay away from the house wine ($12), which is really not potable. Average service.There are more vibrant places in Singapore where you can have a good steak, and accompany that with decent entrées and wine."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love this location -- delicious food,positive,50,04/18/17,"I love love love the food here. I used to come here when I was a student studying abroad in Singapore in 2009. I just returned for a trip with my husband and friends and was delighted to see (and taste) that the quality of the food remained the same. Great for large groups! Try the Singapore chili crab (make sure to get the bread to dip in the sauce) and the white pepper crab. If your group is large enough, order the garlic mussels and the black pepper crab as well. It's a short distance from the downtown area, but it's easy to get to with a cab or Uber. Highly recommend!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good seafood and hawker centre,positive,40,5-Dec-14,Good seafood and close to my hotel. Price is a bit hiked up due to it being a tourist hotspot nowadays. Stalls are plenty but most are selling same or similar items. Pick any stall and wont be dissapointed. Tips: walk back to Orchard was nice and so do-able.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Too cosy,positive,40,2-Jul-18,"This restaurant could be every steak and fries fanatic’s dream come true or not, it really depends on how much of a food snob you are.The tables and seats were too closely positioned together for my comfort but if you can overlook that bit during a crowded evening, then you have my admiration! Making a table booking was seamless, finding a parking lot is a headache.The no-brainer dish to order is steak and fries, and it comes served to you in two portions; the second portion of meat is placed on the tiniest candle burner on a side table. Do not succumb to your desires of wolfing the steak down because there is no third portion of steak. Do not get your hopes up! The fries are, however, generously rained down on your plate if you request for it. I found the steak dressing an overkill, but that is just my palate. Do book in advance, or just get prepared to be turned away. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly staff & nice food,positive,40,11-Dec-17,Staff are friendly . Food is nice . Unable to try all as too many variety to choose. Will definitely go again.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok food. Horrible service. Terrible air conditioning,negative,20,5-Jul-14,"Food is ok. Thin slices of meat. However, the air conditioning is horrible. It was so hot that we had to move outside for dessert. Service is also bad as no one tended to us when we moved outside to get better air. We could have stood up and walked away. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Vegetarian Food,positive,50,8-Dec-17,"Rest assured, always get Indian Vegetarian food with awesome staff who are eager to help. Dal Makhani is best we get here, in Singapore."
French,Saveur,Food standard dropped!!,negative,20,6-Jul-17,Went to visit Saveur at The Cathy few days back. Their signature pasta used to be one of the must order starter at Saveur but now the standard has dropped. The pasta taste blend and their duck confit was so salty. Overall quite disappointed with the food. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Cote de boeuf,positive,40,12-Dec-15,"Les Bouchons is always my choice of restaurant for good steak. This time I ordered the cote de boeuf for 3 pax (2 adult and 1 child) sharing. When the steak arrived, it was near perfect. As usual, the meat is tender and juicy, well grilled to medium to our delight. However, the meat around the bone is rare. Maybe, the next time I will request the bone to be well cook so I can bite on it. My kid feels that the fries should be crispier and that will be perfect."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best food & best service from Kikuchi San!,positive,50,11-Feb-14,"This was our third visit to Shinji (but first time to EOI branch).Kikuchi San was the sushi master who served us all this while.He was such talented chef. He prepared the food according to our needs, especially for my children. He knew that my children like kani maki (crab hand rolls), he especially prepared the real crab meat to make the kani maki for my kids. Usually the kani maki found in the market was the crab stick (make from fake crab or fish).Service was the best ever get from a fine Japanese restaurant.The food was imported from Japan everyday. They were fresh and juicy!The restaurant was sharing a same level restaurant space with another Chinese restaurant.Shinji EOI had only sushi counter which could only serve 8 to 10 guests per meal session.And it was the branch last day of operation. We were told they will be shifting to St. Regis soon.Can't wait to visit you again Kikuchi San!"
French,Saveur,dinner before movie,positive,50,10-Oct-17,"made a reservation through Chope for Saveur as im looking for a french meal before watching a movie, good service staff, good food and im giving the thumbs up, will recommend my friends if they are looking for french food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth traveling to wait in a queue,negative,20,08/14/16,"I don't like to give any poor marks in my reviews, but I can't help it this time.This restaurant has received many good reviews on the Tripadvisor, and was acclaimed for offering good food for reasonable prices in the guidebook we brought. As we stand in line to get a table, I saw people apparently from all over the world as well as locals; my expectations for their food were raised.However, as another reviewer commented, the atmosphere was like a busy factory. It didn't look particularly clean. As we sat at a table, a waitress busily brought us a pot of tea and wet paper napkins along with a menu. What surprised me later was that the tea and the napkins were chargeable; we certainly didn't order them in the first place! The pot of tea turned out to be the most expensive item on the bill at 5.40 SGD.The food quality was okay. As they offered dishes off the pushcart, we didn't bother to look at the menu. The prices of the dishes ranged from 3.80 to 4.80. Some people say their dim sums are of the top quality; I thought they were just above the average. The service charge of 10% was added at the end though I didn't feel we had received any special ""service"" to speak of. After all, you wouldn't be met with much smile at all, and the unasked-for items are charged.Does the total cost of 42.50 SGD for seven dim sum dishes (and tea and towels) sound reasonable? I just don't know.On the way back, we saw many other good-looking, cleaner eateries with smiling wait staff in the China Town. Why not give it a try at another restaurant next time? Would I come back to this restaurant in my future visits to Singapore? Definitely no."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Extensive wine list,positive,40,7-Dec-15,"This is my first time at WG and mostly probably last as the self indulgence cost was a bit too exorbitant for my taste bud. My wife had arrange birthday dinner week for me in Singapore to try the various fine dining spots like Les Amis, Iggy's, Odette, and Andre.You have been warned ahead upon reservation about the shared seating counter arrangement with griddle cooking fashion and the high prices for drinks and food.The 'funny or interesting or odd' part of the whole dinner was that it felt like a communal private wedding affair where all the guests in the same private room had to go thru the same ritual. In our case we shared the room with 2 other couples and had to hear the introduction of the seafood platter and truffle special offering 3 times.What most guests can't accept as in other reviews have mentioned, was the loud noise from some stranger sharing the counter with you. In our case, we had a loud matured guy sharing his resume or career to his new girlfriend and with the rest of the other guests. For such a high end (exorbitantly expensive) dining place, I would assume most guests would want some privacy and silence.We have never dine much in Singapore because service and food value has never been on par with other countries. The only reason wife chose to dine all these restaurants for once this week was because our annual France food and wine pilgrimage was cancelled due to the attacks.A reputable Japanese chef and friend once told me you can teach a sushi or teppanyaki chef the cooking skills over many years but you cant teach him the art of communication over the counter, which is a major pre-requisite for this cooking approach and in this aspect, half the battle is either won or lost with the customer.WG is prime for this aspect of dining experience since it's a counter griddle cooking style but only 3 items (lobster and 2 beef) out of the 10 menu is cooked in front of you. Most of the other food items are pre prepared in the kitchen. But throughout the whole dining experience the chef did not attempt to interact with the guests or because the lack of usage of the griddle or lack of presence of the chef since he is cooking in the kitchen instead, which I am trying to figure till today.Bottomlime, what's the objective of a shared counter dining experience when little is being shared except from some annoyance and loud noise from some other guests. I had to attempt to make small talk with the chef in attendance and ask him what sauce is he using, which area of Tasmania (Cape Grim vs Blackmore) is the beef from ? What grade is the Omi beef ?Just to reinforce what the earlier reviewer mentioned about the bread, I share the same sentiment that the mgmt need to quickly get a new pastry chef to relook at their pastry offerings. Or maybe have a meal at Andre and Odette just for the bread basket.Overall, food portions are small but of extremely high quality produce. I give them high marks for the food (except pastry), but low marks on the dining experience that's why the 4 rating instead of a overall 5.WG will get their 1 star but may be awarded 2 stars because of its extensive wine list, DRC is priced between $45k to 55k a bottle. Heard no high rollers have open a bottle yet.Just for name sake and if you do not mind paying $750pp and share a counter seat, pls dine here. If not, I think Andre, Odette, Les Amis (in order of rank) has better value and better fine dining experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not too good,negative,20,19-Dec-17,Had the lunch buffet. Fish wasn't very fresh imo and some were slightly sour. Nothing that really stood out frankly quite disappointing.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),F1 with VIP,positive,50,09/18/16,"Greeted with a genuine smile and escorted to a nice quiet table. Drinks menu were offered immediately after cold towel were served. What a relief after such a hot and humid evening at the F1 race. The food is awesome complimented with Chef Kam coming to say hello after I gave feedback on the glass noodles which my guest enjoyed. A great delight and opportunity to see the service crew working so well with the kitchen staff. Excellent service rendered to my guest especially from Sook Teng, Alicia and Bowie. I will be back with more of my VIPs. Thanks for a fantastic evening!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food,positive,40,11/19/14,It's a charm restaurant with good food. The food is Chinese Style but not oily and strong flavor like the normal Chinese food I tried in other restaurants. It tastes delicate.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chefs must be on leave ,negative,20,05/29/18,"I have been a regular customer and bringing overseas guests there or the one at East Coast.Having eaten black pepper and chilli crabs, i decided to try something different; saltes egg cream. It was disastrous. I expect it to be creamy but instead it's dry. The crab meat was harden and shrunk as it was over fried. They even had the skin to charge more for the preparation. The roast duck was not completely cooked with raw bloody flesh at bone. We were told that a new sercing will be prepared but we were presented with a steamed roast duck that tasted like a overnight dish. The vegi dish was no better than a coffee shop zicar. My guess is that the chefs must be on leave that evening and all the dishes were prepared by trainees. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,positive,50,17-Mar-17,There is a variety of fresh food! The salmon slices although thick was really good! It was an eat-all-you-can buffet and hence I felt it was very value for money!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Hong Kong food affordable & tasty.,positive,40,10/25/13,"The Good =)~Excellent chefs whip up great HK dishes.The Bad =(~Some dishes are meant for sharing & not for 1 pax, good to check with the waiter first.My Tip for future visits:~Try to avoid during dinner times which has a long wait."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Undercooked Satay,negative,30,20-Apr-17,"Went for a dinner in this newly renovated hawker center in Newton. My colleague and I, ordered different dishes in one of the sea food . He ordered also satay in one of the Halal Satay stall. But lo and behold, the satay taste was disgusting. Its undercooked and taste like a raw mutton and chicken too. I spit out some of the portion and did not bother to touch others. I believe this is the worst satay i ever taste. Other dishes like the chilli crab were okay, but the bun they gave also not fully baked. I was so disappointed coming back here."
French,Paul,Ok food but useless staff!,negative,20,23-Sep-16,"Stopped by here for lunch with a girlfriend. We ordered 2 glasses of champagne to sip whilst deciding on what to eat. The waiter informed us that they didn't serve champagne, only beer! I ordered a cappuccino and my friend opted for tea. We started to browse the menu and surprise surprise, champagne by the bottle or the glass. We called over the same writer & showed him the menu, he looked very vague and said he would see if they had any.The champagne arrived, hooray! The food was fine, nothing exceptional but it was ok.I wouldn't bother visiting again due to the waiting staff who really should grasp the knowledge of what is on offer on the menu - it's not even a vast menu! I guess you get what you pay for & suspect this establishment pay a very basic salary & therefore attract total muppets, shame."
French,Paul,This one for me is a no brainer... plain hype and fluff,negative,10,3-Sep-15,"1) Cramped2) Really awful service and incompetent staff3) Not worth paying that much for food; you're paying just for the location(One the other hand, I say the complete opposite of Paul in Dubai JBR location, that one was worth looking forward to a Sunday brunch!)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent sashimi and maki,positive,50,24-May-17,The sashimi was cut very evenly and the texture of the fishes were unreal. I loved how fresh all the fish tasted. The grilled alacarte dishes were very delicious too.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",disappointing,negative,10,3-Sep-16,"What’s all the fuss about? Nothing special. In fact for these prices (one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore) it was profoundly disappointing. They appeared to be doing things to win them Michelin stars and to impress rather than make interesting and tasty food and be sincere. There wasn’t a single dish which stood out on my fish/meat menu and the person I was with's vegetarian one. There are better Japanese restaurants at Pan Pacific and even Kinki beats it. Not worth the money, wine was exceedingly overpriced even for Singapore and the whole experience wasn’t especially enjoyable. Felt forced and insincere."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good food, very expensive!!",negative,30,10/26/15,"eat there some time ago... good food, small portion, freaking expensive! Recommended dish... Shark cartridge soup, roast duck and roast meat, can't remember the rest. everything is ok , NOT the price!!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good chats, value wise remain unconvinced",negative,30,18-May-14,"Went back to Kailash Parbat recently, wanting to have chats for Sunday brunch. While good and consistent food taste wise, I do think that they need to rethink their pricing a little bit. 13-15$ for a vegetable dish, 3-4$ for a cup of instant coffee and 8$ for a small serving of Kulfi probably pushes it a little bit. We tried their signature Chola Bhatura, and it is a stand out good dish. Their shahi dum aloo left a lot to be desired - chaat items are consistent as always and service was good all around."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Awesome South Indian restaurant ,positive,40,8-Dec-17,Ananda Bhavan is a Vegetarian restaurant serving South Indian food. It is located near Little India. One can try mysore dosa and variety of dosas.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mixed feelings,negative,30,14-Jan-13,"How to rate a restaurant that serves great food which however made us sick later that night?! We went to Waku Ghin last week, the concierge of our hotel highly recommended the place and most people on Trip Advisor liked it very much, so we gave it a try. We had a great evening with really nice food; we recognized most comments previous visitors wrote on TA: too expensive but good. Things went wrong later that night when I found my husband with his head in the toilet pot. The SIN$ 1.100 dinner came back out again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya back at his brilliant best!,positive,50,9-Oct-12,"Yes, it is very expensive (SG$400 per head), however it both met and in some cases surpassed our expectations. It has been a while since we have been to Tetsuya’s Sydney restaurant and we always found the food to be a mix of good and great dishes. At Waku Ghin we are at another level, the food is absolutely fantastic. The regional emphasis of the food here is Japanese rather that Australian. The whole experience is taken to a new level with the “private” kitchen and dining room for all courses up to desert. Your chef for the night prepares and cooks most of the courses in front of you, providing commentary on what is being prepared, where it comes from and answers any questions. Our chef was a young Malaysian from Melaka, he was happy to explain each dish as he prepared it.The signature dish, Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar was a triumph – my partner, never one to be too experimental with food is now a convert to both Sea Urchin and Oscietra.With the exception of the Abalone (a food that has never caught our imagination) we thought the whole meal was fantastic. Our dishes included Pan fried Ayu (fish) with Daikon and Fennel, Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon, Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass Beef (Cape Grimm) with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard and Japanese Ohmi Wagu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy.Green tea called Gyokuro is the final course before you move to the more relaxed desert lounge. The excellent deserts (Soup of Strawberry with Lychee and Coconut and Ghin Cheesecake) is follow by generous quantities of devine Petit Fours with tea or coffee.Given our experience on this visit, it is very likely that we will be back the next time we are in Singapore.Highly recommended for a unique, fabulous and memorable meal."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointed with my steak,negative,30,13-Dec-15,"The starters and desserts were good but I was disappointed with my steak. It was tough and very fatty, which I didn't expect for supposedly the house best. The fries were delicious though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Food and serice flawless, world class restaurant, one glitch that almost ruined it",positive,40,16-Jan-18,"Waku Ghin has delivered all the way on food and service. I made a mistake on the date of the reservation on my calendar and the day before I thought I had a reservation they called me and asked me where I was. Totally my fault, they changed my reservation to the next day, great service.I had the tasting menu (like everybody else) with wine pairing and the food was simply out of this world. My favorite was the Uni and the beef, just amazing. Every dish was masterfully prepared by the chef right there, he answered all my questions but was also very non-intrusive. The service was outstanding... However there was the room next to us with a group of five, yelling and screaming the entire time (except for the smoking breaks they took). It was so loud I had trouble hearing the chef in front of me. I kept complaining and I get the idea that it I hard to compromise between paying customers. The couple next to me moved to the main dining room because it was to loud. I see what the problem I, dealing with an obviously drunk group, however my experience was almost ruined.Waku Ghin is expensive, and the experience should be perfect, that is why I gave them only a very good rating.Dessert is served in the main dining room with a view of the light and water show."
French,Poulet,"Good food, good value",positive,40,28-Dec-13,"After watching a movie at GV, we came across Poulet so we decided to try it out. It's reasonably priced (about $15 per dish), for nice ambiance and good food. I ordered the mushroom soup and Salad de Paris and my husband ordered the oxtail dish and a side of baguette. The soup was very creamy but delicious and the salad was good but only consisted of tiny amount of avocado and slightly too much dressing (a little too sweet), but it was fresh and good. My husband's oxtail was incredibly soft and flavorful, but the slices of baguette (for $5) could have used a bit more butter and toasting (only the top one came out a little browned). Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will be back to try a few of the other items on the menu that looked good!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive hawker fare,negative,20,16-Aug-12,it is generally a rip off place and prices are beyond almost any other hawker centres in Singapore. Gives tourists a bad impression of Singapore.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood in town,positive,50,05/14/13,"It may not be possible to get to eastcoast all the time. Dempsey is turning into an upmarket wine and dine area. Long beach keeps it's menu at affordable prices similiar to it's eastcoast branch. The food is excellent. Outdoor seating is nice but there isn't really a view. The restaurant is very popular with tourists, business visitors and locals. Reservations are highly recommended. For those of you who enjoy Durian, there is a Durian stall near the open car park near the entrance of Dempsey road. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety but don't expect any quality for this price,negative,20,3-Jul-16,"We paid $37++ for 2 (with a one for one promo) for a buffet lunch which was the most I would be willing to pay for the quality of the food here, especially when Robertson Quay is dotted with good quality Japanese restaurants all over. Sashimi - edible but not fresh. Beef and udon - tasted terrible, left them on the table. Chawanmushi was not bad. Yakitori sticks were really poor quality especially the chicken parts (gizzard, heart)... Probably stored frozen for a long time before they were served. My previous visit wasn't as bad as this one as I recall the sashimi used to be a lot fresher. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant..."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),40th Wedding Anniversary of Simon & Dorothy De Silva on 11/9/2016,positive,50,9/12/2016,"Dear friends, On the 11th September, my family celebrated our Parents' 40th Wedding Anniversary at Peach Blossoms in Marina Mandarin located on the 5th floor. We reserved 7 tables for family and friends to be held there for dinner. Our immediate family had lunch together there too. It was a very memorable meaningful time together and we had the best service there ever. We are regular patrons at Peach Blossoms over the years at Marina Mandarin and have come to be acquainted with the staff there as well. The staff are very pleasant, friendly, helpful, attentive and gracious. They are willing to go the extra mile for you and are willing to go the full nine yards. They are attentive to the details and are willing to assist in our preparations. They are very patient and remembers what we have told them in advance and carry it out later for us. They are motivated individuals who takes initiatives too. My family's event went very smoothly without a hitch and it's all 'Thanks & Credit to the staff - Assistant Restaurant Manager Nobel Chang and her team Bowie, Sun Jing and Hui Hoon(unsure if I spell it correctly the name)"". They have been truly professional, hospitable, and helpful to us. My family are very thankful to them and grateful for their service. We will certainly be going there for meals and our guests thoroughly enjoyed their meals commending it as tasty, sumptuous and delicious. Peach Blossoms ought to take pride in their staff from Chefs to Service Staff. Thank you Peach Blossoms at Marina Mandarin for a blessed memorable experience. With Gratitude, Desmond De Silva"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent service,positive,40,06/30/18,"We had friends from the US, and brought them here for dinner. The chilli and black pepper crabs were quite good. We also ordered vegetarian fried bee hoon for one of their children who does not eat meat, as well as mee goreng, calamari, fried baby squid, and spinach with three eggs. All the dishes were generally tasty, though prices were pretty high as well.But it was the service that wowed us. As we had three children below 10 years dining in the group, the staff helped to deshell the black pepper crab. When one of the kids threw up, staff Lynn preferred some oil for her stomach, as well as extra plastic bags in case she threw up in the vehicle. Overall, the meal was good, and cost $400."
French,Saveur,Great!,positive,50,13-Aug-17,"Food is good, service is good too. Had a great dinner with friends there. Reservation process was easy and were allowed to sit down first and wait for others to arrive. Food was served quickly and the staff were helpful when we want condiments or a refill of water. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Could be much better,negative,20,24-Jun-15,"Visited the outlet in Suntec (near the fountain) for lunch today. Opted for the steak and fries, which came with a salad as a starter. Food was bland and unappealing and the steak wasn't anything particularly special. The restaurant was only about half full at lunch time which perhaps should have been a bit of a sign of the quality to be expected. Total cost for 2 was about $50 which I guess was ok. Overall it could be much better and it's honestly hard to recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth the visit,positive,50,6-Feb-13,"While holidaying in Singapore we took our friends to the Newton Hawker Centre as this was their first visit. They were amazed if not a little cautious at what was on offer. We picked a stall and feasted on a variety of dishes from king prawns (they had never seen ones so big), a mixture of satay and some other tasty dishes. They said it was the best meal they had ever had. We were looked after so well. We know we paid far more than what the locals would but we realised that being tourists they were likely to put their prices up. When comparing it with what you would pay in Australian dollars we were still very happy and would still go back again. An experience worth having and no, none of us got sick, for those who are apprehensive about eating at these places."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese food I experienced in a long time.,positive,50,17-Mar-15,"Fantastic Japanese food. Freshest and one of the best quality I experienced ever.
High prices but worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can be better,negative,30,13-Aug-13,"Family of 3 went in February 2013 for dinner. Maybe I came here with too much expectation. I was not impressed, atmosphere was stiff and the service is not that great with exception of the chef who prepared the food in your presence and one or 2 of the waiters. Unlike some other restaurant of the same calibre or price range it lacks the wow factor. Moreover there was not much privacy, people are watching you all the time. Chairs are also not too comfortable. Food was just average. Will only go back if someone else is willing to give me a treat which I think is not quite possible except my hubby."
French,Saveur,Saveur@Cathay,positive,40,21-Jul-16,"It was not bad for a casual French cuisine restaurant and quite good value, especially when there is promo. Especially like the salmon confit - A Must-Try!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit of a let down,negative,20,01/23/17,"We are a fan of dimsum having had these since we were young. The typical Chinese dishes you'll see in the Philippines. We also have done a lot of dimsum exploration in HK.Being in the CNY season, we wanted to have dimsum and a walk around Chinatown. Yum Cha is very popular.The ambiance is close to HK dimsum places with the noise, push cart food and most servers speaking only Chinese The food looked authentic. But the taste was far from our expectations. The siomai were the best and that's the only one that got a repeat order. Everything else was just to try and unfortunately, no repeat. To be clear, the dimsum was not bad. Just that the expectations to be the same as authentic HK dimsum was not met.Quite a pricey place too with dished between $4-5 per plate."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Yummy food and considerate service.,positive,50,24-Jan-18,"It is quite a small place, The seating is for about 30 people max.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware but good food if you know the place,positive,40,25-Feb-13,"This is a classic touristy place in Singapore but that doesn't mean all the stalls serve touristy food. I lived in Singapore for two years and have visited other times and still enjoy the experience here because I can get all the food I want in one location. I would steer clear of the seafood as there are better places to get it but the carrot cake, Kway Teow, and Chicken Wings are all good. I also like the big area and that they deliver to your table. This is a good place for a tourist to wet their appetites but beware of price and quality."
French,L_Angelus,Best french food in Singapore,positive,50,31-Mar-13,"Amazing restaurant, service was fantastic, all the waiters were very knowledgeable about the food and wine served in the restaurant. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, well presented, top quality produce. Simply the best dining experience I have had in Singapore. My husband and father shared La cote de boeuf angus, it was perfectly seasoned, top quality beef - mouth watering. I ordered the roast duck, again perfectly cooked served with a delicious rich (in colour and taste) fig sauce. La pièce de résistance was the famous hot chocolate cake - Magnificat!!Go and treat yourself to a top class foodie experience. Hats off to the chef."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Don't like it,negative,20,07/23/13,"The food was good, my family all agrees with that. but we had to pay for the foods that we didn't even order, and the food came out really late. I think it is because we are foreigners. We also had to pay for peanuts and wet tissue even though they were there at first!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,negative,30,17-Oct-16,"Sashimi was fresh. Other food items - not bad, but not fantastic either.Tablet for ordering was lagged, & then went crushed - resulting in some items ordered but not captured.Had to re-order manually with the service staff.Overall ambience not too bad. Can go? Probably yes - for the experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast and attentive service with awesome thick sashimi that I enjoy !really hoping for more credit card collaborations.,positive,50,2-Jul-16,"If you are a lover of thick fresh juicy sashimi, Shin Minori is definitely your kindda place ! Was using the entertainer app on an 1 for 1 promo thus it was a great deal .unlikely to go if there is no 1 for 1 though ..If I'm paying the full price , I would rather go hokkaido sushi restaurant which is also currently priced at $38 for ala carte buffet lunch "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selections of Dim Sum..,positive,40,8/2/2014,Went there to try their Dim Sum Buffet after spend the morning at River Safari.. Was overwhelmed by the variety of delicious dim sums and we enjoyed it.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,attached bakery,positive,40,12/22/17,"so crystal jade also has a bakery arm attached to the restaurant, called ""Crystal Jade My Bread"", not very original but the breads are quite decent."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a visit for the experience,positive,40,29-Jan-12,"While some comments state this isn’t the best hawker centre in Singapore, we still had a thoroughly enjoyable mealThe downside to the huge choice of stands is that you cannot pass, pause or even look at them without being targeted by their owner. Each outlet is obviously keen to get you to eat at their own establishment. A polite ‘just looking’ does the trick, but only until you venture three steps to the next stall!Eventually we gave up and selected stall No 78, after the owner Margaret went to great pains to explain the menu and process.All the stalls seem to push fish, probably due to it being more expensive. We were given laminated menus with pictures of the food and prices clearly displayed. Most of the dishes came in four sizes, in general small, medium, large and extra large,We ordered a medium fried rice (plenty of prawns in it), a small lemon chicken and a small fried dumpling plate. The latter contained ten decent sized prawn filled dumplings. The three dishes provided more than enough food for two to share.Drinks are ordered separately from vendors that only deal in drinks. You do not need to leave your seat to order – the vendor will find you. All food and drink is paid for at the end of the meal. Cost for the three dishes and a large tiger beer (approx 650ml) was SGD36. Well worth the trouble of a visit"
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathy,positive,40,11-Mar-16,Will revisit & recommend. Food is good. Pricing average. Saveur Pasta a must to try. Except no coffee...
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Might've been good,negative,20,11/27/16,"I was by myself, hungry, and only had a short time to eat, so decided to order 2 items for takeout from the dim sum menu. Half an hour later, I was still waiting. Not only was I starving, but I couldn't help but wonder why all the other patrons were getting their dim sum while I was just sitting there watching and waiting for my measly 2 to-go items. They weren't that busy. When I finally got up to inquire, for the second time, and say I was out of time to wait, the woman who took my order rushed into the kitchen and came back with one of the items (the black pepper duck buns) and then grabbed the other item that had been sitting on the counter for at least 20 minutes already, and said they made a fresh batch of the black pepper buns for me. That's nice and all, but the shrimp dumplings that were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes were now ice cold and greasy. It's too bad, I was excited to try this place, but won't give it another shot now."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Nice, but so expensive",negative,30,15-Jul-14,"I like to taste many bites for different flavor experiences. The chef knows what he's doing undoubtedly. The problem is that when we got out of the restaurant we weren't only hungry but disappointed...we paid 1.600 $, and we didn't think it was amazing...they charged a bit than 11$ for very very small coffee, considering what we were already paying. The staff attention is good, flavor is good, but I honestly don't think that the price is right. I like the fact that we had the opportunity to go, but wouldn't repeat it. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good range of dishes,positive,50,17-May-17,"Having driven past this hawker centre literally for decades, I decided to make it my mission to visit. It was quite late in the evening, but the place was still jumping. I decided on noodles and a beer. Both were very pleasant. I will definitely be back to try more of the interesting cuisine on offer."

French,Paul,Very average.....,negative,20,18-Sep-13,And the price is high.....not French food by any standard .....we went for lunch and and we're very disappointed .....my husband ordered cod fish which came with a little salad without ant dressing and steep at S$ 27......I had a Provençal tartain ....which was served on soggy bread....not a what i expected........very little cheese ....shavings of outer peels of vegetables ....very average.....
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Tea time with poor service ,negative,20,14-Jan-16,"I visited this restaurant on my way to the major department store across of it as I was craving some Masala tea. I like the Masala tea freshly made and with no sugar. I know this place makes it with both requirements. While the tea itself was what I expected, the service have much to improve. I asked for the tea from an attendant upon entering. She was counting coins and even though seemed she took the order, I wasn't sure as there was no welcoming response, and just kept counting coins. I sat down hoping an attendant would approach, but to no avail. I stood up to get the menu myself as I considered also having some snacks. Was about to walk out since no one approached and was unsure the tea order was made, but just then the tea arrived(on a cup poorly served and stained from serving the tea itself). Just decided to have the tea but no snacks. The snack options on the menu are not as varied either. During my entire stay, no one approached. The tea is good but the service has much to improve. Likely will not return either. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you like sushi you must go to Shinji,positive,50,14-Sep-16,"Located at the Raffles hotel, we went there not knowing what to expect, once we got there and saw a small restaurant we knew the experience was gonna be epic.If you come to Shinji you know you will get the best sushi in town..100% fresh!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fantastic teppanyaki-omakase dining, the best in Singapore.",positive,50,13-Apr-13,"We ate at Waku Ghin in early April - my wife, 10yo daughter and I. Enough has been said here about the nature of the food already - it's exquisite, and the local, Tetsuya-trained chef at your table will not disappoint. All courses will be memorable, but for me the grilled Tasmanian abalone was just divine. They were great with our daughter, and she shaved the wasabi for the table with the chef who was warm, attentive and personable in a way that we've rarely seen here. There are staff aplenty quietly swarming behind you to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and the service is of a very high standard. At the end of the meal, you're escorted into the dessert room, an elevated, large glass-windowed space of tables from which you view the light show at the Marina (a little reminiscent of Quay in Sydney). By this stage, I was only able to manage coffee and petit fours, having been wonderfully and cheerfully fed some of the world's best food. Expensive, but I'd happily recommend this as easily the best possible restaurant experience in Singapore."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good Food but poor service.,positive,40,19-Jan-14,"For starters, we had the potato wedges and crispy okra. The actual taste did not match the description in the menu. We expected more flavors. For the main course, we had Mysore Mutton, Malabar fish curry, chicken vindaloo and yogurt.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,positive,40,21-Sep-15,"Good food, good sashimi, decently fast service when it comes to serving your sashimi, unlike other restaurants.
Unfortunately, I find it a little too pricey. It cost almost 100 dollars (inclusive of GST and service charge) for just 2 person, for a weekend dinner."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Shinji,positive,50,3-Oct-12,"Shinji and Au Jardin are probably the only 2 restaurants in tripadvisor's top 10 deserving of their placing here. There are many other good restaurants in singapore that are languishing in the lower ranks and they are beaten by Mcdonalds and Starbucks. sometimes tripadvisor's restaurant ratings just beat on a different drum...Anyway back to Shinji. Definitely a top 10 restaurant here in terms of food and service, and probably the best restaurant in raffles hotel. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the price is prohibitive but if you have to import fresh seafood from Tokyo twice a week, and you have to spend 6 years learning how to make an egg roll worthy of Shinji, they sort of need to charge this much. And yes, going for lunch instead of dinner will be lighter on the wallet. We took the 12 pc sushi lunch set and boy, was it a procession. Like all great japanese restaurants, they don't serve you all 12 pcs at 1 go. They first give you some appetizers, and then the sushi, piece by piece. By the time we had the 12th piece, and dessert, 2.5hours passed! and i was stuffed beyond belief. And of course, each thick fresh piece of sashimi on the perfectly vinegered rice was heaven. And of course, the egg roll which the chef took 6 years to learn how to make. Service was great, and the sushi chefs were very personable as well. Will need to return for more lunch sets"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and delicious,positive,50,16-Mar-16,"This place is a large outdoor foodcourt. Its a hawker centre, opens later in the day. Plenty of tourist and locals eat here. Food is pretty cheap here. I spent $5 in total for a decent meal with a drink here. The skewers are the best, costing me only 60c per stick. No table service, and no air-conditioning, its outdoor. So its a bit hot and humid, but thats normal singapore weather. Overall, an enjoyable experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for Money,positive,40,23-Mar-15,"Basically, for a really reasonable price, you can get a plate of salad, good quality steak with a pretty nice sauce and unlimited fries. Don't come here if you're looking for variety or a really fine dine experience. But it doesn't hurt to come here when you're craving steak while on a budget."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated for the Duck,negative,30,12/10/2016,"Roast Duck - Nothing special especially for $40 a duck.
I prefer the dim sum. Buns were very tasty. Reasonable and nice.
Service is poor - an older gentleman did all the work."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best black pepper crab!,positive,50,01/14/16,"Had an amazing meal at long beach. Black pepper crab was so intense in flavour & the chilli crab was lovely and rich, it was such a shame to have to leave the rest of the sauce! We also had the whole peeking duck which I highly recommend. Having the skin taken off & rolled up into pancakes at our table then having the meet brought back stir fried over crispy noodles was one of the most memorable and tasty meals of my trip."
French,Saveur,"Great food, Small portion",positive,40,10-May-16,"go there with an open mind, portion isn't big so don't go there with a hungry tummy and expect it to be filled.. French cuisines are known for small portions. Overall we had a wonderful meal and great location before catching our movie @ The Cathay"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Service was as good as the crab.,positive,50,6/8/2018,"Amazing service from when you first step into the restaurant. It's very busy so make reservations. We ordered the set menu for 2 that included crab AND razor clams (and more) for $168 SGD. The razor clams were fresh and garlicky, the crab was perfectly peppery and delicious. I would come back for sure."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Remarkable experience, everything was just perfect.",positive,50,7-Sep-14,"This is my second time at a Tetsuya joint and I can honestly say that it just keeps getting better. My first experience was at Tetsuya's Sydney for my birthday and everything was just amazing! So when I heard/read that Waku Ghin was rated even higher I knew we had to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday there. Booking was done via email and the team at Waku Ghin made it very easy. There are 2 seatings every night, 5.30pm and 8.00pm. We opted for the latter and the session usually runs for a minimum of 3 hours. 10 courses in total which includes the petit fours and a dessert. There were 5 of us in attendance and it worked out to be around $672 per person including GST and drinks. We were originally planning on wine pairing but that entails 5 glasses (1 litre) per person and that was simply too much for mum and grandaunt.They don't encourage sharing as there would be an additional fee to do so. Instead, we chose 4 glasses per the sommelier's recommendation: Champagne, chilled Sake, White and Red. My dad and I highly recommend this experience as we believe it heightens the once of a kind dining experience. I have to admit I had my reservations about some of the dishes. Just by browsing a couple of reviews I could tell that the sea urchin and abalone are star/staple dishes. I'm not a big fan of either (Sea Urchin in Tsukiji Market and Abalone at various Chinese New Year functions) and I was really worried I would not fully enjoy myself!At the start of the session, each dining party is assigned a personal chef and in turn they will showcase the live array of seafood we were to consume that night. Live, because they started wriggling right in from of my eyes. Honestly, the sea urchin was mind blowing! There was no taste of the ocean nor was there any imperfections with the dish. It was silk on our tongues and fragrant on our palate. Without giving away too much, the abalone was scored thinly and cooked to perfection. The marbling on the Wagyu beef was crazy (but that was to be expected at a place like Waku Ghin) and Chef Masa barely seasoned it before lightly searing it on each side. Writing this review was harder than I thought it would be because the experience was amazing but at the same time I didn't want to give away too much. I believe there should be an element of surprise when you see fresh ingredients respected for its purity and prepared just to enhance the flavours. In essence, all 5 of us agree it was certainly an unbelievable experience and very well worth the money we paid. Also, we now view food very differently and it leaves us wanting much more."
French,Angelina_MBS,SHC,negative,10,18-Oct-17,"It was my 1st visit to Angelina as I am Survival Chic's (SC) Member entitled with 30% discount. When we reached Angelina on 15/10/2017 at 6.30pm as per our reservation, it was quite empty except a couple at the back. We were the only diners after they left and remained so when we left. We flipped through the menu and were disappointed that both the selection of food and pastries were very limited. so we decided to have light dinner by ordering a chicken and fish dishes and it turned out that the fish was acceptable at best, but the chicken was quite bad in taste and flavour. This was not the end of our unhappiness. When we settled the bill, I found that 20% instead of 30% discount was given. I asked the only waiter why this discrepancy and was told that the manager (whom was not at the scene, I noticed the waiter made telephone call to him) said so. I contacted SC's Customer Service the next day and SC confirmed that the correct discount should be 30% for up to 5 pax. I would like to presume that Angelina is not a honorable restaurantas compared to another similar type of restaurant, ANTOINETTE, which we have visited many times and enjoyed the food, pastries and services. For sure, I will never go back to Angelina again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The quality of the food has dropped by a lot!BBQ,negative,20,06/28/17,"Went to Yum Cha in Chinatown for lunch today with the family. I had tasted good dim sum there before and was expecting more or less the same.Unfortunately, today's lunch of dim sum was anything but nice. The seafood fried rice was tasteless, so was the BBQ Pork Rice Flour Roll.The deep fried dishes of Fried Carrot Cake and Sesame BBQ Pork Pastry were cold. Probably cooked earlier and left on the service counter for too long.Basically, if this is the standard now, I strongly won't recommend anyone to spend your money there."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value for money restaurant for Japanese buffet,positive,50,17-Apr-17,"Love it's fresh sashimi, wide varieties of Maki, sushi, soup and chawanmushi.

French,L_Angelus,Walk in dinner,negative,20,21-Aug-17,"First of all, the food was good but the service from the female petite manager was really below average. This is my first time having a meal in a local restaurant that i felt i was actually in a foreigner country. Is kind of disappointing that it happened in our own country and is not surprised that the manager is actually a Singapore citizen herself. She has an attitude problem and the best part is towards her own people."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for lunch ,positive,40,28-Jun-16,"It was a good catch girlie lunch. I had the beef cube not sure why they name it beef cube when it's a steak. It was done medium rare exactly what I wanted. Real truffle fries, highly recommended. The chicken breast was not dry as well though I order the beef! Service was good too.

French,Paul,"Poor service, would not return (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",negative,10,8-Dec-15,"I've visited Paul internationally so was excited to find one in Singapore as I usually enjoyed visiting. However after seating down (ourselves as no one was free to greet us at the door), we waited for 15 minutes and literally ignored, even after glances by the staff members in our direction. The restaurant wasn't even busy but others were being served before us. I had enough after waiting for so long that i approached a staff member at the counter and asked why we were being ignored. They made excuses and said we should have put our hand up, but they weren't looking in our direction enough for us to call out for service. I didn't realise I had to keep my hand up for an extended period to get service. All i received was apologies, and the pastry and coffee was sub-par. Would not return as this place has left a sour taste in my mouth. If you want to be treated poorly this is the place to go"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A nice weekend brunchy kinda place,positive,40,07/30/15,This place did not disappoint me. Had the duck and noodles and plenty of dim sum and polished off everything.

This is my second time there. Our first time was about 7 years ago and we were lucky that Chef Tetsuya was there too for the F1 weekend. Food was of a very high quality and the seafood was as fresh as you can get, though pricings have gone up - degustation was SGD 450 pp and wine pairing SGD 250. The highlight was the uni/caviar/prawn combo for me. Most of the items were similar to the previous time.Desert was at another area with a nice view overlooking the Marina Bay. If you have a special occasion to celebrate and willing to spend, Waku Ghin is a nice place to enjoy Marina Bay Sands."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,C'est une expérience fantastique,positive,50,11-May-14,"Dined at the suntec outlet on the eve of Mother's Day - it was such a wonderful experience. The food was awesome - we ordered the steak & duck confit as main - both are very good especially the steak - the sauce is so unique, the meat is so good. As for the appetizer - don't miss the pâte - it was so smooth - it just melt in your mouth, it goes so well with the bread. Dessert is heavenly - chocolate lava, profiteroles, and vanilla ice cream - are so amazing. The suntec outlet also has a really nice bistro feel....feel like I'm in Paris :)) service is excellent too. I'll certainly return :)"
French,Angelina_MBS,Value lunch sets,negative,30,29-Jul-17,"Ate twice in this restaurant within a week, and had two different experiences.The lunch sets that my friend and I tried offered smart value for money (13.80sgd++ includes a starter, a main and a choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Furthermore, the pastries that we enjoyed for dessert is discounted to only 8sgd, instead of 10/13/14sgd, and the montblanc is divine!) Bill was about 53sgd for two persons.The second time I visited was mid-afternoon, wherein two of us ordered the high-tea set and the third person had ravioli. The latter was commendable; however, the former can significantly be improved. Bill was about 108sgd for three persons.As another reviewer had observed, the hot chocolate served in this branch is awful; it is NOT the same as the one served in Rue di Rivoli:("
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best French style Entrecote in Singapore,positive,40,15-Sep-12,"Set in a French style Brasserie along Singapore river, a restaurant that offers very high quality meat dishes prepared to perfection.
Service is professional and very pleasant
Wine list offers good value wines."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood location,positive,40,4/4/2013,"If you want to have a good selection of seafood with a decent quality in Singapore, choose this restaurant. We really enjoyed it for the second time now, especially the crabs (chilly and black pepper) . It's nice to sit outside, do not have to suffer from air condition. Service is good, prices I guess average for restaurants in Singapore, but the food is really worth it."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Just okay,negative,30,9-Dec-14,"Northern Indian cuisine, reasonably well prepared, but the most enjoyable dish was the naan bread. The rice was nicely fluffy and separated, but the rest of the dishes were forgettable (not bad, just not memorable). Service was prompt."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,positive,40,8-Aug-14,great place to visit for authentic Singaporean cuisine and very cheap! All cooked fresh for you ...lots of locals eat there too so that's a good sign.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent burger!,positive,40,13-Jun-17,"First time i had lunch in an outside place in Singapore but they have a very good ac-system. My food was really good but I missed a little salad with the burger. Other than that, reasonably priced, very friendly and swift service. Excellent for a quick lunch!"
French,L_Angelus,"Appalled, totally appalled",negative,10,26-Aug-14,"While I tried very hard to maintain my virtue, every single aspect of this restaurant was appalling and I could not help but to find myself in negative territory.As this was the first time I had returned to this restaurant in 6 years, perhaps it was naive of me to expect the standard was still upholding.The quality of food, presentation, staff's attention, menu, service standard, everything was absolutely disgusting. I requested my steak to be medium to well-done, and it came out raw in the middle with dripping blood.Plus the meat tasted weird. It wasn't a high quality meat.My shoe string fries looked like a jumbled up wire that didn't resemble anything of a potato, but soaked in greasy oil.The onion soup was disgusting. The french toast on top was already soggy and there was no flavor.The price of lunch wasn't whopping, but if we'd pay $80 a head for LUNCH, we'd at least expect our steak to be done properly as per request.Overall, there were staff hanging around, not particulary doing anything but gawking and glaring at my female client who was Asian in an extremely inappropriate, indecent manner.Entirely embarrassed that I even considered this restaurant to be the venue for my important lunch meeting. Never ever again, will I ever visit this restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Typical Singapore,positive,50,1/9/2015,"very traditional and typical Singaporean Dim sum, cozy atmosphere,traditional ambience, amazing and very helpful staff.Cook very well presented and cooked to perfection,Located right in the middle of Chinatown on a second floor corner.The place is a little difficult to find because of all the little stores lining up the alleyway, once you find it and go up the stairs the place opens up to a pretty nice dining room, very cozy and warm.Will definitely visit again on my next trip."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Variety not as good,negative,30,26-Sep-14,"this was our second visit to this restaurant. I would advise sitting outside, or inside for a large group.

French,Paul,Quality food; had an exceptional time @ Paul Takashimaya,positive,50,20-May-18,Had a late lunch with my friends and decided to pop by Paul for some light bites. Staff was quick to recommend a few selection of appetizers and desserts after to try. We had the mango salad & beef tartine to share. It was exceptional. Had chocolate waffle & lemon tart after! Can’t believe how on point the staff was in her reccomendation. Will drop by again if I’m in the area! Thank you so much Paul Takashimaya :)
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing food,positive,50,28-Dec-16,"It was a special occasion for us and so we splurged on this evening - 9-course dinner with 3 other desserts. Every dish was fantastic. Needless to say, their signature dish of sea urchin, caviar and shrimp was perfectly balanced and fresh. But for me, the best dish was the grilled abalone. I have never had abalone like that, and it was perfectly cooked. I don't want to comment on every single dish. But two general comments. (1) The sauces that they made to match every course were creative and amazing. (2) The attention to detail and the ""show"" part of cooking was memorable. Our chef was a young man but so well-trained and knowledgeable that it was a great conversation the whole meal through. It is hard for me to imagine how this place cannot earn at least 2 Michelen stars. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Superb Indian food,positive,50,31-Oct-17,we had amazing Indian food ....we had Fried rice & Manchurian which was perfect Indian Taste ..we also had Punjabi which was superb too.....one can blindly order any thing i am sure you will get proper taste.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Amazing!!!,positive,50,15-Feb-18,"Went to this place on Valentines night with my partner. We ordered the standard steak dish, medium rare, with fries. It did not disappoint! At only $35, this was easily the best steak and fries I’ve ever had. Melt in the mouth meat, crispy fries, and more food than I could finish.Really lovely atmosphere too, we sat outside and enjoyed the buzzing courtyard and music from next door.I highly recommend this place!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Acceptable Dim Sum,negative,30,11/10/2015,"Visited the outlet near Expo for lunch today. Quite a busy place, but efficient. We had 6 different servings of dim sum and tea for a price of about $35, which seemed like reasonable value. All tasted pretty good."
French,Saveur,worst visit ever,negative,10,25-Jun-16,"Dont waste ur time and money go somewhere else. Service staff is snobbish, food is worst. Totally do not worth the amount been charge. Staff took super long to serve us and we have to keep chasing after our orders. Overall we spend and average of $50 pp and it is just horrible."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet and Helpful staff!,positive,40,15-Mar-18,"(This review is meant for the Katong Square outlet)We were here for the ala carte buffet lunch and as we were early, only 1-2 tables were occupied then. (but shortly, many diners came and it was about 70% full).The restaurant is new (barely started operations no more than few months ago) has a nice and lovely ambience, cosy and it played Japanese songs and music which I think it was great and perfectly nice.We were ushered to a table by the staff, who was very friendly and patient in bringing us through the menu, and how to make the order via the tablet. It was quite ""high tech"" but once you got the hand of it, it was quite easy to operate.The spread of the buffet was quite extensive (over 100+ items), ranging from the sushi to salmon, ramen, udon, tempura, katsu etc. And quality was good too, would say most of the food items met our ""expectation"" or exceeded it. They were fresh, well marinated with tasty sauce and deep fried to perfection.The portion was great and relevant, to minimize wastage and yet sufficient to ""feed"" the hungry stomach. (anyway, you can reorder again and again)Service was overall good. Besides friendly and helpful staff, the used plates were promptly cleared despite of the quite big dinning crowd with only 2 servers! And our orders were also served quite fast unlike some other restaurants that would take a long time for the food to be served.Well, the only feedback we had were as follows. The airconditioning was very powerful and cold (at least from where we sat) and we felt ""freezing"" but luckily thanks to the hot ramen that saved us from the day!To our surprise, there was no dessert or cut fruits in the buffet spread. Usually most other ala carte Japanese buffet would have some ice creams, mochi, jelly and fresh cut fruits within the same price range, to be fair in comparison.Next, there was also no drinking water inclusive in the buffet! This was strange as most of the Japanese restaurants we had visited included that (not to mention some even included green tea, soft drinks or even coffee). A glass of iced water was chargeable at $0.80!!! Though refillable, we felt it was not worth it and so we skipped it (of course not ordering the other beverages as the price was not value for money).For pricing aspect, it was quite great value for money as there's an on-going 1-for-1 promotions for the buffet, so we ended up paying around $50+ for 2 persons, which was wonderful since we were able to try so many different Japanese food.We enjoyed the food here, having tried over 40+ items and if they would include drinking water and some desserts/fruits, it would receive a 5-star rating!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Without the fat duck, this place would be a dead duck!",positive,40,06/13/15,"The only reason(s) to come here are the unique ducks (although the roast pork and the black pepper duck puffs are pretty good). The roast ducks are super yummy - fragrant, moist, tasting almost like geese. In my opinion the best roast ducks in Singapore. Otherwise, other items on the very short menu are less good than at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure (the congees and soups are noticeably bland), and there is no point in coming to the low-traffic Scotts Square mall just for this. Service management is one of the worst in the country - there is always a queue (sometimes extending to one hour!), yet tables are left empty (including some already cleaned) for up to 10 minutes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb quality,positive,50,2-Feb-17,"The sashimi were fresh and they were generous with the portions. It's disgusting to see how other patrons just over ordered and waste the sashimi. It's definitely value for money for the sushi and sashimi. The fried stuff we're mediocre and the grilled ones are better. There is a little bit of inconsistency with the quality of the fried and grilled food but then again, it's a buffet and the chef is really busy handling the crazy amount of orders!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",All Newton Centre stall owners are much too pushy,negative,10,13-Mar-17,Very disappointed because stall owners kept pushing menus in our faces. I will never visit this hawker centre again
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crowded and bad service",negative,20,11-Dec-17,"Food was overpriced for the average quality, ordered truffle fries and the afternoon tea set. only the moelleux chocolate cake was worthy of calories. Staff were lacklustre, requested for chilli sauce twice before they remembered. Even the bill has to be asked for twice. Not worth a 2nd visit. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great dim sum place!,positive,50,08/28/16,Had a lovely dim sum lunch with the family! Tried some of the creative dim sums by the master chef. Otah siew mai was a delightful pick! The black truffle mushroom bao was visually interesting and a fun creation by the chef. kids love it! The usual dim sum items were of fine quality and the dining experience was really pleasant! Very attentive and prompt service!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent for that special occasion,positive,50,2-Jan-13,"The uni (sea urchin) with caviar and crab meat is out of this world. This is their signature dish. The other dishes are all similarly very good. It is slightly pricey though, at around S$500 a person without wine, that is around US$ 400 a person. But for that special occasion, birthday, anniversary, I think it is worth it."
French,L_Angelus,Small French Restaurant in Club Street,positive,40,30-Jan-14,"L'Angelus... If you want french cuisine, just ""normal"" dishes, nothing super fancy, but really honest, then L'Angelus is the place to go. Excellent foie gras or escargots! Very good beef with a gratin dauphinois one couldn't do better at home. Nice location in Club Street, very cosy. I would go there anytime again! And i've been there on nearly all my visits to Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food bit costly,negative,30,18-Jan-16,"Good authentic food. Indian taste. Slightly overpriced specially Tandoori Roti. Ambience is good. Staff is South Indian so difficult to communicate in hindi.
Chana bhatura is good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Quality Japanese Food,positive,50,6-Jul-17,Good variety of choices. The food was fresh and the service was fast. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for quality no fuss Japanese food.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food!,positive,40,11/29/11,"Crystal Jade Palace offers very good quality food though the price may be a bit steep.
Great ambience too."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place for local cuisine and Crabs,positive,50,06/29/16,"This is the place to visit if you want to try the local way of cooking the Crab Dish. Try the Chiili Crabs with buns or the Black Pepper Crab if you like spicy food . For children or adults that do not take spicy food , you could try the mouth watering salted-egg crab. The restaurant also served delicious seafood cuisine cooked mostly the Cantonese style. The restaurant is set in a exquisite location -Dempsey where many other restaurant and cafes are located too . Nearby you could also visit quite a few furniture gallery which sell very nice wooden items . Enjoy "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No.1 in seafood freshness,positive,50,05/16/14,"This branch is quite huge. Being in Singapore means having black pepper crab and I was absolutely satisfied. The crab was fresh and meaty and had just enough pepper sauce on it. It was on the dry side but finger-lickin' good! The prawns and the steamed fish were equally fresh and flavorful. The claypot enoki mushroom and cabbage was clean to the taste. For dessert, we had sweet yam paste with ginko nuts, which for me was a little bit too thick. We washed everything down with refreshing Thai coconut juice. Service was exemplary. Will definitely be back! Tip: There'a a playground where kids could have fun while waiting for the food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet worth the $ if you eat sashimi ,positive,40,25-Mar-17,"I like the a la carte buffet style which requires making our order through the tablet -- it cuts down waiting time and you can decide how big a portion you want, hence reduces food wastage. A wide range is offered, the food is of quality and served hot. It was our second time back and it didn't disappoint. "
French,Paul,Nice place but disappointed ,positive,40,3-Apr-15,"Great patisserie, we've been here many times both sit in and take away, but today we ordered a couple of simple sandwiches and soup. The soup was cold and the sandwich order incorrect - they took ages to fix it, nearly 30 mins despite our complaint. They could do with sharpening up their service to come in line with the premium prices they are charging before they will be deserving of an ""excellent"" rating."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was good but disappointed overall.,negative,30,31-Aug-17,"I picked this restaurant to have my birthday lunch as it had a birthday promo for the lunch a-la-carte buffet. Prior that day I had signed up and received a voucher which I didn't know had to be screenshotted (they did not send a copy to my email). The day before I was due for lunch, I looked in my email for a copy of the voucher but it wasn't there so so tried to apply for it again. And when I did, the website prompted me that I have already been registered. To cut the Long story short, when I explained to the staff about the mix-up, he deliberately just told me that there was nothing I could do about it. Which was a rather weak attempt at service recovery, in my opinion. I considered walking out (I had not ordered yet) but still decided to give the place a shot. I paid for 2 buffets with 2 bottles of sake and was satisfied with the meal however, it was one of the lower moments on my birthday. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth eating for the value,positive,40,3-Oct-17,Enjoy the food and the services are good too as the waitress clear the empty plates automatically without us to call for.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,CHILI CRAB - A MUST!,positive,40,10/29/15,"I have been here a couple of times with my colleagues. Food wise it's slightly better than it's next door seafood neighbor. Their floor staff is always on the ball, ensuring you get what you wanted. Best to make reservation before heading there, opt for private room if you are spending more SGD600 per table. Private room able to combine if you have more than 1 table."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reasonable spread,negative,30,12-Dec-16,"Ordering system improved much from the last time i visited 3 or 4 months back? Sashimi is fresh! But some items can be done better - 1) cha soba was over cooked that it was soggy. N portion size could be smaller. 2) beansprouts was crunchy and nice but super oily :( Other than that, not much complaints. It was even more worthwhile with the entertainer 1for1 deal. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Easy menu,positive,50,11-Mar-13,The l'entrecote in Singapore is a good place when you like steak and frites. The Restaurant is in good location and easy to reach. Might be busy during weekends as they do not take reservations.

On a recent trip to Singapore this was the first place we went to once we had dropped our bags in the hotel. It has changed a little and prices have gone up, but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal of chilli stingray, oyster omelette and fried hokkien prawn mee, washed down with Tiger beer and fresh lime juice. We would have loved to have had more dishes but there was only two of us......Yum!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese buffet!,positive,50,18-Nov-17,"I've been here before and loved it, so I brought my mum this time so she could try it too. Very reasonable pricing for such great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the portions generous. This is a good choice because everyone gets to order what they want (not hampered by different preferences)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced but not too bad,positive,40,10-Jan-14,"This hawker centre seems pretty famous, especially among tourists. At dinnertime, maybe 50% of the customers are Caucasian. The food is highly varied from seafood to cuisines of all different cultures, but the price is probably almost double that you would find in other hawker centres. I've had some pretty terrible seafood there, and my Singaporean friends tell me that the seafood there is not particularly good but worth a try I guess. The non-seafood dishes I've had there are very good through, and the difference of a few dollars I'm not too fussed over. Overall definitely worth a try."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",All you can eat? Yes please,positive,40,23-Nov-14,"Listen, it's an all you can eat Japanese buffet, ordered a-la-carte, for $40 SGD excluding drinks, taxes, and service. I think it's great, the quality of food is better than good, but not great, but again, what do you expect? We enjoy the tuna and salmon sashimi, miso soup, seaweed salad, tempura prawns and vegetables, chicken wings, and some of the chargrilled meats. If you go in with the right set of expectations, you won't be disappointed, you might actually even like it... I sure do."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Vegetarian's delight,positive,50,30-Apr-17,I stayed in Marrison hotel on Desker Road because this restaurent was just 100 mtrs from that hotel. This offered perfectly traditional Indian vegetarian food with excellent taste.

I ordered their breakfast set with sunny side up eggs and ham, and cafe mocha. My wife ordered the Grand Cafe with bread, The food were good, but not spectacular. The mocha was rich but too much chocolate, but this is their way. Later we order a peach cinnamon tart, which is excellent, but we were too full to order more pastries.

You go past each one find the meal you like and you find a table and they bring it to you. They also have a variety of drink stalls. We found the food and drink here very affordable. We only paid $15 Singapore for 2 small meals and a small rice (pretty big portions) and $9.00 for beer (very cheap here). I would highly recommend just for the experience"

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,The nicer location but...,negative,30,3-Dec-12,"Les Bouchons' Restaurant at the River is in a nice location and the outside seating is just great (when it does not rain). Indoor lacks the ambiance of the Ann Siang location and is just too bright and without atmosphere. The food is similar, or is it just the ambiance that makes China Town the better steak? Good quality of meat and fries, a good selection of affordable french wines, but the service could be more attentive and is not that personal."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food in Chinatown,positive,40,1/3/2016,Great spot for dining in Chinatown. The mango prawn is a must I reckon. Not particularly cozy though.

We were instantly bombarded with large menus in our faces from stall holders, it gave you no chance to have a good look at all the stalls. Found a shared table eventually, ordered the food and then went for drinks.The prices we paid were nearly 50% more than Maxwell rd. and it was mostly seafood on offer, we also like to pay for food as we order it, the people on the other end of our table were having a dispute with a stall holder about overcharging them.A good halfway house between Maxwells or Lau pa sat and a restaurant."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The place for your seafood fix,positive,50,9/9/2017,"We just finished a family dinner here in one of their private rooms, served by a very attentive captain who even took our pepper crab claws away to de-shell for us. For big parties (9 of us), their set menus offer good value, as their a la carte prices are on the high side. The price worked out to about $100/head (including drinks of beer and juice), which by Singapore standards is pretty acceptable for a meal in a good setting of quality dishes comprising the freshest of seafood. The menu comprised lobster, crab, steamed fish, duck, scallops with asparagus, noodles and a dessert. Their seafood dishes were indisputably excellent, to be expected of a restaurant that has built its reputation on seafood. The surprise item that we all wow-ed over were the noodles, cooked in an exquisite duck broth flavoured with cabbage leaves and pumpkin. You leave the restaurant feeling good not just with the food but at the way the restaurant staff have all been trained to thank departing guests as they make their way out, making you feel that you have been a most welcome guest."

Service was slow to response and the AI ordering system was not friendly at all. The touch Pad home button was poorly fitted into a metal housing hole which was poorly done and needed really very small fingers to access. Food quality was good but slow to be served after the ordering. My overall experience was average for the restaurant, compensating was the waitress who was very helpful to take photos for us. If you want to be good, you must look into the touch Pads and the holding structures. AI Technology should enhance the ordering experience and not to turn guest away. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food centres in Singapore,positive,40,20-Aug-15,"Singapore's food centres are always the right places for tourists to enjoy local cuisines. In my opinion, Newton is the best if you wish to taste all signature Singaporean dishes, ranging from satay to pepper crabs, from char kway meow to sting ray at one time. Once you enter the centre area, staff members from different stalls will approach you cordially. Just ignore them until you find a suitable one. After you have ordered a few dishes from that stall, you will then be 'free' to buy food from other stalls and you can enjoy a 'nuisance-free' dinner. P.S. There are always water basins around the corners, so you can feel free to savour the palatable seafood in Newton!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,positive,50,09/14/17,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private room and plenty of seats outside . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not impressed,negative,20,8-Jan-13,"Nothing much. Despite the recommendations to go there for the food, I do not get the attraction simple because for that price and the kind of food, I can get it at other hawker centres at better price and similar taste"

What a great place to call in for a snack, cold drink or full on main meal pigout. The food is top quality, service is amazing and even the decor is streets above all the other indian restaurants in Little India. The Chaat is just so fresh and the drinks are works of art. Price is very reasonable."
French,Angelina_MBS,Very Pleasant,positive,40,14-Aug-16,"Had a lovely pot-Au-feu there last night. And scallops and black rice. It's pulot hitam for those who understand. But done with a seafood sauce. Quite delicious. The cakes with ok, but could have been better presented, as they were about $14++ each. We had the Mont Blanc and an opera. Service by Hamiz was good. We had a nice table. However most of the other tables were really tiny. More for just drinks, I guess."
French,Paul,Goôd food and wine,positive,40,8-Mar-18,"To be honest we only chose this restaurant as it was the only one in the Paragon Mall that served wine. Our meal was served quickly and I had the 3 sausages and mash with onion gravy, being a Brit I disliked the lamb and chicken ones but thats my fault. The staff were friendly but not overly attentive. Good atmosphere. 7/10"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy Yum Cha,positive,40,04/24/16,"This Ym Cha Restaurant is located on the first floor in Chinatown (20 Trengganu Street), and it is somewhat difficult to find. There are two entrances - one from the five-foot way hidden by souvenir stalls while the other from the entrance of Jinshan Hotel. From the former, ascend a flight of steps and from the latter, an escalation. The food is quite tasty and price reasonable. The service is efficient. If you are a first timer, you will probably be hungry and sweaty by the time you find this restaurant that straddles 3 shop lots on the second floor."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value Japanese all-you-can-eat buffet,positive,40,24-Sep-11,"I have patronised Minori for a number of years now and have always found their food to be good value for money. The quality is above average and the service is acceptable, considering that each person expects to pay about S$50 nett for all you can eat sashimi. If you are looking for a place to pig out on Japanese food staples, this is the place for you."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lost sushi.,negative,20,7-Dec-15,"I have had the opportunity to try many fine sushi establishment so my review is base on peer to peer comparison. I had high expectations for Shinji but my friend and I were underwhelmed, the fish was fresh although my mackerel had a very strong smell which was distracting. Second, the cut of the fish was wrong. You should be able to chew the fish and not have their tendons spent stuck on your teeth. My friend had to ask for tissue to spit out the tuna which she could not chew. This was unacceptable already. Third, the rolls were not appetizing to your sight. The toro was falling apart. My tuna maki was not cut cleanly and worse of all, rice was stuck outside of the roll. This is something you would expect from the third grade sushi place but not one of this caliber. Fourth, the rice was not delicious. It was not fragrant nor was it warm. When you visit a fine sushi establishment it is usually not the fish that you should be mesmerized by, but for me it is the rice. Shinji did not inspire me. There was no passion in the plating, or care for ingredient. It was as if I went to one of those popular restaurants who know that they are popular and took their eyes off the quality. My plate was never cleaned, the fish was cut recklessly, and overall shameful example of what it should be."
French,Paul,Awful food. Not worth a penny,negative,10,31-Dec-16,Bakery to go maybe ok. But the food is totally crab. Food doesnt look like what was described in the menu and look awful when it landed on table. Cheesy food and not even french nor western. It seems that the outlet has come with its own interpretation as to prepare it. Purist beware! My recommendation. Pls do not waste ur money except u purely eat the bakery. Dont try anything else which are totally horrible.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worst dining experience!,negative,10,30-May-16,"The place was extremely noisy and there were drunkards shouting loudly but no service staff bothered to address that. Had to place my orders FOUR times but the food still did not arrive. Service was bad and we were not allowed to order additional Ala Carte food even though we are paying for that. Spent $165 for 2 servings of sashimi, 2 bowls of plain udon, 3 sets of sushi, 2 servings of vegetables and 4 chicken wings! The rest of the food never arrived. A most horrible dining experience ever!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Jap Restaurant,negative,30,24-Aug-16,"Salmon & Swordfish sashimi was fresh. The tuna was pale & dry. BBQ foods a tad too salty. Overall, acceptable value for the spread. Staff was attentive and pleasant."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore!,positive,50,24-Jan-13,"Went for dinner and had a great time. The food is fresh and the service is tip top! Apparently, the restaurant is so big on seafood from Japan only, they closed during the New Year period when Tsukiji market was closed. The master chef Oshino is a very talented and entertaining chef, and though it looks expensive, for the quality and amount of food..... super place to be dining in!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",wow japanese is great!,positive,50,14-Aug-12,This restaurant is expensive but food very good. We go for birthday night and enjoy alot. The tuna and ebi prawns very fresh and sushi very nice. I want to go again but very expensive.
French,L_Angelus,Expensive La ..! Disappointing ...,negative,30,30-Jul-15,"Heard a lot about that restaurant, so was looking forward to it. Let's set the service aside : the service was good. Friendly waiters and waitresses. The decor was good as well ..nice posters on the wall, high ceilings and good A/C. But the food and the prices were a major let down. 115 Sing dollars for the meal was poor value for escargots / snails and Tartare plus mediocre chateauneuf 2012 .. I was chocked by the wine list and prices...a Cote du Rhone Basic Guigal at 88 Sing is excessive. Simple average burgundies above 110 Sing ..are simply bad value. The snails were swimming in butter sauce - strange recipe - not what you get in France. Average Steak Tartare . All of It ..disappointing."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food in SG,positive,50,8-Jun-16,"Go to place for north Indian food. Good place, friendly staff, tasty food. Usually crowded but definitely worth the wait."

It is pricey but my goodness it's worth it!!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CAN BE BETTER,negative,30,3-Apr-17,"Celebrated my friend birthday there last week. The birthday girl commented the 1st & 2nd batch of sashimi served is with different quality and she is quite dissappointed. Seated near to the live kitchen so the conversation, giggling and comments between kitchen & service staff can be annoying and disturbing. Overall, the whole experience is still good and i look forward to see more improvement in future..... so GAMBATTE!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worthiness of the buffet lunch,positive,40,28-Oct-17,My favourite dish is fried baby cuttlefish and chicken wing. Raw salmon is fresh and juice. May be can try to ask for tables with portable ipad for making order instead of the one that stick onto the partition.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Early Dinner!,positive,40,11/10/2017,"Heard about this restaurant from my daughter. So I had to really give it a try. Although it did not disappoint, it had not left an impression that I need to go back. Decent food. Had the trio-combo bbq combination. It was good enough and the vegetable was also good.Over-all, there is this chinese bbq restaurant over at bugis which has a better duck and char siu IMHO."
French,Saveur,Enjoyable meal,positive,40,13-Oct-18,The place serves tasty food. Their foie gras is melty and delicious. The only complaint is the music is loud.

I nice venue for afternoon tea"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good fun!,positive,40,13-Jan-16,"We caught a cab here one night particularly for chilli crab. It only cost us about S$18 by cab from the Carlton hotel. We walked around before choosing which hawker we would eat at. The prices all seem much the same. We had 4 huge prawns around 200g ea, we paid $8 per 100g so $16 per prawn. Our crab was a medium size & cost us $40. We bought beers from the stall next door. It was a great fun experience & the food tasted great!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average for Singapore but a little pricy,negative,30,10/15/17,"Food was fine in my opinion standard fare for Singapore and 8 of us eating but still hurt a bit when I picked up the bill. Charging for the wet towels was cheeky considering gwe ordered and paid for prawns and two crab. Tried to order the crispy duck but a CA's eof sorry sold out which is also a fail in my book. If passing would probably go back but wouldn't bother to make the trip from downtown again, food from a hawker centre as good or better. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good sushi,positive,50,11-Sep-16,"Last year I went to Hashida sushi, and this year to Shinji. I think both restaurants are equally good. At Shinji my husband and I ordered the Hana set and the Omakase special for lunch. Total bill was about $380+. Sushi is very good, though the pieces seem to be smaller than what I had in Tokyo. I remember that in Tokyo the pieces of fish are much larger than the rice underneath. Here in Shinji the fish and the rice are about the same size.Overall, it is a very good dining experience with excellent service. Though I don't think it is value for money if you compared with what you can get in Tokyo."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",nice memories,positive,40,7-Aug-12,"nice memories of indian street food, which you try to avoid when in India due to the risk of upset tummy, but here you could indulge to your hearts content, quite pricey though, and taste not as 100% authentic as when in India"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Below expectations,negative,20,27-Jun-17,"Was searching for a good steak house to celebrate Fathers day n since Lawrys only had available seating from 8 pm, i settled for this place after reading all the reviews.First of all for those driving, you must be prepared to wait as spaces are very limited.The place was small and cosy but aircon was very weak. Everyone around me was fanning themselves. Portion wise it was huge and they even came around with extras. But sadly none of us really enjoyed the steak. Maybe the meat was not of high grade so it was basically tasteless. Of course the sauce will cover it all but it was not enjoyable. Anyway wont be coming back any time soon."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Value for money,negative,30,11-Feb-16,This place is always crowded and offers excellent food at a moderate price. The only drawback is that you might have to wait a while before being catered to.

Don't eat all day so you can saviour the food. Testuya has well and truly excelled himself in this Japanese inspired restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,negative,30,8/7/2018,"As a Cantonese, average dimsum cannot really be tolerated. Below are those I have eaten:-1) Chee Cheong Fun - Unacceptable skin smoothness, it's rough and I can't even eat it .2) Char Siew Pau - It looks presentable but it's all pastry (flour) and limited meat. 3) Prawn Wanton Crisps - Will never order again. Fillings not solid.4) Meat Dumpling in Chilli Oil - Should be renamed to Meat Dumpling in Vinegar which is all to it. What's Good/Acceptable1) Egg Tart2) Mango Pudding (Slightly on the sweeter side)3) Xiao Long Bai - Rough skin but love the element of rice wine.4) Xiao Mai and Har Gao - Solid and tasty. 5) Double Boiled Soup - Yummy!6) Leaned Meat with Century Egg Congee - OkI won't list it all down. Go give it a try if you are a Safra Member or Maybank Card Holder. We came for High-Tea Buffet and we are satisfied. Value for money. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great dining experience,positive,50,6-Aug-17,It has been a pleasant dining experience. Swift and easy transition to our table upon arrival. The quality of food is good and I especially like the portion of food served. Most food was served a piece at a time allowed us to decide if we want more of those food which we ordered previously. The waiters are attentive and extended help almost immediately when the computer system hanged. Will visit again! 
French,L_Angelus,Lunchtime Bistro Food At Fine Dining Prices,positive,40,17-Mar-12,"Generally nice food, but very expensive for basic bistro cuisine. $46++ for Cassoulet, which is basically a bowl of baked beans with some lumps of meat, is a bit of a cheek. Nice ambience & good service, but I left feeling slightly ripped off in terms of value."

A must visit!,positive,50,5-Jun-15,"A must visit for all whether you've been before in past years as I have in the 1980's or are new to it. Very good satay, Laksa, seafood etc and beer for $7 a big bottle of Tiger beer! Satay 60 cents a stick (minimum 10 sticks) and so tasty. Very good and very inexpensive in a city which isn't cheap!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Probably the worst chinese meal I've ever eaten,negative,20,08/30/14,"There on business we decided on the meal for 2. Expecting a real feast we ended up still hungry at the end and for 200 Singapore dollars including a little wine monstrously expensive. Two soup courses, no rice, grumpy staff no return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,positive,40,14-Sep-11,"Located just off Orchard Road, Newton Hawker Centre is an easy stop for tourists wanting to experience eating outdoors, hawker centre style. The likes of sambal sting-ray, satay, sugarcane juice, mee goreng etc are available albeit at somewhat higher prices. As you approach the hawker centre, many of the stall owners will approach you to ask you to order food from them. You are not obliged to sit down directly. Take your time and have a look around. Look at the dishes on the tables of those who are already eating at the stalls. That should give you an idea of what's good or not and the portion sizes."

French,Paul,Paul - worth a second shot,positive,40,30-Jul-14,"It was my second visit here, this time for lunch with a couple of lady friends.I started with a Tartine Saumon (SGD$19.90) - smoked salmon, avocado, leek , mixed herbs and cheese. The smoked salmon was succulent and not too salty, and I love the combination of this cold, slimy delicacy wrapped around buttery avocado, nestling atop crispy slices of toast. It was a healthy but satisfactory concoction of all my favorite things, done in flavors that danced across the tongue.*Chantal had the Omelette Complete (SGD$14.90) - omelette with slices of grilled turkey ham, mushrooms and cheese served with salad, Provencal tomatoes and potatoes. It was a flavorful piece of culinary art, with the eggs beaten well and taste was well-accorded with a nice balance of the fillings within the protein-rich omelette.I had the Raspberry Tart (SGD$7.90) - Tartlette Framboises - classic fruit tartlet made with a crispy, buttery pastry crust, filled with creme patissiere and topped with raspberries. Contrary to its glossy, syrupy-looking photos, the real tart came with raspberries powdered with sugar / icing instead, giving the sour fruits a sweet guise. The pastry crust was delicious though, and the creme fillings was silky smooth with a light, lovely flavor.*Chantal had the Millefeuille Fraises - crispy golden puff pastry, strawberry creme-filled Napoleon cake topped with light apricot glaze. The combination of textures - crispiness, soft creamy sweetness and juicy bits of real strawberries embedded within this pretty pastry was a sinful necessity in itself - lovely!For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/lunch-at-pauls-bakery-restaurant-cafe.html"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor quality food and service,negative,20,31-Oct-16,"I have dined in Shin Mori a year before, which I have had great experience as the service then was good, so was the quality of food.Encouraged by the good experience before, I went back with 2 other friends on last Friday but the experience was a let down.We were not served any drinks for nearly 1/2 an hour. When we waved to the waiters around, one of them took order for green tea but forgot to serve until we reminded him 10 minutes later. The green tea was not even hot upon serving.The shasimi we ordered was not fresh and the hand rolls were not freshly made.This time my overall experience is poor."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pretty good,negative,30,24-Jul-16,"There are many many different stalls here. Hence, the quality varies. When you get a table, stalls selling seafood will pass you their menus. Ignore if you are not interested. Choose what food you would like and remember to give the stall your table number. Some of the food is top quality stuff, so choose wisely! Furthermore, the food centre looks much better after the recent renovation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,yummy crab,negative,30,08/22/15,"it's my 2nd time visiting long beach. the restaurant here is not as fancy as the one in east coast. but the pepper grab is still star of the whole meal. crab is large and with lots of fresh meats. it cooks perfectly with super matches with pepper.mango dessert is another icon of this restaurant, but more on visual effect than flavor itself.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,More about the service,negative,10,20-Jun-13,"This review is more about the service here than about the food because I'm still waiting for my steak to arrive and it's been more than a 20 minutes since we were finally given our cold appetizers. Probably a one off experience here but thought it worth sharing. We were initially moved to a different table after being seated for about five minutes so they could make space for a larger party. Then after orders were taken have been promptly forgotten by the wait staff, three other tables that arrived after us were served full meals while we weren't even given bread and now I guess they have forgotten about our meal because steaks still aren't here while other tables have been served! Frustrating!"
French,Saveur,Very decent experience,negative,20,15-Aug-16,"- Were told to change table when we were having desert to give way to other customers, which is quite disruptive.

French,Poulet,Most tender,positive,50,21-Nov-16,"This place primarily serves roast chicken. However, unlike most of the dry bland roast chicken served in most places this restaurant has the most tender chicken I've ever eaten. On top of being perfectly cooked the chicken was served with two of the most flavorful sauces I've ever eaten. Side dishes were good but the chicken was perfect and merits a return trip! "

Ordered one for son's girlfriend cos my son and i are not in the habit of drinking water while eating. Refill was good until when the crowd came in. Asked to refill, manager came to tell me that it's the restaurant's policy for customer to order the no. of water accdg to the no.of pax. Tried to see their fine prints but couldn't find. Felt insulted tat he's implying we shared, saving$1.60 after having tho pay close to$150 for the meal. So we told them no need to refill. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi and Jap food,positive,40,11-Jul-18,"We chanced upon this Jap buffet restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. Had a good time eating fresh sashimi non-stop. Restaurant was crowded and service was good, even though they missed out serving me my soft shell crab.

French,Paul,Good food; service can be improved :-),negative,30,28-May-12,"The last time I headed down to Ngee Ann, I noticed that there was a new restau. I was quickly intrigued by the new place upon seeing from afar that 1.) the interiors looked very nice, 2.) the place was packed (a good indicator that it's a must-try), and 3.) there was a queue just outside the dining place. Some friends and I recently tried Paul for a Sunday brunch. Because we arrived at the place around 1130, we didn't have to queue for long to get a table. Our table was very near the bakery of the cafe, which gave us a good view of all the baked goodies. I was more excited about the breads rather than the brunch menu. Hehe!I ordered the Crepe Complete - turkey and cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. It also came with a small portion of greens. For dessert, we got a fruit tart, a lemon tart, Napoleon, and macarons. I must say that I enjoyed dessert more. While the crepe tasted nice, I would have added a few more dollars to what I paid and I could have had a bigger brunch plate at one of the other brunch places around the island. The desserts (and most probably the breads) would be the main reason to head to Paul. Just beside the restau, the bakery would be found. The few hours we sat there, there wasn't a moment where there was no customer buying baked goodies. Really nice. What Paul can improve on is the service. It's kind of challenging to get the attention of the wait staff. Sure, the place was packed but that has never been an acceptable excuse for me. Nevertheless, I think I will go back to Paul to try the mains or if I happen to be in the area, and I'm craving for some nice pastries or freshly baked bread."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yes, this is the best pepper crab in Singapore",positive,50,11/29/15,"The interior in seafood restaurants in Singapore is generally not what you normally associate with fine dining. You sit on plastic chairs and you can forget about white linen. But no big deal – you go there to enjoy the crabs and eating them is a messy affair.Long Beach claims that they are “creator of the original and the best pepper crab of Singapore”. I am personally a big pepper crab fan but I don´t take tag lines like that for granted without my own research.As expat living in Singapore I have done thorough investigations across the island in my search for Singapore´s best papper crabs. My conclusion: the pepper crabs in Long Beach really are the best in Singapore. They are juicy, spicy and deliciously prepared.Case closed.In addition, Long Beach is a nice and an easy accessible place. Book table, take your time and enjoy your food.Not all seafood places in Singapore have the same attitude."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Amazing service, excellent food, fantastic ambience",positive,50,10/21/16,"I organised a special dinner for my father's 79th birthday for 19 guests and planned this about a month in advance. Terry was wonderful and obliged with a private room at the back of the main restaurant. The private room had a really nice ambience and had views of the skyline of the financial centre and Marina Bay Sands. He also helped plan the menu, taking into account my father's special dietary requirements. The service was impeccable and he and Christine devoted themselves to our room, introducing each dish and course as it came and them serving individually, while at the same time ensuring that our drinks were always filled.The food was excellent. The soup was a clear double boiled consommé with free range chicken and was really flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the garlic roasted chicken and the korobuta pork chop was spectacular, with every delicious morsel melting in the mouth.After dessert there was a birthday cake placed on a large plate on which was inscribed a Chinese poem written personally by Terry, who also incidentally personally arranged the flowers on the plate. All in all it was a memorable dinner which my father hugely enjoyed. Many thanks to Terry and Christine and we will certainly return!"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent seafood in cozy ambience,positive,40,12/15/11,Long Beach @ Dempsey located at quiet place but when you enter inside it is quite crowded. Menu offers excellent seafood Singaporean delicacies. The one we tested was Singaporean crab curry alongwith Tiger beer. You can sit outside or book an independent room for small group. The service is very prompt and friendly. Overall wonderful dining experience in Singapore.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Singapore Crab,positive,40,05/21/18,"Prepare to get messy!The crab is to die for, but you must eat by hand and thus endure some greasy hands. It is all worth it though!The sides are good s well, but the real attraction for sure is their crabs. The service is so and so, but very cozy and the laid back attitude actually seems to fit the place quite well and therefore is actually just right. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",not bad,positive,40,24-Mar-17,service and food are not bad. can give a try again. the restaurant is a little too dim though..can brighten up a little
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",A reasonable Indian restaurant in an out of the way location,negative,30,4-Feb-16,"We were taken here by friends as we did not want an expensive night out. The service was good but the food was average. My meat curry was very dry and my friend's chicken was not what he expected, so we were not over-impressed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Decent food, good service",positive,40,29-Jan-16,"If you wish to have decent North Indian vegetarian food near Mustafa then I will surely recommend this one. Evenings are crowded and the staff are usually quite tensed in managing the crowd. Quite often you see even the chefs struggling and the food takes time to be served. But once you get it, it's good!They used to have Arbi tuk, which was heavenly. They seem to have taken it out of the menu and sometimes reluctantly give you it's half Cousin, aloo tuk. The chaat items are extremely good and the Chef at the chaat counter is extremely kind to make them the way you want.Chole Bhatura is quite oily but who cares - it's consistently good. Bhatura and Parata platters which have three or four different types of them are quite filling for two and are highly recommended. Hyderabadi biryani and the Awadhi biryani are also quite good.Chaaz is always too salty but lassis are good. Desserts are just okay.It's a bit pricey but would certainly recommend as it serves one of the best North Indian dishes in this area. "

More atmosphere and busier at night, whereas Tekku Centre, in Little India and Amoy St Hawkers both were better at lunchtime. Had delicious chilli crab from store 42(?). Tucked in corner.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Locals tell me to avoid this place - A tourist trap,negative,30,1-Nov-15,"And so I do, Unless I want thai from 52. The only thai place there. I like the green curry with rice. The store owners are in your face and off-putting for my liking. And even the local paper claims that they overcharge. If you want what the locals like go to Tekka centre. The bus 66 or 67 from newton will take you there easily within 5 minutes. I found the best Garlic naan and chicken tikka.Hawker centres are warm so be ready with a hanky or two."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to try out local fare,negative,30,31-Aug-13,Good place to try out local fare if you stay near orchard. . The fish soup near to the Carpark is great. The rest you can get around the same standard at a cheaper price elsewhere. Be careful of ordering seafood.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average to below average food,negative,30,6-Oct-14,"The centre has a large variety of local cuisine - hawker food and seafood. However the food is slightly over priced compared with other hawker centres, and locals say the reason is due to tourists who frequent the place. We have tried a few different stalls and unfortunately, have not found any stall that provides really good-tasting food. Most food centres in the shopping malls provide better tasting food."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below average food,negative,20,12/25/17,Neither is the menu creative nor are the standard dishes any great. I may have given the place 4 stars had it been in a hawker center but you have different expectations from a Mandarin Hotel restaurant.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing food in a colonial setting ,positive,40,08/20/17,"I usually go to the Long Beach UDMC restaurant so my expectations were high. The food didn't disappoint me, the black pepper crabs were amazing. Whilst waiting for friends to arrive, we had the white bait coated in 7 spices with our beer which was also excellent. Dinner was quite expensive though, S$115 per person.Restaurant is in an old military colonial building and we sat outside on the veranda under a ceiling fan. It was nice but given the choice, I would prefer to be eating by the sea in the East Coast Park.However after dinner, it is possible to visit the Red Dot microbrewery, which is next door."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Pepper and Chili Crab - Charged for the Towelettes and Everything Else,positive,40,09/22/17,"I have eaten at Long Beach before and wanted to have the crabs on this trip too. I ordered a pepper and a chili crab, and some baby kailin. I was charged S$2.00 for the peanuts that they brought to the table, S$1.80 for the rolls and S$0.60 for the towelettes. In the grand scheme of things not a big deal from a monetary perspective, but on a S$200 tab, give me a break. I guess that's how they stay in business and maintain margins, but it is irksome to see on the bill."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lunch ,positive,40,05/24/17,"Well regarded restaurant with excellent Cantonese and Teochew food. Roast meats, teochew braised duck, pomfret fish porridge and yam desserts are exceptional."

French,Saveur,Limited choice of mains,negative,30,26-Jan-18,We wanted to try the roasted chicken breast but it wasn’t available on the day even though there were only a few mains choices available so it was a disappointment. Nonetheless the duck confit dish was ok for the price paid.
French,Paul,Nice environment with nicely done food,positive,40,7-May-18,"It’s a nice environment to enjoy your lunch with your friends. I love the potatoes soup. Light & does not feel starchy at all. The Ham & Cheese Crepe is simple & yummy!! The service is above average. The price is on the high side. However, it’s worth the value. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant experience,positive,40,30-Jul-17,"Had a pleasant experience dining at L'Entrecote. Ordered 3 appetizers (french onion soup, foie gras pâté and escargots) and the XXL portion of steak frites to be shared among us two. The soup was great, foie gras pâté was huge but delectable and the escargots were normal. The steak was tender but we were not fans of their special sauce which was a tad sour for our liking. Ambience and service were great though."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but tricky hawker owners,positive,40,20-Aug-12,Great variety of seafood choices but be sure to at least have a good indication of the prices. Hawkers at Newton Hawker Centre is well trained in tricking tourists into expensive dishes or ridiculous price calculations. A seafood meal for two should not exceed SGD$60.

I just had a Bhatura but tell frankly could not finish it... The only problem i faced was they did not accept travel card saying they accept only on bills above SGD 20 or more and my bill was SGD16.80.. They should think over that policy as i was all alone so there is never be any chances to get it over SGD 20... Shall come again sure next time come to Singapore... :)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Need improvement,positive,50,3-Mar-17,The service need to be improved as well as the order being processed.

This is a franchise and I had previously visited in Canary Wharf. It was perfect for our first night in Singapore, good food with ample portion size. No one else in my party had been to L'Entrecote previously and they were impressed and will return to a home location. The setting is really romantic and the service was fabulous. "

Visited most of the popular jap buffets in singapore and I always find myself coming back to Shin Minori. I love the really great variety of food Shin Minori has to offer and also the freshness of their sashimi and really quick service! They have never missed out a single item on our order as everything was really systematic. In most other japanese buffet restaurants, you have to manually order with the waiter while at SM, you simply order through the ipad reserved for each table. My most recent visit was in May 2017 and I must say I am pleasantly surprised the quality and standard of their food has remained the same (or even better now) compared to my last visit in 2016. I had to ask for several things during the meal such as an extra pair of chopstick and wasabi and despite it being a busy friday dinner time, the staff got me my stuff under less than 5 minutes. Their service here is simply the best!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good food for North Indian Vegetarian,positive,40,18-Apr-14,"Like I had reviewed for MTR as one of the best South Indian Vegetarian place, this is the best place for North Indian food.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Ultimate sushi experience,positive,50,29-Jan-12,"This is a pricey place, so do not gow if 300S$++ per person will make you feel unconfortable.

Can't wait to return."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic food and service ,positive,50,19-Mar-18,"Was recommended to go to Kailash and the recommendation was great. Got seated quickly and didn’t have to wait long to get served. Initially there were only 2 of us but a friend joined us, no problem having the table extended even though they were busy. The food was very tasty and amazing, fully vegetarian in case you didn’t realise. You can order beer and wine. Good sized potions with amazing flavour. We would all definitely go back. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glad I went...! ,positive,40,2-Nov-15,"This place is expensive! The food was great and very well presented. Some amazing produce cooked to perfection. The restaurant itself is a little impersonal. We were in a 2 and had to share our kitchen with another pair. It was a bit awkward and quiet. Wine by the glass menu was a bit limited, but had some good choices. The special of the night was a couple of dishes using white truffle which was out of this world. Not sure I'd go back, given the price but I'm glad I went."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food Great, Service Poor",negative,30,2-Feb-17,The food was very good and the alarm Carter buffet electronic ordering system easy. However when the food was delivered the server just abruptly dropped the plate at the edge of the table and did not make an effort to place it between the diners. Also clearing plates after they were finished was not done in a timely manner. Nor was the free-flow tea refreshed when the glass was empty.

French,Paul,Defines horrendous,negative,10,1-Jan-17,"This local franchise of the ubiquitous French chain is truly horrendous. Known in France for reliable quality fare, here the brand is going to hell. Firstly, the service is slow and gives new meaning to the word inattentive. A table next to us was heard speculating if they should just leave without paying because getting a bill was taking so long. We also waited forever to be served and to receive our orders, all at a time when the place was far from busy. Then there's what passes for food -- soggy inedible macarons, a moelleux that was stale, hard and dry (the antithesis of the meaning of the cake), and one of the worst cappuccino's I've ever had (how does one mess this up!?), I could go on... It's hard to put a finger on what exactly is wrong here. Is it lack of proper management, is it a belief that a well known brand can prevail over thoroughly mediocre product? Whatever it is, the succession of accurate and bad reviews here should be a wake up call to pull up their socks. And prices are not exactly bon marché. All it has going for it is the location and view."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good jap food,positive,50,3-Feb-17,"Lovely food and good service :)

My family members like the chat items particularly pani puri, bhel puri and dhahi puri. Other items like naan, roti plus subzi are also Occasionally because of peak time food service takes a beating but yet tasty enough. Staff are generally ok but can be more customer oriented and smiling. Overall a good place for vegetarians. They have another branch opp Mustafa entry 2."

Their curry is simply brilliant and easily on a par if not better with michelin starred curry houses I have visited in London. this guy really deserves all the praise he gets. We're repeat customers and currently working our way down the menu. inexpensive and consistently delicious, it's the best place i've eaten at in Singapore. top notch!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best fish head curry,negative,30,15-Feb-14,This was on my first day in Singapore - went there due to a recommendation and ordered the fish head curry because she never lets me down. Fabulous!!!!!The only downside was that when we went it was almost empty. Granted it was a Sunday around noon - I didn't think ahead about the time of day. It would have been nice to see it busy with all the venders open.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quality Japanese Buffet,positive,50,8-Nov-16,"First of all, first of this buffet is not cheap, so it might not be the ideal place if you are tight on budget. That said, the buffet price is < $50 after GST & Service charge, with a HUGE variety of japanese food, from classic sushi, sashimi (Salmon, Ika, Maguro, Taco, EVEN FREE-FLOW HAMACHI HOLY), handrolls, to grilled food, cooked food, udon, etc. The chefs are very generous with servings (sashimi was thick and juicy), so you do not have to constantly reorder. They use ipad to order so it is very convenient. Overall, a great place to indulge and satisfy your Japanese food cravings once in a while."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good food of Indian taste,positive,40,3-Oct-14,Eat Sea food at Muthu's curry than Chicken and all other stuff. If you are RCI platinum Plus member please don't ask for discount as promised by Dining Plus you will get frustating treatment which is annoying.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food,positive,40,21-Dec-16,A lot of variety of food to choose from the menu for the buffet. Service staff very helpful and friendly.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Couldn't better the steak,positive,50,14-Feb-16,"Lovely setting, excellent service, food was very tasty and well cooked, my very rare fillet steak melted in the mouth. Dessert options good and were well worth having"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",it's opp Mustafa-not Pulau Bin,negative,30,27-Jan-15,"The address given on tripadvisor is wrong. As far as the Restaurent is concerned it's pure veg and the food is not bad, but it's other branch (10 mins walk from this branch) is much better.If you decide to eat here, try Chholw Bhature, Pani Puri, Samosa Chaat, Dahi Bhalla, Sev Puri and Bhel puri in that order of preference. Apple mint and lassi are good as drinks. Desserts are not great."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food and service, but staff appeared overwhelmed by manpower shortage",positive,40,2-Apr-17,"Good food and service, but staff appeared overwhelmed by the manpower shortage. Frequency of receiving out orders was also a little inconsistent."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase-Wow,positive,50,26-Sep-16,"One of the top 5 dining experiences I have had. A Michelin star should tell you what you need to know and this restaurant is as good as the the top Omakase restaurants in Ginza.Chef Ishizawa presents and endless flow of fresh Japanese delicacies over about a 2 hour period. I am not a huge sea urchin (Uni) fan but Chef presented several types from Hokkaido and I was amazed.The grilled tuna was also out of this world as Chef selects a heavily marbled cut and the fish is tender and juicy throughout.One caution: If you have to ask about pricing, this is not your restaurant."
French,L_Angelus,Living on its reputation!,negative,20,23-Mar-15,"No restaurant can afford to rest on its laurels and unfortunately, that is precisely what this one is doing. The restaurant occupies a position in the centre of Club Street that after 7pm at the weekend becomes one of the hippest areas of the city. When we entered this quaint French Bistro style restaurant we left our entire feel good factor on the pavement of Club Street as the restaurant was completely lacking in atmosphere. There was very little energy among the staff and it felt boring. The standard of cooking was mixed; the starters were good however both the Duck Confit and the Sausage Cassoulet were overcooked. I expected a melt-in-the-mouth duck confit with succulent meat encased in a crispy skin instead; I received overcooked dry and chewy duck - dreadful! After waiting fifteen minutes for our plates to be removed, the waitress came to top up our wine glasses and we had to ask for our table to be cleared. We said the food was overcooked but the waitress, whom we discovered was the manager, would not accept any criticism. We asked for the bill and when paying we were saying we were disappointed with both the food and the service. However, the worst service was yet to come as I had to ask the waitress (manager!) to stop clearing the table next to us when my husband was paying the bill and she was still talking to him - absolutely appalling service! The staff appears to have forgotten that they are actually there to serve the customer. Club Street has so much more to offer than this."
French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian Chocolate Style,positive,50,16-Feb-17,It's a must place to visit for a chocolate lover. Too bad I have to fly over to Singapore first for everytime I'm craving of the mont blanc dessert. But I will definitely spare my time to visit this place again when I got the chance to visit singapore. Can't wait to go back!!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",birthday month promotion visit :),positive,50,26-Aug-17,Loved this buffet promotion and the food tasted great and value for $. Order food via ipad is fast and efficient indeed :)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of my favourite hawker centres,positive,40,14-Sep-13,I first discovered this hawker centre the first time I came to Singapore and it's still just as good value and has such a wide variety of food as it ever had! Just a short walk from the Newton MRT station! Thoroughly recommended to all visitors to Singapore!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best indian restaurant,positive,50,25-Feb-16,The best place to have Indian food when you are in Singapore. The food here is lip-smacking and also with the budget.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Can not understand the hype about it!,negative,10,26-Feb-14,"I arrived alone in the evening around 8pm, got a table pretty quick.Did not like it though as it was of course under a aircon duct, but no other choice so I accepted.Then the waiting started... tables around me started to get filled and orders were taken.I was left aside, after 10 minutes they took my order too. Staff is very very unprofessional and my waiter had missing teeth... eeeehhh? Please who hired him to serve in a restaurant... OMG.I ordered the large entrecôte, medium. Arrived after 15 minutes. Fries were almost cold and the meat only a little warmer.Did not want to complain as I was hungry. The meat was ok but thats it. Fries as well...Sauce, whats the hype about this sauce? Every house made béarnese sauce is better. The house wine at 10 SGD is a rip off, well okay as wine in Singapore in general. Asked for the check and got more money back than supposed to.Okay I accepted with a smile and went away. The cashier takes the total amount of the bottom, which is the total of the bill... The due change is somehow in the middle. Hope thats not their rule otherwise the owners will not be happy.Would I recommend? Well if you like a fast food steak yes, if you like quality no.Its comparable to the lousy steaks of Outback in Singapore. Anyways what happened to Outback? They were top dollar some years ago..."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh!,positive,40,20-Nov-14,Fresh with plenty of seasonal fish to choose from which is great! The service is good and the place has a nice atmosphere!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A inviting and exquisite experience,positive,50,23-Feb-18,"After trying Kanesaka in Tokyo, I was stoked to find out there was one in Singapore, and offering cheaper options. The chef recommended we take the $125 course if we liked uni (originally we came for the $75), and we were not disappointed! The chef we had was jovial and friendly, and it's apparent the chef has loyal regulars by the way they interact, which is good to see! We we in a smaller room, but it didn't detract from the experience. I would definitely take others there the next time! Quality of the food almost as good as the Tokyo Palace Hotel branch!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good timsum variety.,negative,30,05/13/14,"Enjoyed the timsum. But in terms of service, it has a lot to be done. Atmosphere can be further improve too."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Desserts were great but steak is so-so,negative,30,29-Aug-18,"Steak was so-so, sauce was lovely and escargots too. Best were the desserts! The caramel lava cake was heavenly. Service was sparse, hard to get their attention."
French,Saveur,Straightforward and Enjoyable,positive,50,24-Jan-17,"Saveur makes French food affordable while offering great taste. The dinner sets included appetizers, main dishes and desserts, which were appealing, but we ultimately chose to order a la carte entrees and shared appetizers because of the discount from an e-voucher we used. Also, located on the first floor of The Cathay facing the street makes this restaurant easy to find. Plus, the wait staff were so friendly and helpful in answering our questions."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",TOURISTIC AND EXPENSIVE,negative,20,16-Mar-12,The food is so so and expensive. The stallholders tend to serve the tourists better than the locals.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Comfort. Food.,positive,40,4-Sep-16,"I have eaten here six times in the last three years. When I visit Singapore I try a lot east Asian food, but after a few nights of eating with chopsticks, this Punjabi has to have some North Indian food and eat with his hands. The menu is very extensive, but I have only tried four things: samosa chaat; pani puri; chole + masala bhatura; ras malai. It's what I crave: comfort food from childhood. Maybe next time I will try something else. They do all of them very well. Restaurant is very clean and bright compared to most of the Indian restaurants in Little India. I will be back next time."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service but delicious meal,negative,30,07/17/10,"We went here on our last day in Singapore. We were staying in Chinatown and wanted something from a restaurant so we could sit down. Service was absolutely shocking.They use a button system where you push a button when you are ready to order, want more water or want the bill. Good luck getting them at any other time. And my waitress was very cranky and spoke no english whatsoever. But.... our meal was good. Sizzling beef and sweet and sour pork, rice and chinese tea came to around $45 sgd, not cheap for chinatown but the food was tasty. Pity about everything else though"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food,positive,50,19-Mar-17,"Great, clean hawker center that is easily accessible via the MRT. Great food, a little pricier than some other centers. I'd say this one is one more tourists go to."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Wow - how do they make lamb chops taste that good,positive,50,22-Dec-14,"I just had pineapple Lamb chops here, the texture and the flavour were out of this world. I could have eaten 6 or more. Excellent spicing made them the best I have ever eaten. Good garlic naans and sheekkebabs on the side made the whole...More"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Enjoyed the South Indian...,negative,30,6-Dec-08,Enjoyed the South Indian fare
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Do not visit if you want to eat good Chaat and Pani Puri.,negative,20,3-Jul-16,"Went to the Belilios Road outlet(there's another one on syed alwi road) today for some Chaat, Paani Puri and Desserts. The puri for the paani puri tasted oily and stale and the same for chaat platter. Complained to the waiter about it but no one really cared. The desserts were good. The only highlight of the trip. The main course probably tastes better and is probably the reason for it's popularity but I'd give it a miss otherwise."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated!,negative,30,01/20/16,"Before today I had only ordered takeaway char siew which was nice and tender but expensive @ $15.90 for 11 small slices. Not sure that it was worth it. I had also ordered the black pepper duck buns (all good - moist, tender duck, soft bun - except maybe a bit too much of the black pepper).Today I had a late lunch in the restaurant. By the way, they have taken additional space (see photo). Had duck noodles and warm barley. Duck was tender, skin not crispy at all. I had to remove the fat but alas the skin came off too. Barley was not even warm. Waiters and Waitresses in Singapore food outlets have a problem understanding 'hot', 'warm' & 'luke warm'.So my conclusion is that it is not 'die, die must eat'."
French,Saveur,SAVEUR @ CATHAY,positive,40,27-Feb-17,Good value for money food . One of the best pork belly dish ever tasted ! Will definitely be back again !
Chinese,London Fat Duck,One of the Best Roast Duck,positive,40,05/30/16,"London Fat Duck is definitely one of the best Roast Duck restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity.
They have nice menu and most of the food are high standard"
French,Angelina_MBS,A must in Singapore for Gluten Free,positive,50,16-Aug-15,"It’s a little on the expensive side, but we had a wonderful dinner. Staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free. All in all it was a good experience."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Ambience. Great food. Worth the money spent.,positive,50,27-Apr-17,"When ever I visit Singapore, I go there for sure for lunch / dinner that too more than once. The food is to my liking (not too spicy) and the taste is good. The Jaipur pulav is tasty. Their sandwiches are also good to have."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Good Buffet!,positive,40,6-Feb-12,"The restaurant is conveniently located close to the Clarke Quay MRT stop, and has a good spread during the lunch and dinnner buffets. Plenty of choices for both veg/non-vegetarians."
French,Paul,"Food as tad salty, but otherwise super yummy",positive,50,3-May-17,"My husband & I visited because of a promotion. I thought Paul's is more famous for its patisserie, but boy, was I wrong! I tried the lamb rack, bone marrow and escargot. They are perfect! The lamb is well marinated, a bit salty but very delicious. The bone marrow & escargot are perfect! My hubby tried the tenderloin. It's not too bad, but not as great as the rest. The atmosphere is quite good on a weekday, not too crowded - but maybe that's why there is a promotion. The service is also quite good. I'm totally visiting again real soon!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,positive,40,09/29/12,"Nice Chinese restaurant.
They have good dim sum, chilli crab even. Best thing is they have delivery service."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quintessential Singapore Chilli Crab at 31 Heng Heng BBQ,positive,50,7-Jul-16,"Took the train to Newton station to have chilli crab on our last day, had to be done. Getting of the train you come out by a roundabout in a nothing looking part of town. Thanks to Google maps for showing the way as it looked like there was nothing there. After locating the area, a triangle of seating and small cooking shacks we went around to view the variety on display. We decided on 31 Heng Heng BBQ. The place was spotlessly clean and the crabs were top quality, heavy and fresh. We ordered a $38 crab and some fried rice. What can I say but it was the best crab I have had, so much meat it easily fed two of us. The sauce was medium hot but you could go either way by request. Highly Recommended."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinning Experience,positive,40,28-Mar-17,"The Dinning was wonderful as we were usher to a smaller room. However, it was too close to the kitchen, hence it was a bit noisy."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the prawns!,negative,30,20-Apr-14,"My husband and I decided to go to Newtons Circus for local cheap food for dinner while in Singapore tonight. I had a $5 meal, and he decided to have the garlic prawns recommended by a nice little old lady saying ""hmm yum yum"". On presentation it looked fantastic. Looked more like lobster than prawns. Four of them. When it came to paying we thought she was saying $16 for prawns and fried rice. Turns out it was $16 for EACH prawn making a grand total of $64!!!!!!! Apparently they go by weight......so when ordering garlic prawns (yum yum), ask the price FIRST! Not the cheapest meal ever :/"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum,positive,50,10/3/2015,"Probably the best dim sum in my admittedly limited experience. I like that its a little hidden, up some stairs and around a corner (though not hard to find), making it feel like a respite from the busy touristy street below. There was a healthy mix of tourists and locals, and no question as to the authenticity. Prices are very reasonable. Service is a little business-like, but not unfriendly and frankly that seems the norm at dim sum places. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety,positive,40,21-Jun-14,"A must visit when in Singapore. Tried the garlic prawns, Singapore chilli crab, satay, fried rice and the food was spectacular."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",ah! the spices of great indian food!.. excellent Fish head curry,positive,40,2-Apr-13,"Went and ordered Fish head curry, mutton sukha, black daal, pepper mushroom...
the fish head curry was just out of this world!.... mutton sukha and pepper mushroom was great!... black daal (or daal makhni) was average....
and the surprise was the 'vegetables' they give as...More"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointed - average at best,negative,30,11/12/2016,"We booked this restaurant for tonight 12th November when we were in England based on the great reviews on here that also determined that we would stay at the hotel.We booked for 930 as we were arriving from Jakarta. Arriving at the restaurant we were kept waiting while they found a table. I'm guessing there must have been a worse one., but we were tucked in the corner next to the servers station - dirty plates and other dishes a glorious sight!!The food was okay but we were rushed - perhaps the proximity of 1030 and the closing time of the restaurant was to blame.The servers were not attentive and the ambience of which others have spoken was non existent. We could barely make ourselves heard over the clattering of plates and dishes as they tidied and prepared the tables for the next day.There was nothing special about the meal - equally as good food can found in other restaurants.A huge disappointment"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good ambiance, expected more",negative,30,30-Dec-14,"Had lunch here on recommendations of a few friends. On ask in the waiter for the specials, he insisted all the items were special. Either he did not know what a special was or there wasn't one in the first place. The food was generally very good. We wanted to try Sindhi food and since our waiter wasn't particularly helpful we ordered foods with Sindhi on its name. Eat here if you know which Sindhi food you want to try out."
French,Poulet,Best Poultry Meal,positive,50,13-Aug-14,"Together with my wife and daughter we had great, delicious and affordable lunch @ Poulet.

With the new dish introduced, it gives the menu even more choice and makes me want to come more !"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap frequented by locals,negative,30,30-Jun-15,"While not how it was in it's hayday, the food quality and value are exceptional on different ends of the spectrum. Food is excellent and fresh but you could get the same dishes for 25% of the price from other more local hawkers. I would recommend this as a stop for tourists, but not a replacement for Little India or China Town. Be sure to wash down your meal with large Tiger."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is so so but very slow in serving, lost our orders several times",negative,10,13-Aug-18,Very hard for us to visit this place another time because our multiple orders at repeated times were lost.

Will prefer to go to Whampoa hawker centre or Maxwell market"
French,L_Angelus,Unbelievable,positive,50,21-Oct-11,"Verdict: This place takes the top spot for the best food experience I’ve ever encountered. My main meal was fantastic and the dessert topped things off. Fortunately, I got to eat a reasonable portion of my cousin’s creme brullee which was absolutely amazing. He too thoroughly enjoyed his mains, wine, and dessert. Look past the price tag, this place is a must try. At least come in for the creme brullee. Please!Price: ExpensiveTaste: DeliciousValue: ExcellentRecommendation: Highly Recommend"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average place,negative,30,01/26/17,The food is average. But unfortunately the service is lacking. They might need to train the non-chinese speaking staff to take orders better as they didnt get my order correct the first time.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore,positive,40,16-May-14,"Have eaten here 3 times. Love love the steak and fries. Not the best steak I've ever had but still very tasty. Portions are huge especially after they come with seconds. Love the buzz, ambience and décor of this restaurant. It is ideal for a group of friends to meet up for a weekend dinner. Wouldn't recommend for a couple as the tables are very very close together so lack of privacy."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,'OUT OF SHAPE' DUMPLING,negative,30,6/2/2014,Visited the restaurant at Dhoby Ghaut 1 wk ago..Very disappointed with their dumpling..its not tasty and the glutinous rice is so soggy..it does not have the shape of a dumpling when opened..the rice is drooping and the ingredients esp the meat is not tasty.. Really not worth the money..Selling at $5.80!
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Inedibles at les bouchons ,negative,10,3-Mar-14,"I ordered lamb kebabs and friends ordered steaks. A friend (French) complained his steak was overdone and an Asian friend complained her steak was overdone but their steak was still edible as they asked for rare and they gave them medium. My lamb was over done as well, I asked for medium. Also The lamb kebabs had big nerves that made eating it unpleasant as can't chew on the nerves. All the fries served were brown and inedible. A total let down.. They have a French floor manager who is absolutely friendly and nice but he has to be tough with his kitchen to reject food that looks inedible if no one cares and customers feedback! Definitely a place where I am not sure if anyone takes pride in their work.. What a pity. It has a decent bistro feel. Don't attempt , not worth it. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Flambeed Chicken but advanced order required,positive,40,04/22/18,New Chef Edward Chong has some strong signature dishes which require advanced orders: Tomahawk steak done Xinjiang style (3 days advance order required) and flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine (1 day advance order).Winning dish: flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine is a must try!Other noteworthy dishes:Prawns with passion fruit sauce was succulent with a good bite and refreshing sweet sour passion fruit flavours. Beef short rib with truffle oil & black pepper was excellent with tender Wagyu beef & a fragrant truffle nose. Tofu with lala has a nice “Wok Hei”flavour. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Just a gathering of old friends ,positive,40,30-Nov-17,"We are a group of 4 old school pals meeting up for dinner. This place was offered quite a good spread for an ala carte buffet! You get sashimi and sushi, tempura and some meat dish too. They also have noodles like soba and udon. Overall it’s a very good deal if you like JAPANESE food. Don’t expect fine dining but I’ll say that they are above average. I’d definitely return another day!! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food and Service,positive,40,24-Sep-18,"I would recommend this place for authentic Indian Chaats. My personal favourite in KP is Vada Pav and Pani Puri. And the lassi here is just delicious. Sandwiches are quite tasty, but they seem to be a little on the dry end for me. The staffs are quite friendly and helpful. Overall an excellent place to relish some Indian foods in a budget friendly way."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A nice spot for hawker,negative,30,29-May-13,"The food here is not bad, there are many choices around but it seems to be centred towards seafood. Be warned though, the seafood stall people will definitely pester you to order from their stalls. Be firm."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Delicious Hot Idly ... love it !!,positive,50,5-May-18,"I visited the Little India branch in Singapore. Just loved the taste specially when served with podi !!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable buffet,positive,40,28-Aug-18,Good variety of buffet. Fresh sashimi was good. Delivery of certain items can be slow but overall great place.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet Lunch,negative,30,2-Nov-16,80% of items are rice/noodles. Sashimi was fresh but always served last. Mentaiko spaghetti was bad.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Original and best ,positive,50,06/20/16,Not many words required. Just go. Order the black pepper crab. It's simply delicious. Messy. But delicious. Don't bother with napkins. Get stuck in and just wash your hands in the basins later. Enjoy.
French,Paul,Mediocre pastry and service,negative,30,9-Mar-14,"Having heard raves and good reviews about Paul's Bakery and always seeing the long queues, we were eager to try it, thinking that it must have been very impressive. However, our first experience left us with much to be desired.After a tough mental battle between Hot Chocolate and Tea Gourmand, I decided on the latter, which came with three pieces of Macorons as well. While I sipped my hot tea, I nibbled on the a-tad-too-sweet macarons, glad to be able to swallow the saccharine tiny cookie-like pastries easier.No worries there, the tea and macarons were not the highlight anyway. We patiently awaited our tarts to be served.I had the Chocolate Tartlette- a small name for a rather good-sized pastry. The crust was solid and not crumbly like how some tarts fall apart the moment it is put to the fork's test. The chocolate was .... nondescript? There was no rich strong aroma of good chocolate or the bittersweet-ness of my favorite dark chocolate; the taste was pleasant, but nothing that blew me away. It was a rather normal chocolate tart, in my humble opinion.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/tea-at-pauls-bakery.html"
French,L_Angelus,You can't have both the food and the service bad. Must choose one!,negative,10,17-Aug-11,"Both the service and the food are well below par.Service: what's the point of putting tables outside if you're not going to to station a waiter outside? I had to walk in to ask for our bill!Food: I've had better beef cuts at hooters! Super premium prices for cheap beef cuts, overpriced everything. Meat under cooked. (asked for medium rare, got a cow that talked back to me)Overall, no reason to go back there with so many great choices in Singapore."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak and fries - don't miss their Beaujolais Nouveau party,positive,40,17-Oct-15,"Well-priced French steak and frites, Les Bouchons also throws the best Beaujolais Nouveau party on the river!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food and value for money,positive,40,30-Oct-17,"This is my second visit to the restaurant. After my first visit , the experience was good and decided to bring my family down for a meal since it was my daughter birthday as well. The food was well portion as instruction was clear on the ipad on how many piece was served. The sashimi was fresh and we all enjoyed our self. Will definitely be back in the future."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sublime beyond all expectations,positive,50,24-Aug-14,"The food here is beyond anything I've experienced anywhere in the world, and yes, I've eaten a lot of places! It brings a new meaning to 'fresh' with the base flavours of the main components standing tall, but perfectly complimented by subtle, beautiful flavourings. The sea urchin is incredible. The beef tastes like you could cut it with a spoon. I am dreaming still about the chocolate truffles we finished with. The matched wines and sake were excellent, although the wines were very familiar ones for us as Australians. Unlike the previous reviewer who didn't like the 'hibachi' style seating, we were ok with that because it is still intimate and serious service. There is no Benihana style theatrics in preparation or service. When I expressed interest in the grill (which is actually a very clever induction plate not a Benihana style grill) the chef explained how it all worked and, because I was interested, took me out the back and showed me around the kitchen. Service was unobtrusive and perfectly timed. Yes, we moved to the lounge for dessert, but then lingered over some very excellent Pedro Ximinez while admiring the view, which was a lovely way to finish."
French,Paul,Terrible Sevice,negative,10,13-Jun-18,"Went here for a breakfast and coffee, both were ok. But the service was terrible, one waitress appeared to be actively avoiding and ignoring customers. They seemed completely disorganised. Every person that came in after us had to ask to be served, will never go there again. "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The real deal,positive,40,29-Mar-17,"The real deal, as it has been for decades. Close to the city, and Newton MRT. Busy with locals and expats. What impressed me was the freshness and quality of the seafood at a range of outlets -lobster, bugs(sometimes labelled as crayfish, sometimes as lobster-we know them as Balmain Bugs), stingray, tiger prawns. Adam Liaw recommended Stall 27, and the stingray with sambal didn't disappoint. Especially with a cold bottle of Tiger."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great service and fresh food,positive,50,30-Jan-14,"Booked a lunch with my family here. Great email communications. Welcomed by 5 staff when arriving. Great to see Shinji preparing and overseeing the chef to deliver the nice lunch. Chosen the basic set menu thinking that we will need to have afternoon tea after this at Raffles as the menu only listed as 9 pieces of shushi. I was wrong, they keep on coming with extra appetizers and dessert and we were all full. Manager was very helpful and even give us suggestions for Chicken rice nearby. Seeing the chef meticulously preparing for every piece is really great."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Best Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce,positive,40,10/11/2015,Excellent taste of Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce. One of best in Singapore in addition to the Signature London Roast Duck. Queue is more than 30 mins but it is worth it. Black pepper London Duck Bun is another great choice. The duck and pork are so juicy. Better come earlier to avoid long queue.
French,Saveur,affordable and delicious french cuisine,positive,40,6-Mar-17,We have eaten here many times with friends and colleagues who are visiting because it is at a convenient location. Food and service is always reliably good and they have affordable set lunches and dinners with portions that are a good value for french cuisine in singapore.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over Hype Average Food,negative,30,7/5/2015,"LFD is not related to the Four Seasons Restaurant in London and also has nothing to do with the Fat Duck in UK. Instead the ducks were claimed to be Irish. It is only a typical Hong Kong style Cantonese restaurant.Although the shop names emphasised on duck, you can also find many others Hong Kong style dim sum, wanton noodle and etc. The roast ducks is nice but not fantastically nice. The ducks served was fat and juicy. On the other hand the Honey sauced Char Siew is surprisingly good. Fat but not greasy. We didn't get to try the roast pork. The other dim sum and dumpling that we had ordered are actually quite authentically Hong Kong that you can find it in any Hong Kong street stalls.The time we visited the restaurant was on a Saturday evening and long queue had already formed and we have to wait for 50 mins to get our table. By the time our turn was up at 8pm, many items on the menu had been sold out.The pricing of the food is at mid range and mostly appropriately priced except the white rice that cost us SGD2.50 per bowl which is outrageous.Verdict is the food is good, price is reasonable and location is good so we don't mind coming back again if the waiting time can be shorter."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Crabs were great, but service not so much",negative,30,03/25/13,"Went to this highly rated establishment, and as the crabs were tasty, we couldn't get service once our dishes were delivered. We asked for extra napkins as the dishes are quite messy, and she acknowledged with a nod but that was the last we saw of her. They neglect to tell tourists that EVERYTHING is EXTRA as we found out when the bill arrived. The dish of peanuts they bring when you sit down, the wet napkins they give you, and the bread with the crab dishes are all unexpected charges! Then we find out that there is a sink with paper towels in the middle of the restaurant outside that regulars are obviously aware of, but no, we ask for extra napkins and get charged! If I'm paying that much for the crabs, I at least expect better service. "

French,Saveur,"Food is good, a pity no birthday special for customer visiting them on actual day of birthday.",positive,40,9-Jun-16,"We love the yummy food and it's presentation. We love their desserts too. The ambience is a bit cold, lighting too dark, we visited them on a rainy day for lunch. Too dark to even take picture nicely. Maybe lighting not enough, need to call the staff a few times to get their attention. The staff are otherwise friendly and nice. We love their food but it will be a plus point if they could improve on hospitality. For customers visiting them on their birthday, it will be really nice if they could even give a slice of cake or a special drink on the house. Well, I'm just suggesting. Maybe at night the place will be more romantic with it's dark setting. My visit at Saveur on evening is more pleasant.I will visit again and look forward to an improve ambience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Truly Cantonese Cuisine,positive,40,01/22/18,Had lunch with some friends yesterday (21 Jan 2018) and had Dim Sum with some other dishes. There were 7 of us and the bill came to around $420. Seems pricey just for a dim sum lunch. However food was good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-hyped.,negative,20,4/8/2016,"With all the rave about the ""Wagyu of Duck"", I decided to try it out for myself. Let's start with the food. To be honest, the duck tasted pretty average to me. I personally prefer their Char Siew better than the Roasted Duck (and my girlfriends agreed too). Besides that, the rest of the dishes are alright. I won't say it's fantastic or like out-of-this-world. But if you do head down and try, do try their Duck Bun and Egg Tarts. That I recommend. Be warned though. With the expected waiting time (since they just opened and everyone wants a piece of their duck), the place was a little messy and chaotic. The plus point for them for our night there is the lovely wait-staff who was assisting us (just that one nice auntie) and that the food came almost instantaneously.Now, I can say ""I've been there, done that."""

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good yummy food,negative,30,7-Jul-16,Great foodLots of options to choose. Hara bara kebab was very yummy. Naan and side dish gravies were very yummy and perfectly cooked. Pani puri was very hard. Dahi puri Dahi was veri veri frozen cold.Should less oil in the gravies. Naan and chapattis tasted great. Waitress was annoying .We ordered 7 chapathis and she kept on annoying are you going to eat all or any of your Friends coming or you going to pack food for home.Which was quiet irritating and no manners.They should better teach the waitress who takes order to stop asking nonsense to customers. There are people who eat lot and 7 chapathis are not too much for 2 people. Finally food was great and she was not harsh and other people were friendly and neat clean ambience. But her way of questioning was annoying and it's none of her business to question us on are we going to eat all or pack or ordering for friends.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exemplary Service,positive,40,04/24/16,"A family dinner to celebrate a birthday, and the food was exceptional + service was commendable.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Serving timing need improvement ,negative,30,11-May-16,"Visited on 11thMay2015 with my mother for lunch buffet,where I got an 1 for 1 as I using The Entertainer App. Reached 12pm.As my 1st time here so not sure,which I could ordered. Luckily, there was this lady,she guided me all the way and answered my many questions.Like its garlic fried rice,fried chicken chunks,potato salad,etc...Every items is in small portion,for example 1pc per serving. So when we ordered must take note of the serving size. And find the serving timing is slow,might be restaurant 95% full during lunch time.Overall, beside finding that they should speed up their serving time of each dishes as not only my table but others tables also waited quite long time. Another is their serving portion is too small but menu photo shown is like 2 or 4 per item. But can add on items without extra charge as is buffet. Will still visit as this 1 for 1 deal is great.Would like to compliment the lady wearing black blouse,she always stand at reception,she is patient to all my wonders. Spend $47.08 for 2 as I ordered hot green tea × 2=$3(no drink included in the buffet).The lunch buffet is $37 per pax before tax."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always a good atmosphere ,positive,40,11-Jul-15,Newton might have a reputation of being a more touristy hawker place but so long as you don't mind paying a few extra dollars it's a great place to go. Good selection of stalls (Indian palace is our fave) and they bring the dishes to your table. So no walking around and waiting for numerous different meals for the family. We like!!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Overpiced for what it si,negative,20,10-Jul-15,"Don't think it's worth to spend this much money on sushi. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just way overpriced. There are plenty of other options for great sushi in Singapore to spend your money on/"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Underwhelming.....,negative,20,15-Feb-15,"I previousy had lunch at Shinji (Raffles Hotel) and it was a good experience. Hence my wife and I were looking forward to our dinner in Shinji. The welcome and initial impression was good and was as expected. After ordering our drinks, we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait.Eventually I figured out that there was an event going on in the private room next door. The chef serving us our omakase dinner was apparently tasked to prepare the food for them. So when we sat down at 7.45pm, and finished 2 beers and 1 bottle of sake, after 30 minutes - the appetizer arrived.My first piece of sushi arrived at 9.30pm and by then, the guests next to us and us as well, were getting a little hungry - just a wee bit. All through this time, our sushi chef could not talk to us as he was just too busy. In fact he did not even top up the preserved ginger. Which was terrible because that was all I was able to eat for the previous 45 minutes.And the dinner really started at 10pm (when the private room has finished eating), and that's when he served the 2nd piece of sushi - lucky us!!The dinner finished by 10.30pm. While the sushi and quality of food was top notch, I think that the pace of dinner is NOT acceptable. Jiro in Tokyo would have finished the entire meal in 45 minutes. All in all, it was quite an unpleasant experience.I should think if there is an event that the restaurant cannot cope, don't take further reservation. I guess in future, if you want attentiveness as part of your meal here, be sure to be very rich and book the private room. If not, be prepared to feel distinctly second class. Either that or perhaps order the most expensive omakase (mine was the ""middling level"" omaskase), perhaps then you may be deemed worthy of their attention. Good sushi though...no, actually excellent sushi. What a pity."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Brilliant birthday lunch!,positive,50,30-Mar-17,"Shin Minori is one of my favourite go-to Jap places and since it was introduced to me three birthdays ago, I have made it a birthday special every year.

We complained and were offered a complimentary dessert which we did not want.

We are regulars at Peach Blossom and has been for past 5 years. The standard of food has always been consistent. Even when we host dinners with more than 30 people.

Their chats specially the Pani Puri are amazing other than the Pani Puri we will often indulge in their mouth watering Bhel puri, Samosa Chat or Alu Chat as a snack. The Chilly Paneer is also a special favourite.The helpings are large so you should share your food so that you get to taste a variety of their delicate chats and sweets. Wash it down with a cool lassi or lime juice or lime soda and that's what I would call a lovely indian snack.Meals at Kailash Parbat are excellent too and if you have the time do take the time to enjoy a good meal at Little India. The have a new outlet in the works at Changi coming up soon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi and sushi,negative,30,7-Jan-17,"Pros:Sashimi cuts were clean and texture of fish was good. Sushis were quite appetising like fried california roll and the eel with cheese ones. However, sadly no salmon belly or aburi unlike Ikoi (another jap buffet). Cons:Most fried food like sashimo and gyoza is not nice. Both of these were underdone and gyoza was too oily. Service was slow (I understand that as the place was almost filled) but towards the end, we sat for about an hour chatting and some items we ordered did not even come. Overall, would only recommend this place for sushi and sashimi. Definitely not the best buffet like what people voted. "

The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays.The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Maybe it was a bad day... but bad bad bad,negative,10,1/10/2016,"I saw this restaurant on a list of the top 10 Dim Sum restaurants, and was excited to try... in short very disappointing. It could have been a really bad day for the restaurant, and maybe a one off, but I felt that the review needed to go forward in the hope that there is some way the management can learn from it.We were the first in the restaurant on this Sunday morning, and we quickly settled in to ordering from the a la carte buffet. The most basic items they had on hand on the tray they brought to our table, but when we ordered off the menu, this is where all the problems began. We actually waited 90 minutes for our orders to come out, and with three small kids, this was not an ideal situation. At this point, other tables which came to the restaurant almost an hour after our arrival, started receiving food that we had ordered, and yet... still nothing for us.At this point I asked one of the staff where our orders had gone, and the staff just said they would check on it. Still no answer or anyone came back, so I called for the manager. Finally when the manager made time for us, he told us that the computer system had got jammed up and the orders weren't coming through. It would appear that they didn't think telling anyone they screwed up was in order. Shame they couldn't use something more advanced, like a piece of paper and a pen.So... finally after multiple complaints, the food started to arrive. One order which was mean to be Lobster in a Cheese Sauce, turned out to be lobster in a basic canned nacho cheese, this felt like it completely ruined that lobster. Then when we got the beef, it was way undercooked, and all gristle.Finally the biggest insult was that we had a friend who avoided pork due to her faith, and because if this I ordered roast duck, and then for my kids roast pork, which I made as two separate orders. They then decided that because they were way over time, they put the two items together on the same plate. When they brought it our, I explained that there was a reason why I separated the two orders. The waiter's suggestion was then to put the existing dish on two separate plates... I almost fell off my chair.I really wanted to love this place, I was excited, and my wife can tell you how much I wanted to come... but really.... very very very bad experience."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Kailash Parbat,positive,40,3-Feb-15,"On a recent trip to singapore i discovered KP as i call it and had to visit and check out the Chaats.We went to the one opposite Mustafa store as it was easy to park in Mustafa. We got a table straight away. We ordered starters of Dahi Batata Puri, Ragda patties and Hara Bhara Kabab.All of the them were well made. The patties was very big.Followed by North Indian main meal which was Chole bhatura, navratan karma and some paneer sabzi. Nice food. Worth a visit if you are in the mood for Chaat."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent service justifies the price premium,positive,50,1/10/2016,We had lunch buffet and weren't particularly impressed by the menu initially. But we were pleasantly surprised by the food quality! It was a full house yet the service was immaculate. Service manager Mr Terry deserved special mention for his prompt and detailed attention to our needs despite a relatively overwhelming crowd turnout that afternoon. He remembered every fine detail that my friends would request of him. It was definitely money well spent at Peach Blossoms. Looking forward to their new menu! 
French,Angelina_MBS,Nice ambience,positive,40,25-Apr-17,Nice place for an afternoon gathering. The dessert was good and their hot chocolate is worth trying!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional meal,positive,50,11-Dec-16,"This restaurant is a bit hard to find but if you do, this will be one of the best experience of your life. Enjoyed a 10-course dinner. We had a table in front of the cooking plate and could observe how meticulous and professional they are. All dishes were absolutely delicious and what was striking was the quality of their products: as fresh as if it has just come out of the water. Great wine, great sake, one of the best meals ever in my life. Very expensive though."
French,Angelina_MBS,An insult to the Paris tea house,negative,10,22-May-16,"Firstly lets get this straight. Angelina Paris is fantastic. Why they would bother to ruin their name with this awfully local singapore version is a mystery. It's half asleep. No receptionist when u walk in . They get all the orders wrong and don't even understand when you ask for certain items that are on their own menu. When ordering an omelette angelina they bring a club sandwich. When you ask for no tomato in the omelette, they still put it it in ... And guess what.. They used tinned tomatoes in an omelette !!! When you ask for an order a side of potatoes Dauphin they don't know what that is. They omit to bring the side as ""must charge for it "" Waiters are all uninterested in the menu and have a problem understanding an order. The omelette here is half the size of the Paris version ... They probably weighed the eggs and conducted a mathematical profit account before serving it. The only good item on our table was the coffee which was excellent. A total Singaporean comedy ..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's always been my fave chilli crab place!,positive,40,1/2/2017,"I always go there every time I go to singapore just to eat their Chilli Crab, Mantou and bamboo clams! And yesterday, 1st Of Jan 2017 we had their set menu, everything was good except the fish, it's soso. The beehoon with clam is so goood, tastes like homecooked food. :) the price is also ok :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great taste,positive,50,28-Jul-15,"Centrally located in Singapore little India this offers some best food options. Crowded in peak hours. Reservations are recommended prior visiting. Do try the moti choor lados as deserts.
Highly recommended for a great culinary experience to satisfy your taste buds"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi,positive,50,10-Aug-18,The sashimi is fresh and juicy. We went for the 1-for-1 ala carte buffet only available through The Entertainer app. Value for money. I intend to bring my family there. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very Fresh Shashimi,positive,50,17-Oct-16,The shashimi served is very fresh. Service staff are quick and efficient. You do not have to wait too long for food to be served. Has quite an array of dishes on the menu. The Mango shebert and green tea cheesecake was fantastic. We enjoyed our meal very much and will certainly make a come back
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Muttu curry house,positive,40,29-Nov-15,This is a nice South Indian restaurant . There are so many in singapore to choose from . The sambar is tasty so clients keep coming back .
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum ,positive,40,07/29/15,"We liked the food! Prices were reasonable, service friendly. Good place to go when looking for dim sum. If you want to get a table for sure, make a reservation!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Veg. Food Restaurants in Singapore.,positive,40,2-Dec-14,"Finding good Indian Veg Food in Singapore can be a tedious job. Out of 3-4 restaurants we tried, we find this restaurant better than others. Quality wise n quantity wise if you are 3-4 persons then you can have tummy full dinner or lunch along with Pani poori or chaat within 100 SD ,above all no extra charges for home delivery if ordered from anywhere in Singapore.One can visit little India and nearby places but the strong smell of other food varieties might have confined our search for other outlets. Once finalized we relied on this and had home delivery thus saved to n fro taxi charges.Therefore one must rely on personal instincts before jumping to any exclusive conclusion."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A must for Sushi lover,positive,50,20-May-18,"One of the finest Omakase in Singapore my wife said that. Located in the ground floor, same as lobby of the Carlton Hotel, it provides both private room as well as share table over the counter where the Chef prepare each and every bite of your sushi & Sashimi. My wife ordered a small set, 15 pieces, Omakase cost $ (Singaporian) 220 cuz she's a small lady. The Chef was very kind to cutdown the size of rice in each sahimi underneath the superb and fresh various kind of fish such as Uni, Akami,O Toro, Ama-E bi, Shima-Aji, and others which we did not know the exact Japanese name. My wife told Chef that she loves white-meat-fish and he tried to give her more so. The meal was superb and worth the price. Strongly recommended if you are sushi lover. Will definitely come back !"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Great South Indian Food,positive,40,15-Nov-10,"The food at Murugan was delicious. The chatnies and sambar were really tasty. The Restaurant is very comfortable. In A city like Singapore where good food for the Indian Taste is difficult to Find Murugan was a relief.
A Must visit to everyone visiting Singapore"

Personal favourite spot!
The 'Chilli Crab' is amazing too! Everthing thing else really is actually!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dim Sum in Chinatown!,positive,50,04/29/12,Great place to get Dim Sum right in the heart of Chinatown!
French,Saveur,Food was ok. But dont expect too much from service. ,negative,30,16-Feb-17,"Food was almost tasty, except for the duck confit that was a little too salty for me. The dessert was fantastic!!Service did not do justice to the good food offered. Serving staff don't quite want to do what they should. Appetizer only came right before dessert, despite several reminders. The staff just didnt bother to follow up. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food choices keep repeating,negative,20,3-Jul-12,"I don't know if it's the management who accept the tenders from food stalls or coincidence, it appears the food and drink selection keep repeating themselves after every 5-6 stalls. There are several stalls offering similar dishes (eg, grilled seafood, fried kway teow/ noodles and even packed drinks). I stopped coming here ever sine my last visit due to the lack of food choices."
French,Paul,Bad Service,negative,10,18-May-17,"I have been to Paul three times and all those three times has been unpleasant.
Seems like the staffs are always busy and ignored customers, although there are not many customers at that moment."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice dinner ,positive,50,10/14/17,We has our dinner at peach blossom a few days back the abalone with chicken claypot is fabulous. The food was really good and the service staff sun jing mum fong Terry was very friendly will see you all soon
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Mid range Indian Food in Singapore,positive,40,8-Jun-15,"The place is very much like a restaurant in Mumbai, its crowded as their buffet is very affordable. We did not take the buffet but ordered ala-carte. Food is ok ok."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,world class Black Pepper crabs,positive,50,09/16/15,"I remember coming to this restaurant as a kid, another time a few years ago with a friend, and now by choice. Their back pepper crabs is just something that will bring you back to this restaurant every time you are in town. It is made with such an incredible recipe that i could not find anywhere else in the whole world. You will never regret coming to this place even if this was the only thing you will order.The seating areas isn't the best in town but the food is definitely is without no doubt. just try to make sure you book in advance because showing up without a booking might disappoint you as it is always a full house although they have over a crazy number of tables"

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Excellent food and service,positive,50,2-Jun-16,One of the best restaurants during my trip to Singapore. Service was excellent especially from our hostess Sara. Well done!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum!,negative,30,08/13/17,I didn't know what my girlfriend ordered but it was delicious! The best dish was the scallop pea-shoot dumpling.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",not bad,positive,40,17-Oct-13,"a good place to visit if you like to mingle with and eat like the locals. there is plenty of choice, however, be prepared to be pressured into buying from particular vendors. I guess that's why they call it a hawkers centre. you cannot walk 5 feet without being approached to eat at their food stall. a good and vibrant atmosphere and worth the visit if not just for the experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food with excellent atmosphere,positive,50,8-Dec-16,Its a good place to go to if you want a quiet evening with your other half. It comes with a complimentary drink when you first enter.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet with good variety of food,positive,40,17-Jul-17,The buffet covers a wide variety of food but some items we ordered are not so tasty. The sashimi is great so if that's what you are looking for then it is a good place to go.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good dim sum, great staff",positive,40,08/23/12,"Am sure there are better dim sum places but because my husband and I didn't have enough time to hunt for one and we were also hungry, we decided to eat at peach blossoms since we were staying in the same hotel anyway. Surprisingly, the dim sum was really good... Not a wide variety but taste was very good... We also had noodles with chicken along with a selection of dim sum, best one is the steamed pork in soy sauce with chopped red chilies! I love spicy food and this was our fave!!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best ever,positive,50,18-Oct-15,We went to Shinji for lunch and I must say it was one of the best Japanese food I ever had. The sushi is prepared individually with the freshest fish.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,You can't miss this restaurant,positive,50,07/24/12,You will find different Crystal Jade restaurant in different mall in Singapore. You will taste Chinese cuisine. They have great choice for different taste.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best black pepper crab in Singapore,positive,50,1/2/2015,"I've lived in Singapore for 2.5 years and went on a crab quest (self-assigned) to crown a champion for all preparations of crabs. After extensive (and extremely pleasurable) research, I can say with surety (after 4 visits to be sure of consistency) that the black pepper crab at Long Beach Dempsey is the best in the land.If you want a monster crab (2 kgs or larger), call ahead and reserve the crab when you reserve the table. Otherwise, the crabs will more likely be in the 1 kg range, which is still quite large. Generally, I prefer sitting inside because it can still be pretty hot outside at night.Unfortunately, the fried buns, a Singapore crab staple, are only OK, but you don't really need them with black pepper crab.Other side dishes are great too, but the star attraction is the incredible black pepper crab."
French,L_Angelus,Best French food I had in last 15 years.,positive,50,22-Feb-13,"Amazing excellent French food.
My only very good experience in a Simgapore restaurant.
Must eat are the Escargot to be followed by Veal chop. Best items on the menu."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Why not Fat Duck ?,positive,50,01/22/17,"We were wondering why it's called Fat Duck, anyway we went to try it.We tried it at their outlet in Vivo City, basement 2. It was Fri evening, we were there slightly after 6 pm, and lucky to have seats right away.We ordered a quarter roast duck, har kao, siew mai and fu pi quan, and 2 porridge for 4 of us.The duck didn't disappoint, neither did the dim sum, which is by far the best we've tasted in a very long time here in Singapore. The price of the dim sum is the usual restaurant price, so it's really good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Such good food!,positive,50,6/7/2014,"Whilst I had been warned that the service could be inconsistent but the food would be very tasty, I was disappointed on one front - the service. Both the food and the service were of the highest quality on the day we visited. Highly recommend you go early though!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too tourist focus,negative,20,10-Oct-13,"I wish the hawkers focus on the quality and taste of their products. It not exactly sheep to eat here, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired. V disappointed, especially to some brought up in Malaysia and Melbourne"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Quality Food ! value for money,positive,50,4-Apr-16,"We have visited Kailash Parbat with family numerous times - both little India and Syed Alvi Road. Excellent Place, the quality of food is very good and everytime - no exception. The Panner dishes and the Jaipur Biryani is excellent. You do not feel bloated after the food though the food is made in Ghee and rich in calories. Excellent service and good staff. Excellent chat items. Must visit."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and fast service,positive,40,17-Feb-17,Service was really fast but the food was not bad. The atmosphere was good and they were very friendly.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good place to eat chats and North indian food,positive,50,15-Mar-15,"This is a vegetarian restaurant, and this is a very good place if you want to have a taste of chats and north Indian food. Whenever I visit Singapore, I always visit this place."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ridiculously tasty. Very expensive.,positive,50,28-Oct-12,"There's not much to say about the sushi really. It's extraordinarily good, served in a small cozy room by the sushi chef. Extraordinarily good. Couldn't ask for yummier sushi. However pay attention to the price. If this were in Japan I would say it is overpriced. Since it is in Singapore perhaps it is appropriately priced. Currently they offer a low cost dinner option at SGD$220, then ""omakase"" at SGD$300 or SGD$450. Anyway the food is great just make sure you're ok with the pricing."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Indian food,positive,50,28-Oct-14,The menu has quite a bit of variety.we tried north Indian food and also chaat like bhel.sevpuri.etc. the beverages like lassi.juices etc.the food was good.and reasonably priced.the place is bang opposite mustafa mall.very hygienic.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best of the best,positive,50,15-Mar-16,"one of the best restaurants I've eaten in!
the dishes of the set menu complemented each other very well, cocktails were interesting
service very professional"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Never again!!!,negative,10,18-Oct-16,"Last night, we have made the unfortunate mistake of visiting L'entrecote. This is a place we have been couple of times and generally left satisfied since the menu is very standard and the quality of the steaks were good. Armed with our appetite for steak and fries, four of us decided to visit the place as a walk in customers. (Two other friends were on the way to join us for Cigars and coffee) The location doesn’t accept reservations and it was a Monday night so I was fairly sure the finding a table wouldn’t be a problem. When we arrived only three table were dining and place was at 10% capacity at best. We were to first to arrive and we told the host that we like to sit down and order some wine while we are waiting for our friends. We have been promptly told that we need to sit outside and wait until our full party arrives and until such time we won’t be permitted to sit down. Now, normally on a busy night, this would have been a reasonable request but on a night such as last one I considered this request to be unreasonable. After a brief argument with the host, we asked to see manager. She arrived promptly and repeated the “company policy”. Once we express our disappointment with the lack of initiative and flexibility on management site, manager simply said “I am just working here”. Well there can be a lot said about her response but suffice it to say, the owner didn’t do a good job neither empowering nor training his stuff. Just as we were deciding whether we should sit or leave and dine somewhere else the other couple arrived. At that moment the host, with a smirk on his face, told us “Now you can sit”. This was the tipping point. At that moment, I felt obligated to mention to the manager that this gentleman has no business working in service industry with such attitude and we left the place promptly and went to another restaurant. I think lack of initiative on management side, borderline rude host makes the food irrelevant and I won’t dare to expose myself and my friends to such an ordeal, so never again."
French,Paul,Paul (Westgate) - service has improved,negative,30,23-Feb-16,"It has been a long while since we last went to Paul at Westgate Mall at Jurong East, after experiencing bad service more than once. So we were pleasantly surprised when both the waitresses were actually friendly and smiley when we had dinner there last night, although service was still slow. Seems the bad reviews did work! The food was not bad, although the serving size could be slightly bigger, especially for the soup. The grilled chicken and baked sea bass were tasty. The dessert was bread pudding, which was apparently very popular but was so so only. "
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Deteriorating,negative,30,21-Oct-17,Impersonal service - even unpleasant . Quality of their specialty - idlis - not anywhere near what they used to be. They have lost a lot of loyal clients
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",I'm a Hater. But stop harassing me for overpriced food,negative,10,19-Jun-16,"This is good for tourists. It appears cheap. You can get good quality meals for $10-$15. I've been here 3 times now. I'm over it. The food is just like most other hawkers but it's more expensive for all food and drinks at this place. And the hawker people heckle you to buy. I hate being heckled or having menus shoved in my face or someone saying ""my food is good for your tummy, boss"". If you want good seafood without restaurant prices like Jumbo, then go here. If you're a tourist, this is a good first experience to hawkers. Otherwise, I would never tell someone to go here. I hate this place."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Great Duck, Lousy Service ",negative,20,10/19/15,"This review is not about the food as I have reviewed this before. Have the much applauded roast duck as well as roast meats but you certainly don't come here for the exemplary service.Firstly I have to say my expectations are minimal as this is not a fine dining restaurant, just your basic Chinese eatery. Having established this, I would have to express shock at being driven out after 40 minutes. This is something that has never happened to me. Ever.I had lunch with friends & while there was never any intention to linger, even my friends were shocked at the level of rudeness when we were asked to leave after the last dish was cleared. There was no attempt to ask if we cared for dessert. Last time I ate here, service was brusque & I did not expect much. In future if I craved the duck, it would be better to get take out rather than sit through this sort of treatment. It isn't worth it & we weren't even demanding customers. All we asked was to be able to leave when we were ready. By the way it was the tail end of lunch & there certainly wasn't a queue."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Family dinner cum birthday celebration,negative,30,17-Sep-17,"We booked this place through Chope to celebrate our second kid's birthday. Trying out for the first time. We end there at 630pm Sat (it was also the F1 weekend) It was quite crowded by the time we went there and full house by around 7 plus. Every one there went for the buffet. Order system was via the ipad/samsung tab. Our food was served after that.Servings was generally small portions to very small portions - more like for one person servings. We thought it was fine as this will help to minimize wastage.There was 5 of us, so when our initial order was served, we quickly adjusted and order more servings for each item. Overall the food and experience was just average. The staff and service was ok. For us, the most important was that the family had a good time and the birthday kid liked the meal treat. It was memorable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fast and good,negative,30,02/16/13,Upstairs in a corner in Chinatown. A mix of Chinese and tourist diners so they are doing something right. The food is good enough. Not amazing but hits the spot. Nothing in Singapore is cheap (except the trains) and this place is no exception.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,negative,30,2-Jan-13,"Std Hawer food, will not travel there as a Singaporean. There are other places with similar food, better taste and more reasonable price"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent food,positive,50,3-Jul-15,"I have visited this place many time. Very good in terms of variety, quality and consistency.
Staff is friendly and food is not very expensive."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good place for South Indian food,positive,40,19-May-17,"Though rates on little higher side, good food is served. Perfect South Indian taste. Could be better ambience and professionalism. Trusted place for sole veg food."
French,Saveur,foie gras can be better,positive,40,21-Jul-16,"1 side is slightly crisp, the other side just nice 100% cooked, no crisp at al. feels like the chef forgot abt that side. not as nice as it usually was. beef tenderloin was wonderful but the sides werent to my liking. but worth it for dinner set. the sea bass was even better i feel. the potatoes were great. however they dont give discount when i use voucher from chope when they said can, the last time i went. oh well. servers are more attentive compared to elsewhere...... "
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",GOOD SOUTH INDIAN FOOD,positive,50,13-Dec-11,"We were four and tried atleast 6 dishes. All of them were excellent and mouth watering. The presentation and flavors are excellent. The manager out there is very humble and ready to help with every minutest detail. They also pack the food , if u...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good,positive,40,8-Jul-17,"Sashimi was good, better than the grilled fare. Service was alright, ambience was nice. Packed during the weekend."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Star of the show - Steak didnt quite measure upto standard,negative,20,12-Mar-16,"Went to this outlet since the one at Ann Siang was fully booked. It was a family dinner outing and other than the lovely setting overlooking the river, everything else turned out to be a damp squib. Service quality was very very basic, steak quality definitely very poor (The Ribeye was extremely stringy and the fat content too much). We had ordered for Medium rare and it wasnt done to perfection. Overall, it felt as if we were dining at a highway restaurant in the US. Value for money was also not very good. The housepour wine at 16++S$ was terrible."
French,L_Angelus,Great quality food but lousy service,negative,30,26-Nov-14,"Had a wonderful meal at this restaurant however the service was absolutely lousy, and we were often waiting to be served.The waitress never smiled once, simply put the customer last and made no effort to build up a rapport so we did'nt feel welcomed whatsoever. It was clear that she did'nt want to be working there.I found the food to be over-priced however I'm not upto date with the prices within Singapore so be aware of that.There are certainly better restaurants on Club St with staff who actually want you in their restaurant, go elsewhere instead !"
French,Paul,Classic European afternoon tea ,positive,40,19-Oct-15,"With a wide range of places to eat and drink in the Orchard shopping district, here is an ideal (relatively less crowded) place to bring mom and sister for a nice chat. Macarons were not remarkable but coffee and ambience made up for it."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birhday lunch,positive,50,10/29/16,"My family celebrated my father's birhday at Peach Blossom. The service was great, the food was delicious! Special thanks to Terry Lim, Mun Fung and Bowie"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great place and good food,positive,40,19-Apr-14,"Excellent quality food.
Great ambience
Great staff very helpful and kind
Price is decent
I will say must for anyone looking out for indian food at little india"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A seriously misunderstood restaurant,positive,50,18-May-11,"I'm not sure what planet the previous reviewers are from, but this is a ""do not miss"" visit when in Singapore. Sure it is expensive, but if you are interested in trying the best of the best you must visit. Tetsuya Wakuda's commitment to only using the best and freshest ingredients possible (even if it means sourcing them from far away) results in an unforgettable taste experience. The light and sensitive touch in the kitchen, with a focus on not messing with quality ingredients is no doubt due to his grounding in japanese cuisine. The sea urchin with barely-cooked lobster topped by caviar is an ethereal experience that I recommend to all. The only down side is a heavily marked-up wine list with no half bottle options, but the sommelier kindly provided 3 glass pours for the price of a half bottle. The service is immaculate and friendly. If this does not get 3 Michelin stars soon, a Senate enquiry will be warranted!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great place for steak,positive,40,26-Feb-17,"If you enjoy steak and fries but hate paying absurd prices... this is a great place to visit! The steak is more minute steak with a very nice sauce, fries are all you can eat and you feel like in a tiny French restaurant... Definitely a new addition to our regular places! "
French,Paul,Just got to laugh,negative,20,7-Aug-17,Went to Pauls Paragon for coffee and cake.The cakes and sandwiches looked great!Sadly thats where the excitement ended.The service is really laughable. In the end i had to just go up to the counter as getting table service was non existent. Tea came with no milk. After going up and asking for milk waited 10 minutes and still no milk. Had to get up again and go look for it.Got told scolded by one of the staff members for moving tables. Even though another staff member helped us move tables and even reset the table for us.Sadly the experience was so bad - you just gotta laugh.At least it was memorable ...more like a visit to Faulty Towers.Nice cup if tea at least! And nice place to sit. And my french pastry was nice.Visit at your own peril. Helps to have no service expectation. Pastries were good.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Overpriced, but maybe worth the experience",negative,30,24-Jan-14,"As others have said, the food is not particularly a good value, and we seem to have gotten mild food poisoning. This in a city where it is very hard to find bad food. However, the experience of haggling for food and then sitting outside while sharing long tables with locals and visitors alike might be to your liking. We found it an interesting experience but will not return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Marketed to tourists,negative,30,5-Dec-12,Certain stalls are good but the place is a tourist attraction so prices are overall more expensive than other hawker centres.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average,negative,30,23-May-16,"Food and service was average. Good value for the steak and frites. Selection was good. Service not so good, they seemed to be rushing us along."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome food and great hospitality,positive,50,15-Sep-15,The food here is awesome. Heaven for Indians in Singapore. The place is quite clean and staff is courteous. Portions servings are enough for two. Little on the expensive side but we didnt mind it as everything compensated the high prices. The place is conveniently located on main road and is accessible easily through MRT (local singapore transport). Thumbs-up!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,negative,20,04/19/15,"This restaurant had been recommended , but unfortunately we were not impressed. The restaurant lacked atmosphere and the food, admittedly not dim sum was only average at best. We had looked forward to a meal in Chinatown, but left unimpressed. We also felt that the food was over priced."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Place for Dining Asian Food,positive,50,26-Aug-15,"We caught the train from Somerset MRT (Red Line to Jurong East), only two stops and a short walk to the food centre. There is a variety of Asian food available, please walk around and pick the food you wish to eat. We had Chilli Crab from stall 49 (Denmark), the food was very tasty and not expensive. Good value for money, a must visit place in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Razor Clam,positive,40,01/15/16,"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurant in Singapore, they serve the best crab. But my favorite is razor clam steam with garlic and the canadian live oyster. They have live alaskan crab woow"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach Seafood is consistent,positive,40,01/29/15,"I have always liked Long Beach Seafood @ Dempsey. Be forewarned, if you can get out of Long Beach for under $60 per person you have not experienced their black pepper crab or chili crab-and you definitely haven't washed it all down with a beer. I suggest going at lunch as they actually remove the entire crab from the shell. I also like to sit outside on the veranda. This is always an experience. One recommendation--bring your own napkins, towels, and/or go into the restroom and grab a stack of paper towels. These are seriously messy dishes and the restaurant will provide the equivalent of a tissue and wetnap for the end of the meal. BTW-- Long Beach is much preferred to No Signboard and several locals highly recommended Hua Yu Wee on the East Cost for crab which I did not get to."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Very tasty,positive,40,13-Jul-15,"We had 3 varieties of dosas&all were good.
Podi ,masala&ghee everything was perfect in their own way.
Sambar vada I was not upto the mark as they simply put vadais in hot sambar.
Chutneys were so good & fresh."
French,Saveur,value for money,positive,40,28-May-17,love the duck confit and the angel hair pasta. the wide variety of desserts are also consistently good. we like the salted caramel lava cake the best
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty fresh sashimi,positive,40,22-Nov-17,Sashimi is fresh and waitresses are friendly. I like the sashimi. Lacks dessert though and would have been great if 5hey offer ice cream.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place ,positive,50,11-Sep-15,"The selection of good available for the buffet is awesome, ranging from sashimi to grilled food. The sashimi here was fresh. They had no buffet counters. We had to order the food and it would be served to us, which is better as the food was prepared upon ordering."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",As authentic as it gets @ SG,positive,40,16-Jun-16,"This restaurant offers North Indian fare and is one of the few places where I have gone more than a couple of times for its Chole-Bhature. Good service, cheap prices and good spread make it a bargain. If you are craving for north Indian food in SG then you can give this place shot."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always great satay,positive,40,8-Jun-17,"The satay has always been good at Newton over the many years I have been visiting Singapore. It's the reason I visit Newton. It's still as good as always, and we also really enjoyed the fried rice. Great atmosphere and plenty of choice - a must when visiting Singapore. I've only taken off one point because it's not that cheap anymore and the touting can be a bit annoying, although that has improved greatly over the years."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent steak house,positive,50,12-Aug-13,"I have tried many steak houses in singapore but this one is definitely my favorite.The meat is delicious and so are the fries (if you like them overfried)and all of this at a reareasonable price for singaporeTheir outdoor tables have a nice atmosphere, but it's very bland inside so get an outside table."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood Place But Expensive,negative,30,4/1/2014,"Family of 5 went to try again, but, it has become more expensive this time round.We had:-1) Chilli Crab And Pepper Crab...The pepper was better Than The Chilli.2) Kai Lan Veggie...Nicely Done.3) Frog Legs - Fried With Chilli And Garlic...Portions Were Small.4) Beef Stew...Beef Was Very Tender.5) Fried Rice.On the whole, it was nice, especially the Beef Stew. The Chilli Crab was a bit of a disappointment. Service was good. Even though we had to request for drinks more than once. It saw a full house the evening we went."
French,Paul,Expensive lunch,negative,30,28-Dec-14,Great looking place with a big queue. The whole concept seems based on keeping you waiting to maintain the queue. After fifteen minutes waiting we eventually got a table. The waited ten minutes to get served. The menu was good with a wide array of breads etc. the omelette I had was good and the salad excellent. They had ran out of small macaroons and the desert seemed to be missing components. Unless you like queuing to be with the incrowd best avoid! 
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just alright...,negative,30,10/2/2015,"Waited for more than 30mins on a Friday dinner. Worth the wait? I don't think so. Can get half the price for the duck noodle at hawker, with similar or better taste. For those who like the duck snow bun, can give it a try. Sweet and crispy. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over rated steaks,negative,30,16-Nov-17,Steaks were not as tasty as we expected them to be. Over rated. Fries were addictive n good though. So was the bone marrow appetiser. The duck Rillete was a disappointment too.
French,Paul,Really 2.5 is more accurate.,negative,30,20-Jul-15,"Hmm, the food is good, the atmosphere is nice, even the ""outdoor"" seating, but the service and policies really bring it down, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.This a popular restaurant and the long queue waiting to get seated shows that, it also calls out for a better managed system, maybe a waiting list and SMS when there is an available table, something better. There is also a take away counter, like a traditional bakery with many tasty items calling out to be taken home. This take away counter presents another odd policy/system that should be better thought out. There are items at the take away counter that aren't on the menu, and you can't order them if you are dining in. This is such an odd decision, it is the same restaurant/kitchen the food is already prepared, sell the item for a dollar more and laugh all the way to the bank; yet they would not serve it. Speaking of serving items, our drinks arrived much after our food, and many follow up requests, even a freshly baked waffle came before Ice Lemon Tea. Even the second round of tea took so long to arrive, very disappointing."

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Better curry,negative,30,9-Feb-12,the prata was ok. Curry was better than most other places. worth a shot.

French,Angelina_MBS,"A place for Sweet Tooth. (Long winded review, Personal experience)",positive,40,27-Jul-15,"I been to Angelina twice.The first visit, was during their soft launch. I reached earlier than my friend and served by Joseph. He patiently introduced Angelina's signature dishes and desserts to me and I ordered his recommendation, Mushroom Risotto, Signature Hot Chocolate and Mont Blanc. I personally really love the signature Hot Chocolate and the Mont Blanc, YES, they are SWEET. I read some comments that the signature Hot Chocolate was not HOT. I would say the temperature of the hot chocolate was just nice to drink as a dessert, if too hot, I would not enjoy to continue one sip to another non-stop. (hehe...) I had requested to warm up my hot chocolate again after I finished my Mushroom Risotto. I love the signature Mont Blanc with meringue base, the ""thick"" chestnut puree wins my heart... It was so ""lovely"". The Mushroom Risotto was a bit ""too much""... Joseph saw my face after tasted the risotto, he stepped forward and asked for my comments. I told him, ""It was a moist and creamy risotto, but additional pine nuts had overtake the mushrooms' taste"". He immediately back to the kitchen and informed the chef my comments and asked me if I want to change the Mushroom Risotto to other main course on the menu without any obligations. (I was really embarrassing, I felt I am a picky customer.)Well, I would only say Angelina is too generous.That is really true when my friend ordered a Caeser Salad as she was on diet (Bad timing and she is not a sweet tooth person). When I looked at the Menu, I was bothering by its price on the menu, is at the higher side for a Ceaser Salad. But it is worthy, my friend was satisfied, the portion is enough for 2 person sharing, the ingredients is fresh and delicious. Overall : ??? 3.8Food : ???? 4.0Service : ???? 4.0 I'm aware they are young who probably less experience in F&B service industry. Give them a chance and they trying to do their best too.Atmosphere : ??? 3.5Great Location. But partially of the restaurant was high ceiling, it would be a bit warm during the hot weather especially in Singapore. Solid woods furniture, is grand but heavy. Limited space."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,positive,50,1-Aug-14,Instead of eating at the well overpriced hotel restaurants I would go to Newton Circus_ a food hawker - as they are called locally. The variety of foods amazing! The prices range from cheap to reasonable. The Hawkers in Singapore are well regulated and licensed. Sanitation and cleaniness are not a problem through frequent inspection. I liked the atmosphere as well.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Highly recommended,positive,50,21-Mar-17,"Highly recommended for a visit to Singapore. Excellent food, reasonably priced, and great atmosphere. Great experience of open air eating."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase birthday celebration,positive,40,9-Aug-18,"Celebrated my Fiance's birthday with Omakase Yume lunch sets at Carlton Hotel. It was a memorable gastronomical experience and we enjoyed every item prepared. Recommended to sit at the counter seats for omakase as it was interesting to watch how the Chef prepares each item. Ingredients were fresh and the layers of flavour were overwhelming! Every dish is a surprise. Service staffs are friendly and cheerful, and they prepared a small surprise for the birthday celebration. Total bill amount to $588 for 2 pax so I wouldn't say it is valued for money."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"too much msg in the food, cause the group was really thirsty afterwards. otherwise the pushcarts added to the whole dim...",negative,30,10/16/08,"too much msg in the food, cause the group was really thirsty afterwards. otherwise the pushcarts added to the whole dim sum experience."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",When you crave for Indian Food,positive,50,17-Jan-18,"In Singapore wheneber you crave for indian food, your destination should be Kailash Parbat.
Situated in heart of Little India, this place is heaven for food lovers."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",More than just a meal,positive,50,14-Aug-13,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I made reservations for Shinji for my wife's birthday (a vegetarian who eats fish), and was certain that I'd be able to get something suitable for myself (meat eater who does not eat fish), as I normally do when in Japanese restaurants. When we sat down, it was explained that this was a fish only restaurant, and they had no meat...well, I was bracing myself for a long night of watching others eat! Our Maitre d' (I am sad that I never got her name) explained the concept, the fixed menu, and asked us for any particular tastes / exceptions to our diet - ""I'll be able to eat tuna..."". Our sushi chef Takahiro was given the challenge of making a menu to suit me, while my wife enjoyed an amazing array of fishy concoctions (sea urchin, salmon roe, octopus, baby squid, and several sashimi and nigiri fish courses as well as several more that I can't remember!). I was given the full array of tuna, with my favourite being the fatty, belly tuna (their fish is flown in daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, and they don't open when the market isn't open).The interaction with the chefs was a real bonus which was what made this the experience that set this meal apart for me, We've eaten some excellent sushi (again, mainly my wife) in Japan, and the interaction is good, but there seemed to be more communication here (possibly a language thing), and plenty of joking around...which leads me to my final point:I brought my wife here for her birthday, and at the end of the meal, the lights went out, and the chefs came out with a little sushi cake, dressed in funny glasses and hats and sung her happy birthday! A real, unexpected surprise which really touched us!It was a fantastic meal, we left fat and happy! Yes, it was pretty extravagant, but more than worth it. We will certainly be back next time we're in Singapore!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Celebrate Dad's 82nd birthday ,positive,50,6/10/2017,"Great food and service. Special thanks for the manager, Terry for writing the beautiful and thoughtful Chinese birthday greeting, and hand made the God of Longevity. Not forgetting Christine and Bowie for the excellent service with a wonderful smile all the time! Thanks for making this birthday celebration a very memorable one! "
French,Paul,Arrogant and Rude Service,negative,10,6-Aug-16,"Was at the Paul's outlet in Marina Bay ( I did not want to even add the place to Trip Advisor). Service crew there was really not interested to do business. Food was so so and the soup really too sweet. There were no baby chairs and it seemed as though they did not know what they were doing. When the kid with us was babbling , they gave dirty looks and shook their heads especially the manageress. Was disgusted with this level of service so we we paid and left without finishing the food - just lost our appetite. I give this the worse rating I've ever given to a food outlet ( never thought it would be a Paul's outlet though) - ZERO thumbs out of Five.... AVOID EATING HERE !!Honestly if you don't have the crew business, please stop expanding cos you just lost credibility with me and my friends. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great for biz and first date to impress.,positive,50,28-May-13,"My 2nd time here. The service is top notch. The service staff are ever attentive. The quality of food is at its finest and freshest. Brought my partner for a date and order a bottle of champagne, bill came up to SGD$1224, 10 course meal. Book in advance and u are expected to leave ur credit card details to them via a fax or email. With the understanding if u fail to cancel the reservation 1-2 days advance, $400++ per head will be deducted off ur card."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very expensive, but you got back what you paid",positive,40,1-Mar-16,"A friend who has been to this venue many times suggested us to try it. It is a somewhat fusion Japanese venue, or they are serving a mix of Japanese foods plus some western dishes.I think they only serve a fixed menu of the day during dinner hours. We had many present surprises with the foods that they served, starting from the very first course. For the entire dinner, there were only 2 or 3 courses that were less impressive; nevertheless, still tasted ok. One of the most unexpected surprises was the noodle in a cold soup with lime juice taste; it was such a refreshing dish after the heavy meal (before the deserts).The only drawback that I could think of was its price tag, approx. S$700+ per head. Nevertheless, you are getting back what you paid through the services that they provided and the foods that they served. Should give it a try when you are in town, and of course when you can afford to indulge yourself with a fancy dinner."
French,Paul,Busy place and yummy tart,negative,30,1-Sep-18,This restaurant is very understaffed. Should only go if you are not in a rush. The blueberry tart is yummy .
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L'Entrecote Suntec City - Not so French afterall,negative,30,20-Dec-14,"Have randomly chosen this restaurant as lunchtime crowd in Suntec was really busy then on a Saturday. This was one of the only few restaurants that did not look busy probably due to price since French food?? We were initially attracted by their lunch set meal - burger set. In the end, we ordered escargot as starters, main course : seabass and duck confit with rice. We like the seabass and their famous butter sauce the best. The duck confit was alright except can see visible fats from the thigh which can be a turn off. Escargot was bland. They were not generous with bread though. The coffee was terrible as a glass of wine is expensive. The restaurant is a fusion of French/American with loud music playing in the air. I can see mostly expats with mix of Asians and children are allowed in the restaurants probably due to the casual setting. The service staff looked busy and stress. The table like French setting but the whole room/atmosphere looks very casual. Dark with spotlights all over. The restaurant has potential but I think they can improve on their concept better."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to try pepper or chili crab,positive,40,10/4/2016,"As one of the most famous and expensive (relatively speaking) restaurants that serve pepper or chili crab, Long Beach has a big reputation to live up to...and it did deliver. We tried both the chili and black pepper crab which were both excellent. Would also highly recommend the fried prawns prepared using their 'house special' style as well as the seafood fried rice. While we didn't try the set menu options they seemed to offer decent value given the range of dishes it allows to sample. Restaurant offers also a range of other seafood dishes. Given its reputation the place was packed and reservations are required. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Revamped and better now...,negative,30,9-Feb-12,"Years ago I would give only 1 star to this Food Centre. It does not get by with good food. Prices are not exactly cheap too. But it is a one-stop to taste the local delicacies without having to travel to too many places. Having itself near Orchard Road, I suppose the little price increment is a premium the tourists have to pay. For me, I'd only go in the middle of the night if I am in the vicinity and too lazy to think of where to get a bite."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Well, not much, very touristy ",negative,20,26-Jan-18,"Honestly, average quality food here. Or I should say in general Singapore local dishes is not that good. If you been to northern Malaysia, that will be a real deal.Expensive, tasteless, dont have any distinctive characteris in the food. Well, if you dont mind the above, please visit then. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really good Japanese buffet,positive,50,14-Apr-17,"Tucked away inside UE Mall, you could miss this place if you didn't know about it. You have to reserve a table as the place gets really busy. For around S$47 you get a buffet choice of over 100 items! This is incredible value and you can order as much as you can. Desserts are charged separately. The food items are made to order, so you don't pick from a stale buffet table. You order on their tablet and very swiftly the food will start to arrive. We're not fans of cold tofu, so that item was a miss for us. But everything else was really good. I was actually really surprised at the price because this is a quality restaurant in a nice location, service is impeccable and the food delicious. A must try for any fans of Japanese food. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good for couple alone time on non-peak hours,positive,40,14-May-17,"Everything was wonderful except for the sittings. The tables were too packed closely to each other, didn't have enough privacy for talking."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lip smacking stuff,positive,50,03/22/17,"Fatty Char siew. Roast duck. Charcoal buns with peppery duck fillings. I am just going to recommend dishes to try because the food served at this restaurant is nothing short of amazing, my words would not do it sufficient justice. Your taste buds would thank me for it, I kid you not!"
French,Poulet,Nothing Special,negative,20,13-Jan-14,THe name suggests that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing special or distinct about this place except for the name..... would not revisit again..... too many good options abound in this lovely city of ours to waste time and money on this.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker food at its best ,positive,50,7-Jun-15,"A few reviews we saw about this place suggested the food vendors were pushy. We didn't experience any of that. We were able to sit & determine what we wanted which consisted of mutabar, satay and beer (well it was Friday night) and we orders & received all in good time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thoroughly pleasant & filling experience. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Reheated but still cold ......,negative,10,18-Jan-17,"We use to be great fans of this and another Muthu's branch at Suntec. It is reheated not cooked freshly and the whole meal, apart from the naans tasted tired. Essentially is is Teka Centre quality at four or five times the price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Late night supper & drinks,negative,30,28-Jul-16,"You may find this place cheap and value for money while gathering with friends. I usually have beers with friends after work here. However, for seafood lover, remember to ensure the prices before you ordering. Some seafood stalls will charge foreigner higher prices. They open till late night so it's a great place after late work. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori,positive,50,6-Sep-16,"Worth the money with the range of items on the buffet menu. Sashmi was fresh and succulent.

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best value steak in town,positive,50,18-Dec-15,"There are cheaper steaks, and there are better steaks for a lot more money. But in terms of best value for money for a mouthwatering steak, you can't go past Les Bouchons. With free flow fries, dinner rolls and a side salad, you don't need to even order an appetiser. Best choice, go with the extra-tender Beef Filet with the Blue Cheese sauce."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must eat here!,positive,40,12-Sep-13,"Visited Singapore 4 times in the last 4 years and every single time have stopped for a meal at Newton circus. Nearly all the hawkers sell the same food, however i go towards the ones that sell more seafood. Fried rice, Prawns , even the veggies are fabulous. Open till quite late , fun to sit outside with the place being always crowded. Decently priced as well. Must eat here atleast once when you visit singapore"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,positive,40,27-Jun-17,"The food was excellent. With the self ordering system, it was much easier to manage the ordering and the food was served fast. The dessert and drink were not included in the buffet."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Decent steak, but service could be faster",negative,30,4-Oct-15,"This was our second visit to the restaurant, and I must say that the first one was better. The service was good up to the point that we were seated, then we felt forgotten about. The French manager is wonderful, but the staff not so much. For some reason, we had fruit flies buzzing around our table. The first time we told a server, he just waled away looking confused. The French manager later brought a bottle of Febreeze (wonder how thats going to counter the flies), sprayed that around the table and left, apologising profusely. In the end, we got a table outside.The food takes a very long time to arrive. It's good for a lengthy meal, but if you want to have dinner in an hour and be out of there, this is not the place to be.The steaks are very value for money, and the wine selection is good for the price you pay, but the quality of the steaks isn't really the best. But what more could you expect for $40?We had the bone marrow to start with, and while it was buttery and delicious, it was a tad under seasoned. It needed a squeeze of lemon to cut through it's richness.Desserts were good, and one friend commented that he would come back just for dessert, not for the mains.Would we go back? Yes. Because you won't find more value for money steaks anywhere short of making them yourself. The restaurant looks more expensive than it is, which is always a plus in my book. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another great Hawkers food market in Singapore. ,positive,50,9-Oct-16,"This hawkers market has recently been given a make over. Lovely clean tables and seats with plent of room for all. So many choices that it gets hard to decide what and where to eat. The food is fresh, flavorful and cheap. Order you meals from the hawkers and they deliver your selections to your table and then you pay them. Cash only trade here. Watch out for the man selling tissues, as the hawkers don't have napkins. A must to visit in Singapore."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,london fat duck the duck is fat but Tim sum dishes is good.,negative,30,06/16/15,"when to try the London fat duck after the review. the 1st time we are lucky when in on a Saturday morning after 10 am not crowded no queue.you have to queue because the place is small sitting limited not that is so good that you queue.order their famous/popular dishes the duck taste good though is fat, the char siew is nice but expensive ($14.80 for about 10-12 small slice)had the wanton noodle not bad like hong kong noodle. price $6.80 per bowl.had some take away the snow bun, duck and char siew and duck dumpling. the duck dumpling is very ordinary nothing to shout about is like normal hong kong dumpling.with bean.($12.90)a week later went with some friend to try the food. This time I order the tim sum. the spring roll, chee cheong fun with do fritter & prawn, pan fried carrot cake, siew mai, they are good. Also order the fat duck and snow bun and char siew . but this time round the fat duck is really fat and oily don't think will order again.the service and knowledge from the staff of the little restaurant is poor in serving their customer.not well train if you don't mind the attitude and their reply concentrate on the food is not bad but is differently not worth to queue for long hours.order custard bun they said no stock. how to be no stock when your restaurant just open for business either the chef don't make the bun or..... don't expect any service just make do and try the food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Same ol' food, twice the price",negative,20,17-Jan-13,Newton hawker centre and Boat Quay must have shared the same founder. Head down to East Coast hawker for a better deal and better view.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great atmosphere,positive,40,26-Jan-15,"Great location just by the river, had steak with fries (free flow but did not ask for seconds as it is a lot.). Was served bread as a starter accompanied by salad. Salad was good however the bread is disappointing as it is cold and hard, making it hard to chew. The steak however was amazing. Kudos to the steak. Service is prompt and attentive. Overall was a great experience despite the rock-hard bread."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Vegetarian Food....and air conditioning.,negative,30,27-Nov-15,"We chose this place as it looked like they would have air-conditioning and offer some respite form the Singapore heat-and it did.We arrived late lunch and despite the sparse crowd, the wait staff were in no hurry to serve. The food however was delicious and well worth it. Pricier than the surrounding restaurants in Little India but worth it for the quality of food and the air-conditioning"

French,Angelina_MBS,Excellent Service,positive,50,9-Feb-17,"Excellent service (consider we have a toddler with us). The food was great. Compare to Paris's Angelina, The hot chocolate is a little bit more creamy but still, we had a great experience in Angelina Singapore"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but be careful!!,positive,40,27-Oct-13,"Silly little me got a bit carried away and forgot to ask for the total before ordering our food. The bill was double what we should have been paying so please be careful as the stall owners are trying to pull a fast one on tourists. But in saying this we took our time and picked the food we wanted to eat, it was delicious, well cooked and full of flavour. We had Black Pepper King Prawns and Chilli Sqiud plus a couple of mammoth Tiger beers. I still enjoyed the experience even tho we were swindled for a few extra dollars. Fair play! Haha"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grill Sting Ray,positive,40,3-Apr-17,"Fantastic and delicious Grill Sting Ray and Black Pepper Beef.
There are many other seafood.. Also, try to Vegetarian Rojak as it taste quite different from the black sauce."

A couple of us who are not so partial to the white saggy testicle like sacks will be disappointed as there was not much else on offer!

good snacks and tot bits, good biryani.
overall good Indian vegetarian food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Would have got ten out of ten, but staff were glum",positive,40,10/30/12,"Terrific classic yum cha food. It was full of flavour, generous servings of prawns, yummy slippery and crispy coatings on tasty fillings. Servings were attractive.It was inexpensive, quick and has a very pleasant ambience, apart from the somewhat glum waitrons.Sited in an old shop house, up a flight of lovely teak stairs, it is in the middle of the bustling and crazy night market. Certainly the place to visit in Chinatown. Loved the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper crab,negative,30,12/14/17,"We were told by locals to go and try black pepper crab at this restaurant. We did. The service was good. They even took out the meat from the crab for you. However the most important thing about food is the ingredients. The crab is not great at all. They give you mud crabs which are tasteless. Therefore black pepper, which you can order for hotter or less hot, is the only taste you get from this dish. And the razor cram was overcooked. So all in all the lunch was not so good as expected and it was expensive too. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not impressed with food. Poor service.,negative,20,13-Oct-17,"Utilised the birthday voucher, and tried it out for the first time. Not impressed with food but worse is the service. The sushi rice vinegar was too overloaded. The yakitori items were overcooked. Finally the service was very the ????Its ok because we will not be patronising again even if there is free dining for both. In addition, first time using Chope Reservation and the number 68714254 kept calling me to confirm despite me having confirmed after reservation, then 15 mins before reservation and then after being in restaurant for 30 mins already. It auto called me back when I ended the call and in the end, I had to block the number. Will steer clear of Chope Reservation in the future."

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",not blown away,negative,30,16-Jan-16,"we were really looking forward to eating here. A good friend who traveled to Singapore raved about this restaurant. The food IS not all that much better than what's in New York, or any medium size city in the US. The rata is good, but...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of restaurants,positive,40,12-Sep-12,"If you want to feel the vibe of being in Singapore, this is a nice place to visit especially for the first timers. Just choose a restaurant and sit down nearby, and the staff will come to you with a menu and all. You pay to the staff directly after every order."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sadly Disappointed,negative,30,24-Jul-15,"I went to this restaurant with such high hopes (50 Best in the World, Friends highly recommended, etc etc…), I was summarily disappointed however. The food, yes, was quite tasty, was it worth what we were charged for it, however, no. We are more than willing to dole of money on a special dinner, this just wasn't all that special. It all just felt forced and a bit rushed (my brother characterized it as Benihana's Logical Maximum). We enjoyed the use of the Teppan grill and our chef was friendly. As a whole it just wasn't on par with its peer competitors we have dined at around the globe, especially given the exorbitant price."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Super awesome idli !!! That's All about it !!,positive,50,21-Jul-14,"No one can beat their soft idlis and tangy sauces with it... Superb superb and just superb... If you haven't had this, u hav had nothing in little india, singapore..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worst Experience Ever,negative,10,12/9/2012," My husband and I love to eat out regularly and we know when the food is superb, good or simply bad. Upon our arrival, with reservations, we were given a huge table for six and seated next to the glass wall which we could physically see our neighbors eating and vice versa. The lady who took care of our table did not know english so it was quite frustrating to get around with the different items on the menu. We finally settled for simpler items, prawns and fish. The prawns came in first very nicely presented and large but the taste was terrible. It seemed it was boiled in sea water and rather raw. The sauce that accompanied it was not too bad to relieve the after taste of the sea water. When the fish came in, we had requested a fried red snapper, it looked like a small fried coy!! This was even worse. My husband just had a few bites of this and had to leave it as it was full of tiny bones. To drink, my husband had a coke and I had a glass of wine. You can't go wrong here but to pay the price for a bad glass of wine surely hurts. The cost in wine was 19.00 for a glass!! The cost of the overall dinner was $128.65!! A big ripoff for what we got. We are used to pay on occasions $400 for two with no regrets if the food was exceptionally good. So the price for dinner is not an issue for us. There are no napkins on the tables to be seem. They only give you wipes and no utensils. You basically eat with your hands if you do not know how to eat with chop sticks and if you run out of wipes and ask for more, you are charged for it!! For sure we will not return. The prices for the food and ambience is not worth it. The only good thing to remember was that they were able to call a taxi for us and this came very fast. We did not have to wait to leave!! Thank God and good riddence. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent ,positive,50,10-Mar-18,"So we came here for my brothers birthday and it was fantastic.

Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Fat duck, inconsistent service ",negative,30,12/17/16,"We wanted a light lunch , hence ordered noodles with duck drum stick (extra $3), fish porridge and a bowl of wanton. Found the quality and taste of food average at most, but the duck drum was quite fatty in my opinion. However, some of the staff seemed to lack experience and worked at a snail's pace. They could improve on their professionalism and work pace. Prices are reasonable for it's Orchard location."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Normal Dimsum,negative,30,06/23/16,"i'm a big fan of Dimsum, but the portion here is small and expensive.

Foods were luxury & tasty, like works of art ! Very enjoyable ! I must say it is not the type of restaurant that you go often as the set menu is about $500 per head.

French,Angelina_MBS,"The case of a hot chocolate went wrong, tasted horrible and was different to the one in Paris.",negative,20,22-Jul-17,"I had the chance to try the original Angelina in Paris, and their hot chocolate is the best I have ever drank. However, the one in Singapore tasted different, and I mean it in a bad way.Angelina's hot chocolate is unique because theirs is known to be super thick and filling. I enjoyed the one in Paris because the rich taste of the chocolate was able to penetrate the thickness, which resulted in a complex but an enjoyable drink. But the one in Singapore is just a poor imitation of this speciality. Yes, it was still thick, but the layered taste of chocolate was not there. It was just a plain thick and bitter. As one reviewer has said, it was a torture to finish it. So, it did not only taste different, but horrible as well.What truly disappoints me that the taste should not have been like this. I almost felt cheated. Ideally, the drink should taste the same, no matter who makes it or where it is made. If Angelina in Singapore cannot recreate the same drink, they might as well change its name in their menu.On the other note, the service is great. Their Mont-Blanc tea is nice, has a flowery, calming smell and pleasant taste. But seriously, that hot chocolate is just plain unforgivable."

While ok, it was a disappointment this time, with a vastly reduced Yum Cha menu, most of the common favourites are gone, not to be found... Sad! The place has become a little tired.

French,Saveur,Nice food,positive,40,9-Aug-16,Food was great but portion could have been slightly more. They charged for water but was not prompted in refilling it. My Friend and I were not full after the meal.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice ambience & hospitality with great food,positive,40,7-Oct-14,"We happened to be in this chain's outlet in Syed Alwi Road this weekend, which was not planned for, but just stepped in. The staff were prompt to attend to us as well as offered us better seating as soon as there was one vacant, as the restaurant was quite packed. The food tasted great, we tried new combinations like Diwani Handi, Hariyali Naan. It's priced a bit on the higher side; maybe they also need to improve on acoustics of the seating area as it seems to be noisy if people around start to talk a lot..overall we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, above all the prompt fast service in spite of the flow of guests"

Had the wonderful Chili Crab, with amazing vegetables and crab rice. Delicious!However, the service was so bad, that it nearly ruined our experience. What's up with no napkins???? Everyone gets a wet wipe, and that's it, you are on your own. The problem is that you eat everything with your hands, and all foods are sauce based, so you do the math.I looked over at other tables in the crowded restaurant, and everyone was licking their fingers trying to cope with the absence of the civilized napkin. Weird."
French,Saveur,Affordable casual french food!,positive,40,26-Feb-17,Affordable casual french food around town. My friends always order the duck confit (tender and flavourful) while I always order the Saveur pasta. It's meant to be an appetiser but I will order two portions as a Main

I also want to pay particular homage to Lynn our waitress, she made our night, so special, we will never forget you Lynn! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old Yum Cha charm,positive,40,4/7/2012,"We took the High Tea Buffet Promotion - $21.80++ for adults and $16.80++ for children 3pm-6pm (Last order at 5.30pm).Even thou it's a weekday we got a shock when we enter as there's a huge crowd; we manage to get a table along the restaurant pathway (which is a good choice). :)We were presented with a menu (which is a A4 size red colour paper), a total of 67 items were listed. There's 5 categories: Steam Dim Sum, Fried Dim Sum ,Rice,Rice Roll & Congee, Side Dishes & Dessert.The waitress will be pushing a cart around with all the Steam/Fried Dim Sum & Side Dishes, just tell her what u want or u could simply point at the dishes (if u not sure what's the dish name, like us) and it will be put onto yr table. Or u could order from the menu, dish name is in English & Chinese.We were so overwhelm be the variety of Dim Sum available that we just keep pointing and ended up with a table cover full of food! The Dim Sum were pipping hot & fresh, personally I like the steam stuff better as I found the fried Dim Sum a tad too oily.I would advise to get yr hand on the baked mini egg tarts & coconut tarts half way though yr meal and not wait till last as they run out pretty fast, it's really delicious.A good way to end the meal with the lemongrass jelly with fruits, the slight tangy favor of lemongrass is refreshing after a full meal.It's a nice place to have a meal and play catch-up with friend or family member. Just don't seat too far away from the pathway, cos at times it's had to catch the attention of the waitress & the push cart may not be able to go near yr table."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Busy with great variety,positive,50,16-Jan-16,"Visited with friends. This food is mildly cheaper than the food courts in the shopping centres but the atmosphere was much better.Look at the vendors shop fronts. If it says ""self service"" it means you have to take your food to the table, if not, they will deliver the food to you (so take note of your table number). We had the Char Siu, steamed veges, butter chicken Paneer, naan & satay. All very nice. Adequate portions."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect Indian Veg food joint ,negative,30,2-May-18,It’s known for its chaat. It’s fun to be here. Just that the staff is not that efficient.

Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Not really a tandoor.,negative,20,10-Mar-14,Went there expecting tandoor food but the buffet was just routine fare with not a single tandoor dish. Disappointed. Dull atmosphere in a lively location.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab delight! ,positive,40,10/7/2015,I had the chili crab and it's as good as my taste buds expected . They say it's more known for black pepper crab but didn't have a chance to try it . The mango sago was just ok but bonus points on presentation . The crispy kangkong with cuttlefish was average ... I wish I had the baby kailan instead . I'll rate the resto 3.5 stars but rounded up since I put more weight on the delicious crab over the other average dishes and average service. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak and chips,positive,40,16-Nov-14,"We ate here on our second night in Singapore prior to flying out to Lombok the next day. Having spent a long day walking several miles with a few liquid refreshment stops, we were in need of a hearty meal and opted for Les Bouchons in Robertson Quay. The steak was very good with plenty of chips and a pleasant half carafe of red wine. Unsurprisingly it was quite expensive but par for the course in Singapore considering the location."

We got one of the 10 course dinners,more at least it seemed like ten courses. We had both the chili and pepper crab. Both were excellent. The other food was also quite good. The pudding dessert had a great presentAtion due to the dry ice. All of us were extremely satisfied. "

Sure it was not the real deal but the food and ambience was a treat. Wait staff were superb, very attentive, service was fast despite the restaurant being full.

French,Paul,could be so good but staff are poor,negative,20,24-May-14,"Having been to Paul in the UK and France i was expecting more from the Paul in Singapore. The food is as you would expect, French and expensive but more boring than in Europe. The selections are often lacking in imagination but the contents are mostly delicious especially the desserts.The refusal to service the full menu before 11.30 is just annoying and the staff are not at all accommodating or service orientated. The breakfast menu is sparse and they refused to serve separate bread to my partner even though being vegetarian she had limited options and despite their being bread served with other non-vegetarian foods.Not impressed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good north indian food,positive,40,10-Jan-15,"Kailash Parbat is a very popular restaurant and people may have to wait to get seated. However, the wait is worth it since the food is authentic north indian food. Good main courses and desserts."
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing,negative,30,5-May-13,"My expectations were high based on previous reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed.Firstly I didn't find the staff particularly welcoming. We were the first to arrive for dinner at 19:30, it was hard to get a smile. Secondly, the staff were discrete but slow and we had to ask to place our order and it felt like an eternity before our plates were removed.The menu is quite extensive but they didn't have what I wanted, crayfish. I settles for a grilled fish, which turned out to be nothing special and expensive at over 50$. My girlfriend had a bavette which she found extremely oily and hardly touched.The restaurant itself is pleasant and offers a quality environment. My experience was disappointing to say the least. I won't go back. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dinner ,positive,50,11/19/17,"First time bring my mum for dinner,She was impressed with the ambience,the food was scrumptious and the services she received from Terry,Bowie and Jeff. They kept changing new and clean plates and refill tea without even asking.They were observant to our needs.Terry recommended new dishes like steam fish. My wife loved to eat chillies and they serve a lot of chillies.My wife finished all the chillies. Food,services,ambience,and great company made our day."
French,Paul,Ridiculous seating,negative,10,23-Dec-16,"Went to the outlet at MBFC link mall for lunch where they served reasonably priced lunch sets. My colleague and I were showed to a tiny round table fitted into a right corner of the wall with hardly any leg room for both of us. I am super furious and gave the staff a stern short lecture that I felt embarrassed for PAUL for even thinking of putting a table there for customers. These days seriously, it is clearly revenue over service even for old renowned retail establishments like PAUL. Will never visit again till they clean up their act. A great pity and a big black stain on PAUL's reputation. Hope their parent company revoke this franchise rights!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but decent enough",positive,40,10/17/15,"Preference for dim sum in Singapore is Red Star, but we couldn't get a booking, so opted for this place insteadWe also had my relatives in from Hong Kong and so finding a decent dim sum was essentialThe restaurant itself is nothing to write home about, but nevertheless, still very popular - especially with passing tourists wandering through ChinatownWe were a table of 11 and so lots of dishes were being ordered and when the aunties with their dim sum trollies caught on that it was a table of Hong Kongers, they scrambled to show off their dishes, hoping they diners would be impressedThe char siu buns went down well, but my relatives found the portions to be extremely small for the priceHowever, we all left satisfied enough"

His service is so good, recommending us food, and also the effort he puts in the flour figurine is impressive. his hard work is commendable. If there is any celebrations/ events/ or the need to host a dinner for clients, just give Terry a call & he will settle everything smoothly for us, he never fails to impress me. "

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fabulous Meal,positive,50,20-Mar-14,"We went along on a Saturday night when staying in Singapore for the weekend.What a wonderful experience. We've been to Tetsuya's years ago and loved it. This is certainly different.You are seated in a small room at a tepanyaki bar and you have dinner with 4 others. We were forewarned about this possibility. We had a lovely couple next to us who were also celebrating a birthday. The couple on the end seemed nice enough but were a little loud and intrusive, but generally were fine.We did the set menu with the wine pairing. Staff were attentive and asked about allegies and dislikes ahead of time. FOODFabulous! It was beautifully prepared and presented. They rely on the freshness and quality of their ingredients to make the dish. And what quality they are.I actually enjoyed Abalone for the first time. We both enjoyed every dish served.WINEThe wine pairing was very good and complimented the foods brilliantly. I'm not a sake drinker so they substituted any sake pairing with a wine.STAFFFriendly, attentive and professional. Sometimes almost too efficient with the taking plates away and putting new things in front of you but it's a minor thing.DECORLiked it. It's dark but not cold. The smaller room idea is a good one. PRICEIt is expensive. It was somewhere we went as a treat. It is not somewhere you plan to go for the sake of it. Saying that though, we thought it was worth it and would do it again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb!,positive,50,12-Feb-17,"Let's be honest - Waku Ghin is an expensive restaurant! But if you can afford it, I would recommend to go. It has a set menu and you can pay extra to get dishes with truffles. You will sit in a chef table and food will be made and prepared in front of your eyes. Which I always love to see as it's such a fine art in my opinion. We didn't order any wine there as we wanted to try some good sake, as its a fine Japanese restaurant. The sommelier recommended one sake and we loved it - one of the best we've ever tried!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi I have had,positive,50,28-Sep-12,"Obscenely expensive, but obscenely good. I went with my wife there yesterday. The counter setting is very intimate and customer friendly - the chef makes the sushi right in front of you, including grating the wasabi root! The fish was obviously fresh and of the highest quality. My favorite was the sea urchin (we were served two different varieties from two islands) which I had never tasted before. Visit this place at least once in your lifetime."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch,negative,10,3/1/2015,"We had lunch at Yum Cha today and every waitress treated us so rudely!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value and excellent quality ,positive,50,17-Sep-17,"Cosy restaurant parked in a not so crowded UE shopping mall.... good thing.Restaurant usually packed so reservations recommended. Have private rooms and floor seating sections too. Would be better if there were more space to cater for many more patrons.The buffet alacarte menu is commendable. The spread is wide and quality of the food served is excellent. Sections of sashimi, sushi, tempura, maki, rolls, barbecue, salad, noodles, rice, and much more.Good and fast service and orders are placed thru electronic apps (tablets). Sushi and barbecue orders takes a bit longer though as it's made fresh.The buffet price excludes dessert and drinks, though.... and kids below 5 yrs old eat for free & child rates up to 10 yrs old.Highly recommended and happy eating."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a let down,negative,20,8-Jan-17,This place is way more expensive then the maxwell road hawker centre but it does have alot of seafood dishes. We went on a Sunday for lunch and only about 1/4 of the places were open. Head to maxwell toad hawker centre for better food and cheaper prices. 
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food. Just a little noisy,positive,50,12/26/16,I've been here many times since I was a kid. And it has never changed. The Cantonese food here is decent for its price. But beware it's very noisy as people talk on top of one another. It's actually a very normal thing here. Also there are lots of kids that cry from time to time. So if you don't mind it all. Give this place a go!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible,negative,10,9-Sep-13,"Horrible food as I would like to say. The meat on the steak was very hard to chew on and it was quiet hard to swallow as well. I have been to l'entrecote in paris and it was very different from what i expected to have in singapore. I was very disappointed as the steak was too overcooked and the meat that was supposed to be juicy has lost all the juiciness. There was also lack of sauce that accompanied the hard meat steak and when i asked for more sauce,they would like to charge SGD5 just for the sauce. I wouldn't recommend to dine there although i saw many more of the menus. The main attraction of the course as in the paris is the steak and fries with the special sauce but nothing was special as it was in singapore. Very disappointed"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic selection of Asian cuisine,positive,40,21-Aug-15,"With a variety of Asian food on offer it's very hard not to find something not to like. It's a great experience too. It was my Thai girlfriend's first trip out of Thailand, even though she enjoyed the Char Siew pork rice and satay her day was made when we discovered a Thai food stall. All in all a good meal had and thoroughly recommended for first time visitors to Singapore."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety ,positive,40,5-Dec-17,"As this is a hawker center, we ordered different kinds of food to try and share amongst ourselves.We had satay, grilled chicken wings, fishball noodles and reddish cake. The food was delicious and nice to be shared. We washed down our food with Tiger beer, which made our experience very enjoyable.Do sit in the open air section in the middle, as it gets quite stuffy under the shelter."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Japanese Buffet,positive,40,4-Oct-16,"Food - The sashimi was very good. However, dishes with sauce are a bit too salty for our taste.Value - All in about $90 for two without drinks. Would consider it value for money given the quality of food and ambience.Service - We struggled with the ordering system for a while. Requested for a change of table after several attempts by the staffs to fix the tablet.Atmosphere - Typical japanese restaurant. Not too noise for a good chat."
French,Angelina_MBS,as good as in Paris?,positive,50,26-Oct-16,The hot chocolate is a must try - it is as good as the one you would taste in Paris.The service - better than in Paris.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worth a try,negative,30,6/11/2012,"The dimsum variation quite alot, and it taste great!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Terrific local food, but watch the prices",positive,40,25-Aug-13,"Loads of local food here, but many repeats among the vendors. Find a place and go back. Vendors will remember you and give you great service next time. Be careful about the seafood prices. Veggies and chicken are inexpensive here, but many of the seafood items can be quite pricey. You may enjoy a few jumbo tiger prawns then find out that plate cost $50. Discuss with the vendor beforehand so you aren't surprised.We particularly enjoyed sugar cane juice with lime or lemon from the juice stands, to go with our food. Great place!"

French,Paul,Staff more concern with her personal agenda,negative,20,20-Jun-14,"Visited the outlet at Takashimaya on the 18th June 2014 together with my wife and I, we were attended to a somewhat distracted hostess, no smile, not a care in the world. I politely told her that we would prefer to sit outside as I felt we were slightly under-dressed for the inside of the restaurant.The hostess, with funky hair highlights of her fringe walked to the end of the restaurant, placed the menu on the table and just left. Ok, maybe because we look like a couple of 'can't afford kinda people'. Realistically, I don't care about that. What really irks me was the fact that that hostess was moaning to I guess would be her supervisor about how she was not granted her leave of absence to go for her holiday.All my wife and I wanted was a peaceful meal and we can't help but to merely eat and 'watch' our comic relief. My advise to the supervisor and the moaning hostess, please take your personal issues away from your PAYING customers, you are an international restaurant, not a void deck coffeeshop. On a side note, the tomato soup was good. We basically ate our dinner, paid and got out of there. This was my very first time to Paul @ Taka, probably also my last."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very yummy!,positive,50,11/13/12,"I am a local and this is my 2nd visit. The pushcart dim sum is fantastic and I actually prefer this style to ordering, as u can see the exact dish and decide whether you want it.The food is great and inexpensive.I'm surprised that other reviewers commented about the bad service? They are mostly Chinese aunties who were quick and efficient in handing dishes to us. Maybe they don't smile too much and describe the dishes in detail, but that's because they can't speak much English and I don't fault them at all. :) Don't expect 5 star hotel service because that's not what this place is about. It's fantastic for its food, efficiency and atmosphere. "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simply wonderful ,positive,50,19-May-18,"I visited with my family for a birthday dinner after a friend recommended. I am soooo glad we took her advice!Firstly, the service was awesome. We arrived quite late on a Sunday night, about an hour before closing, but there was absolutely no sense of being rushed by the team. The waiting service was super charming, and attentive without being “in your face”. But the steak and fires....oh my days! We chose the standard size for 35 bucks (with free flow fries). Steak was cooked to perfection just how each of us liked it. When it was served, I thought the portion was perhaps a little small...but after I’d eaten most of the steak, along pops the waiter with the other half of the steak that they had kept perfectly warm!! Such a nice surprise for a hungry boy like me :) And the fries kept coming as promised.The side salad and bread were fresh and delicious too. And the small Carafe of Bordeaux was an absolute dream!I honestly can’t fault this place. In fact we are going back for our last dinner in Singapore tonight!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was not bad,positive,40,10-Mar-17,Quite a quiet place and food variety and taste was not bad. Had Donavan who is a magician to entertain us during dinner which was quite amazing to see him perform his magic
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Delicious food, nonsense service",negative,30,07/28/16,"This family favorite place would've gotten 4 stars from me if their service wasn't atrocious. We like coming for the weekday high tea buffet once in awhile because their dim sums are above average and their price is super value for money. We went again yesterday, the 7 of us. It was pretty crowded and though there were many many staff, all of them managed to not see any patrons in the restaurant. And when I did get the attention of one (for maybe some sauce or tea), they would push responsibilities back and fourth to each other until it didn't come, or we get our item after we finished our dumplings. We were rudely told to wait quite a number of times, and a paper literally shoved in my face telling me to ""circle what I wanted"" cuz she couldnt be bothered to listen to and remember my order. We were also told to wait and get things from the push carts even though we ordered after we didn't see the items we wanted on the pushcart. So we waited and nothing came out. There are a TON of things on the menu that you must order because they don't come on the pushcarts. I think they just put the most popular things on the carts and hope you don't order more. But the buffet does promise some 65 items or so. And even then we would order 2 baskets of something (because there are 7 of us) and yet only 1 would arrive. The a la carte service is slightly better, though not a whole rating point better. Service aside, the food is worth coming for, which is why we do."

I first went there in 1980: it was amazing then and, I was now delighted to see, it still is amazing ...So many stalls are so very good: there are several good satay stalls (actually they're all good!) while the seafood - particularly the tiger prawns - is wonderful. We especially liked the food from Stall 49 (curiously named 'Denmark Seafood') who seemed to have a symbiotic relationship with Stall 48 ('Sim Huat') who kept us plied with those large bottles of Tiger Beer.At the end of that particular evening these good people bade us goodbye - shaking hands with us - with a cheerful ""see you again"". They will: we will be back!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Anticipation Rewarded,positive,50,11/29/15,"Hosting a birthday party at this restaurant was marked by high anticipation of a rewarding evening. I was not disappointed by either the food or the service. Food quality was high and the service was attentive. Ingredients used were fresh and the cooking was to perfection, whether it was the roasted suckling pig or the winter melon soup or the steamed whole fish.

That is what I always look for! There are pictures and descriptions of every option and all you do is fill in your menu card and the food arrives. The food itself is amazing!Great place to be adventurous in your food selections and for us, we learnt more about how to blend flavours. This is a place we are still talking about and a friend is armed with the address for his visit in the New Year. TIP...... Get there about 1130 or slightly earlier for lunch if you do not like to wait and go armed with accurate directions."
French,Paul,Waiters that behave like headless chickens,negative,10,6-Jul-17,"This restaurant in Paragon should just close down. For me, good food goes with good service because I'm paying for the bill that includes a service charge. I've never been to a so-called restaurant where the service was so atrocious. The waiters were rude and arrogant. The menu looks great but so what when you don't even get served in the first place? Why is it with some of the reviews about their terrible service that this restaurant still continues to operate? The previous restaurant Begazin, was one of the most efficient restaurants we've ever been to. It was nice stopping by for a cup of coffee especially with its great location next to Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. It's shameful in a country like Singapore where efficiency is paramount that this business continues to exist."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Classic style Chinese tea room,positive,40,9/5/2015,Dumplings etc were good and service was very attentive. We were there with our 9-month old twins and the staff were fantastic with them.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow experience - Hawker centre unlike any,positive,50,1-Feb-16,"Visited twice for dinner during my stay in Singapore. Essentially the Hawkers have almost identical food, but what differentiates each of them is the personal touch in the taste based on the hawkers own style conditioned from the individual cultural & regional backgrounds. Must try the Chilli beef and the sting-ray. You can also order beers from and RTD bottles from most of the hawkers and have a drink with your meal. Great place to visit with friends, family or even a lone traveller."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",""" Great meal """,positive,50,26-Sep-13,"I come here through the recommendation of my friend and we don't disappoint. It is a little small room with only 8 seats. Food is very tasty. What is most interesting is watching the chefs make the food funding is fantastic. The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is really cozy. We especially like Shinji and wine here. the food is worth the value and I would recommend them! If you're a sushi fan, you will not be disappointed.."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best sushi in Singapore, but outrageously expensive",positive,50,3-Jun-12,"Having lived in Tokyo for eight years, there are few things I dream of more often than finding great sushi outside of Japan. For Singapore this is it. Unfortunately you feel like you are selling your soul to the devil every time you dine. Its about 75%+ more expensive than comparable quality in Japan. But what to do?"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Nice idli/ dosas,positive,40,22-Mar-16,"Went there early evening last week as had heard a lot about this place from the local Indian community. Was definitely worth visiting if you love idli / dosas , a staple food of South India.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Excellent food quality, bad service, terrible handling of glassware and average value ",negative,30,09/18/16,"Had dinner in this restaurant before leaving Singapore the next day. It 's conviniently located in Marina Manderin Hotel but hard to assess because of the formula one race. The food was lovely, and the chef cooked excellent quality food that we all enjoyed. However, the service was on average only. A waitress accidentally breaked a teacup in our table while serving food, which reflected on the terrible handling of glassware and ruined the overall service and ambience of the restaurant. Otherwise, the service will have been nice. The price was expensive but Reasonable because of the high quality food served. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but not wow,positive,40,3-Jun-16,"Being Asia's #6 best restaurant carries a lot of weight and burden as expectations would be high. To start with the decor and ambience in pleasant and relaxing. Nothing to complain about. The service is exceptional. The waiters are attentive, pleasant and professional. I would give the service 10/10. Now to deal with the food which is the most important element in a restaurant. The dishes are genuine and creative. May by not as one would expect from one of the best restaurants in the world but still there is thought and effort behind the dishes. The taste is good. Some dishes such as the King Crab and the Wagyu Beef were creative as well as tasty. Others were just good, nothing exceptional. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb sushi in Singapore,positive,50,22-Jan-14,"We had lunch at Shinji in the second floor of the Raffles Hotel shopping arcade, and it was a superb meal. Reservations for a Monday at 1:30 pm were easily made the day before. We had the ""9 piece"" set sushi meal, and the quality of the fish, the preparation of the nigiri and maki, and the pacing and sequencing of the meal were as good as we have seen anywhere, including Japan. This was ""edomae"" style sushi, meaning that seasoning is completely under control of the chef. We requested a couple of extras (shirako -in season in Japan- and uni) and these were superlative, but fairly pricy (at about 60 Singapore dollars a serving). So, to keep costs under control, stick to the set course. Regardless, given the superb sushi (and 250 ml of ""Ku"", a daiginjo sake), the total bill of about 400 Singapore Dollars for two was fair and competitive. It would not be that different (in price) from, say, a meal at Le Bernardin in Manhattan (admittedly, a very different kind of seafood cuisine). Only two things detracted from an otherwise perfect lunch. First, the maitre d'hotel was rather pedantic in informing us that extras would be expensive. It's a fair warning, but if coming to Shinji, the client should be prepared to pay dearly (maybe they've had unpleasant experiences with uniformed clients?). Second, the clientele around the sushi bar (and that is all that is available) seemed to be mostly moneyed Philistines, submerging their nigiri into soy sauce (remember, edomae-sushi), photographing each course as it came out, constantly texting, and just generally seeming to be incapable of appreciating what was being served to them. If your meal is helping to drive bluefin tuna to extinction, at least revere the fish. Neither of these issues, especially the second, are responsibilities of the restaurant, but be warned not to expect particularly cultured neighbors. Enthusiastically recommended for those seeking the best sushi money can buy."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A perfect experience,positive,50,30-Jul-16,"We had the incredible privilege of having a private chef in a private room, and the dinner was a delight from start to end."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to have your first dim sum experciences,negative,30,10/24/13,nice place to have your first dim sum experiences.the resturant has the same name as the near by hotel and is a bit hidden behind the shops.the quality and kwantity of the food is good. but it lost its charme and the services is poor.

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner,negative,10,09/23/16,This place i strongly do not recommend as there are many houseflies flying around and disturb me and my friends while we have dinner. Heard is newly open in vivo city at basement 2. Wanted to try out but it was really dissappointing. The food is not tasty at all and to have so many houseflies flying around the table while having meal is horrible. All the service staffs are not attentive at all. Horrible horrible please do not waste your money.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","No longer cheap, but better than ever.",positive,40,28-Jun-16,"The Newton Circus of old, and what exists now. are world's apart. The food hasn't changed much (it was always worth having), but the physical setting has, and it is much for the better. It is brighter, cleaner, and amazingly efficient. But beware, the seafood dishes can be very expensive."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",All the gourmet food you can think of!,positive,50,20-Jan-16,"I've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney and I loved it so I was very excited to go to the one in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the new trendy hotel, Marina Bay Sands. It was around 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it was closer to Casino and the shops and the restaurant was on the second floor. Welcomed warmly by the staff, we sat in the very private room in front of the teppanyaki grill. We ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate the night ($50 per glass, the drinks are very expensive) and the chef brought out all the ingredients that they were going to use. The menu was not on the website and they don't give it to you till the end of the night (this part was the same as the Tetsuya's in Sydney). The menu included carpaccio of flounder with bitter salad, marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar (signature dish), slow cooked New Zealand John Dory with charcoal grilled eggplant, puree of potato with soft poached egg (onset eggs) truffle and caviar, warm salad of abalone with asparagus and Chinese olive, braised Canadian lobster with tarragon, Japanese wagyu (Shiga, and it was A5 rank) with fresh wasabi and ponzu, and then a rice or a noodle dish to finish then gyokuryo (highest quality green tea) and two desserts. Overall, amazing food and service, I enjoyed a nice interaction with the chef. When you pay $450 per person, it's a bit hard to get something wrong. Everything was perfect. The sommelier was knowledgeable, we had a lovely cocktail made by a very polite bar person and our floor staff was very attentive. The hard thing for these restaurant is that people have different expectations so if one small thing goes wrong or it's not what they were expecting, people do get very disappointed. The food was cooked to perfection and I couldn't fault the service. Tetsuya is a world known chef and I loved his food. A lot more seafood compared to Sydney and I would have to say that the food was more Japanese then the one in Sydney. I had a glass of sake after the champagne instead of wine but I would recommend wine with the meal as well. They have a great extensive list of sake and wine and the sommelier is there to give you any advise. It's a once in a life time experience, but if you go, don't expect anything and just enjoy the night. Ask questions to the chef, they are more than happy to explain anything if you are interested. It's an amazing experience no questions asked about that."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy yummy in my tummy!,positive,50,15-Jan-14,"Delicious authentic food, true delicious fast food! Read all the tips and reviews before and felt ready to order appropriately when we went with our 2 kids. Was advised by a stall owner not to walk around and haggle over price, had also read this before. Headed straight to Mrs Tan at stall 70. What a gem. Ordered plenty under her recommendation but not ridiculous. Absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere. Going back tomorrow. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,over the top,negative,30,11/19/14,"Drunken prawns in a herbal soup broth and bamboo calms is to die for. The warm herbal broth was delicious,. I strongly recommend this to any first-time diners to Long Beach! Disappointed with long beach's seafood at Dempsey. Somehow i think the outlet at east coast is better. The chilli crabs we had didn't seem very fresh, and the sauce was all watery. Black pepper crab was the star of the night. It seems like its targeting more for tourists, Service is so so, fish soup, yes it taste good but very expense.For a restaurant that pride itself with seafood and crab.The crab meat was not firm at all and its claw meat was not body fill,for the price we paid it was robbery on Dempsey road."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great food but costly,positive,40,8-Nov-17,"The food here is good, I would expect people to come here for North Indian cuisine.Food quality is good, options are aplenty & the head waiter is very courteous. We had food there about 3 times during our stay and the cost worked out to be approximately 50 SGD per couple (2 adults and 1 child) per meal. That is costly considering that we averaged 50 SGD for two couples per meal at just about every other place.Go there for a change and be ready to be left with just that in your pockets :)"
French,Paul,"Good for lunch on the run, nice decor, food very good.",positive,40,16-Nov-17,"Upon approaching Paul in Ngee Ann City we were immediately met by staff who promptly found us a free table at a busy time of the day. A menu was quickly produced and the specials explained. We sought a casual light lunch and were not disappointed; the soup, filled rolls and beverages were very good. The atmosphere was humming as customers came and went at regular intervals. The inside ""dining area"" had stylish décor which added some class to a basically casual, quick stop venue. The staff were friendly and helpful at every turn, helping us with directions as we continued our retail therapy."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average taste of food,negative,30,12/28/17,"The food is ranked averagely. But the service crew is very friendly. Food ordered are Pork belly + duck rice, soup, prawn Che Cheon Fun, Sao Bao and spring roll Che Cheong Fun."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very std but still a decent choice..they need to just push a little hard,negative,30,3-Sep-17,"I have been to Kailash Parbat a few times. So it means its not bad and you can repeat it, but then its also pretty std stuff and what you want you need to know.Their chole bhatura platter is very good. So are their chaats. But they are pretty pricey. This time I tried their north indian food and I came away unimpressed.We ordered Garlic nanns, which even when hot have a a rubbery texture. They definitely need to look at their flour preparation. We order shaahi paneer and it was white gravy based which is wrong, no issues, the gravy is fine, not great, but its the paneer that kills it. Its not at all soft. This is a shocker. There are many places in singapore that serve very soft paneer , why cant they get it. I am sure their own chefs would admit this is not the kind of paneer that works.On top of it their rates are significantly high. for these rates I woudl rather go to another restaurant that serves much better north indian cuisine. so its a ok and decent place if you know what to order. but nothing great about it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Rude manager,negative,20,07/26/16,"Food delicious but Manager attitude was terrible.We brought our overseas relatives to lunch at Yum Cha Chinatown Restaurant.We were assigned to the table beside a cabinet which initially we thought is for decoration purpose.Suddenly, a Manager in white polo shirt went to open the cabinet, he didn't tell us to give way. Instead he chase away our elderly guest who was sitting closest to the cabinet without waiting for her to stand up and move. Luckily she did not get hurt from this sudden action.The manager even blamed her for sitting there and blocking his way. Since the restaurant assigned us that particular table and we sat as per their seat arrangement, why are we blamed for sitting next to the cabinet?If this cabinet need to be opened often, why they set the seat just besides it? If due to space constraint, manager should know that this condition is not customer's fault."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the Seafood Scams,negative,10,26-Oct-14,"If you are not careful you will be ripped off here by unscrupulous seafood stall holders. The one who took us for a ride was from Stall 23, Takara Grilled Seafood.It works like this: - Friendly host escorts you to a table and brings out his colourful menu. Most of the prices on the menu are reasonable. - He strongly recommends the grilled prawns, listed at $8 per 100 grams, and suggests two each is about right. You agree because it is a marketplace and everything else looks reasonable. - The prawns come, they are OK. - As soon as you finish them, he comes and whisks the platter away. So no evidence!! - When the bill comes, your prawns cost about $20 each (i.e. 250 grams), and you have no way of disproving it.Unfortunately this is one of those episodes where the mistake we made was trusting a friendly local person."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food !!!,positive,50,28-May-16,"On the way to the center of the city, Newton Hawker Centre has a variety of options.

Set within Takashimaya department store, the restaurant has views looking onto Orchard Road or within the store itself. The standard Paul's menu has crepes, salads and other delicious meals. We have been here 4 times now for lunch or afternoon tea. While we enjoyed the food, each time we left feeling annoyed and disappointed with the service. Orders were half delivered, items were forgotten, we had to ask for milk for tea several times."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Reasonably Priced Buffet,positive,40,07/31/13,"The dim sum buffet offers good value and selection. The quality was above average as compared to other dim sum outlets out there.Service wasn't the best but I've experienced worse. They do seem short of staff during peak hours, hence, the slower service.As for comments on being charged for napkins, tea and peanuts, from my experience, it seems like a fairly normal practice here for Chinese restaurants. You can opt not to have the peanuts and napkins by returning them if you do not want to pay for them."
French,Saveur,Unimpressive!!!,negative,10,31-May-14,"As much as we appreciate new trends in recipes and food presentation, we cannot lose track of the traditional ones.Some recipes just cannot be changed in the name of creativity.The spaghetti carbonara we had was atrociously un-Italian.What were they thinking?A version of Italian ""laksa""???Even the Bolignese tasted like a microwaveable TV dinner.Fresh ingredients please and keep it simple.Im sure freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano would be nice instead of pre- packed Kraft.And please inform your staff of the existence of pepperoncino a.k.a chilli flakes.This is plainly a fancy restaurant with sub-,standard food."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice duck & dim sum,positive,40,8/4/2016,"Went there for lunch with my in-laws and family. Ordered the duck dish, char siew, roasted, pandan snow custard bun and signature black pepper London Duck bun. The char siew was made from more fatty meat and tasted a little spongy. The duck, pandan snow bun and roasted pork were nice. However we found the black pepper London duck bun was too spicy and peppery. Perhaps should have tried the London Duck Snow bun."

Had a really bad start with a waitress and owner. there was a bug on the menu, and we casually mentioned it to waitress. Her response was ""it's just a little bug"". For a restaurant, dont think that's acceptable. Owner came by, and was unapologetic. Said something like ""do you think that's an issue?"". Also, asked for an extra chair for some bags. Was turned down curtly by same waitress and without much attempt or sincerity. (the other waiters were great though)Finally, asked to change a waitress. Food was ok, but honestly will not recommend nor return. Perhaps it's because we're a table of locals, but we were definitely not accorded fair respect."

Chinese,Crystal Jade,dim sum in Singapore?,positive,40,10/11/2011,"Prawn dumpling, common yet rather difficult to get good quality ones. This restaurant is one of few that we proud to recommend for dim sum breakfast. My kids love the steam prawn dumpling and my mum like the carrot cake. Our favourite is the outlet at Holland Village, you can dine in at 9am and still manage to get your supper at 1am in the morning!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak and fries,negative,30,25-Sep-14,"We dined at their Suntec City branch. This restaurant was recommended by a friend and we really came here just for the steak and fries, which didn't disappoint. It was not the best steak but was pretty good. It was cooked according to our preference and I was a big fan of the sauce.I also ordered a glass of their red wine (Bordeaux) which went perfectly with the steak. For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel lava cake which was also pretty good."

French,Angelina_MBS,Food & cakes not to expectation,negative,30,12-Feb-17,"Tried for the first time but disappointed. Mains are not worth the price. Understand that cakes are meant to be sweet but the taste of ""white sugar"" is too strong, tried Mont Blanc, it is bad. Think the chocolate croissant is better. Dine in & spent closed to $180 & packed the half eaten Mont Blanc but was charge $1 for a small box."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi lover must try,positive,50,28-Apr-18,"We came here because it's located inside St Regis where we stayed. Our friends already told us this is one of the best Japenese restaurants in Singapore. We sat at the sushi counter facing our chef. We then ordered one Omakase & one sushi lunch with a bottle of sake recommended by the chef. Everything was so perfect with delicious food. The sashimi & sushi were all very fresh. I love the dessert which was a rice cracker shell with green tea ice cream, Very comfortable atmosphere & the guests including us just focused on the food well prepared by our chefs. It's pricey but we got what we paid for: quality food, excellent chef, perfect service and nice/quiet ambience. "

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs and More,positive,40,10/23/16,I usually bring overseas guests to this place as they normally stay around Orchard Road. The old colonial buildings are always a conversation piece.The chilli and pepper crabs are always well received by my guests. I must add that they are actually fantastic and spiciness tweaked to guests preference! The service is also great....maybe since I am there often. And they serve my favourite Erdinger beer!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really Awful Experience,negative,10,3-Dec-16,"Had a really awful experience. Made reservations for 630pm and reached there at 645 pm due to heavy traffic (Standard Chartered Marathon - road closure). Reservations were given away - claimed that our booking was 6 pm instead of 630 pm from their system and they sent SMS confirmation with we did not receive. If we did, we could have changed because it was not what we wanted. Winnie the manager was very adamant - although system is as good as what staff key in (garbage in garbage out) because we booked via phone not internet. No apologies only impoliteness. I would not recommend the place at all neither would my family / and I ever patronise this restaurant. Very poor customer service...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good sashimi, no desserts",positive,40,29-Jan-18,"Sashimi was excellent, but could use more variety overall. Would have been better if they provided some desserts to round off the meal."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Food Good Service,positive,40,12/18/13,"Signature dishes like wagyu beef with longan and wasabi-mayonnaise prawns continued to be very good. Service personnel were very courteous and professional. We couldn't decide on the choice of noodle or rice. Service attendant politely recommended their one of their specialty fried rice, which was a very good choice. He also asked if we wanted the dishes served at the same time (like typical Chinese family meal) or one after another (like Western meals).Restaurant ambience was good - background music didn't overpower conversations, window view of MBS, S'pore Flyer, Mandarin Oriental Hotel & sky made the restaurant bright and wide (not claustrophobic) & pleasant Chinese decor.Complimentary parking is available when dining payment is S$50 or more."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nicely Different, but be cautious over selling but stall owners.",positive,40,23-Sep-14,"In all my years of traveling to Singapore I have never been to a Hawker Centre. It's cheap eating that resembles a food court in an American Mall. I wish I had know about these before, as they could have saved me a whole lot of time and money. A huge variety of foods, that is served quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately we got duped into buying large prawns which were hugely expensive, so make sure you keep track of what you have ordered and the price you ordered it at. I would defiantly go back, time, and time again, but obviously have learned from my previous mistake. Great atmosphere, with locals, expats, and tourists."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Great Idlis & other South Indian dishes,positive,40,28-Mar-16,"If you love Idlis and Dosas, this is the place to be. Amazingly soft Idlis served hot with various kind of chatnis (sauces). Dosas & Uttapams are great too. Fast service."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Modrate Japanese Fare,negative,30,26-Jun-18,"Environment of restaurant comfortable and spacious. Staff able to respond for service. However, have seen better quality of Japanese buffet food elsewhere. Although electronic pad is used for making orders, there still seem to be items not being served. Thought that electronic orders would somehow be captured by the chefs and the service staff. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Sashimi Quality but super slow service,negative,30,31-Mar-17,"Food service was slow. Had to do multiple reminders to service staff for my hand rolls but it wasn't served at all. On the bright side, Sashimi cut was fresh and thick. Their grilled spread was good. Their crab croquette was nice. Point is their food was good but due to the slow service, we couldn't eat much and got tired of waiting. And once it hit 230pm, food service stopped. Surprisingly, the table on our right had all their orders even though they arrive later than us. The table on our left was surprised that table had all their orders fulfilled without any glitches yet we were left hanging on several dishes and had to remind the service staff again and again. There were guests being placed in partitioned tables with a board like in a library. Probably won't go back again during lunch time due to their lack of service."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great food and place for celebration ,positive,50,02/22/17,"Booked Peach blossoms for a team dinner and was very satisfied with the overall experience. The food esp the scallop crab meat fish roe and mushroom was delicious. The service by Terry, Noble, Sook Teng, Lee Lee, Christine and Mun Fung was good as well. We have a enjoyable celebration and dinner. Thanks to Terry also for the great plate art and poem which is also another key highlight. Will definitely visit again. "

The food was stunning, the staff outstanding and the attention to detail in the ambience of the place made the whole evening memorable. The chef's signature dishes were amazing. I was the only vegetarian person in the group and that certainly did not cause any issues at all and the soup of avocado with potato ice cream and tonburi at the start sent me to heaven straight away! Make sure you book as that is the only way you can guarantee a table."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Private Room - Privilege Service,positive,40,02/29/16,"It was a business dinner and we were allocated 2 private rooms with a great view of the greenery behind Long Beach @ Dempsey. Our VIPs from Europe and UK were very pleased with this view as we sip beers and discuss about various matters.Having been to Long Beach @ Dempsey for many times, it seems dishes served to private rooms are of higher quality in terms of flavor and decoration. At least, this time round, the food was excellent and our visitors very much enjoyed their meal to the last piece.The captains were attentive with our requests. They paid good attention to our VIPs, for example, servicing them with apron when the ever famous chili crab dish was served. Of course, they never forget us too! Fully pleased with the services.We will continue to recommend this place for Business Dinners if VIPs are interested in excellent seafood and peaceful greenery."
French,Saveur,"Nice food, with reasonable pricing",positive,40,24-Apr-17,"Ordered duck confit, truffles fries and new addition in their menu - chilli crab squid ink pasta! the pasta was awesome, with the addictive sauce. worth a try!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't be shy!,positive,50,22-Apr-14,"We were recommended this by a taxi driver who we asked to take us to East Coast. 15 minutes later with a list of what to ask for and how to ask we were dropped off and entered the centre. Its an outdoor hexagon shaped area with seating in the middle and under cover. Probably around 30 restaurants selling seafood and satay etc. We had the chilli crab 38 Singapore dollars and BBQ stingray 18 dollars which was a first and absolutely delicious. Tiger beer must be the cheapest in town 7 dollars for a big bottle. You eat of plastic plates with plastic cutlery, but its an experience that makes a difference and you should try as an alternative or as well as the big seafood places. You won't be sorry. We went as a family of 4 including 5 and 2 year olds and all had a great time."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",love this place,positive,50,27-Aug-17,sashimi are thickly sliced and there are a widespread of variety for cooked food. came here multiple times and still loving it!
French,Angelina_MBS,Good brand but poor service,negative,10,23-Oct-15,The food is so so but after our meal they charged us twice on our credit card with same bill by recieving alert twice to handphone! We did complain but no responsible until we call our bank to cancel one bill of charging! Later we show the charging transaction from the bank and the duty manager wont accept the mistake! So far that bring down the so call six stars venue... Hmmm
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place to have Indian food,positive,40,1-Mar-15,"Kailash Parbat is right on the junction of Syed Alwi Road in Little India. Its the best place around for North Indian food. Do try Chole Bhature if you are there. The menu is good with a decent spread across Indian Snacks and Main Course. A pure veg restaurant, decently priced and good seating space. Masala tea is rocking :). During our 5 nights stay in Parkroyal on Kitchener road, this was our first go-to place for Dinner."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",BEST,positive,50,5-May-15,This is simply the best indian restaurant in Singapore. The dishes are always mouthwatering and always varieties are offered on the buffet. I love Tandoori Chicken specially and always ove to come here.
French,Paul,Not French Cuisine,negative,20,22-Jan-14,"We visited the restaurant in Ngee Ann City in Singapore last night. All we wanted was a quick dinner so we thought we would give the outlet a try. We were here 2/3 years ago when it opened and walked out due to the total lack of service. Tonight the greeting was quicker and more professional. I ordered the beef steak. It had almost no flavour and very little to commend it all. The gravy tasted as if it was an instant gravy mix and had just been mixed with water and poured over. The saute potatoes were soft and soggy. The speed with which the meal arrived should have set some warning bells ringing. I sense the possible use of a microwave.My partner went for seafood meal which consisted of 2 mussels and 2 prawns in a bechamel sauce. He tells me it tasted of wallpaper paste, but I am not sure how he knows this.To drink we had Orangina which I imagine it would be difficult to mess up. The total bill was SGD77 which was very much overpriced for the food we received.I noticed at a nearby table that the main course of the diners meal arrived before they had finished their starter. The restaurant needs to do something about timing. Most of the staff looked totally bored and they didn't seem as though they wanted to be there. I know how they feel!!!If you find yourself in Singapore this is one eatery to give a miss. However, to establish some balance I have to tell you that the breads and pastries in the takeaway shop looked excellent. It may be case of a touch of diversity in the products on offer going a step too far."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Varieties of different Foods,negative,30,13-Nov-15,"Went to Newton Hawker Center where the choice of food is endless ranging from Malay, Chinese, Curries,and many desserts. At each table there is number, which you need to inform food staller so he can bring your order. Please bring your own napkins as I found out that most eateries do not supply .The food at Newton Hawker Center is relatively inexpensive. We had Hainese Chicken with rice which cost about $5 and also Tom Yum Shrimp noodle soup for $5 for dinner. Both dishes were Ok, but you can do better Lau Pau Sat Food Center which has over 200 food stalls and it is cheaper."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not like the old place, bit of a rip off",negative,30,14-Feb-15,"Last time we were in Singapore we visited the original Newton Circus hawker market. It was great food,great atmosphere and fantastic value for money. The new sanitised version is OK, but comes no where near the original. Food was advertised as very reasonable however when you ask for the bill it has shot up dramatically. We had; small rice, small noodles, large shrimp, chillie shrimp and spicy chicken. We expected about 75 to 80 Singapore dollars, it came in at 120??? No written bill and no explanation . Food is ok but you can eat better and cheaper in the city."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,OK food and bad service,negative,20,11/6/2017,The food in this restaurant was ok. The duck was good. The roast pork was ok. The carrot cake was soggy and tasted awful. The vegetable dishes and the carbs were all just ok.What was really bad about this restaurant was the service. The restaurant was understaffed and the waiters were simply overwhelmed. Some of them seemed very uninterested in serving the customers. I had to ask five times for rice and condiments. This needs to be improved.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistently Very GOOD!!,positive,50,12-Apr-17,Our go-to-place to get our Steak-fix. Always good quality and very yummy!!! Good value for money :))

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",The softest idlis I've ever eaten,positive,50,18-Mar-16,"For the softest idlis, four different chutneys and strong coffee, go to Murugans. Their menu is limited but what's on there is excellent."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Most Amazing Dining Experience!!,positive,50,28-May-12,"Most incredible dining experience....every course was special...the sea urchin was super....as was the alaskan lobster....the teppanyaki chef was proffessional and charismatic...every course had me feeling that it was unique and flavourful and the best so far...until the next one came along!!!And just when we thought it cdnt get any better...we were ushered into the desert salon for more amazing delights....even the petit four was divine...in spite of the steep prices, I cant recommend it highly enough...I wd do it all over again in a heartbeat!!The stunning ambience and fabulous wine selection doesnt hurt either!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker experience: things you should know!,negative,30,3-May-12,"After the cab dropped us off at the center we were a bit overwhelmed by the activity. Here are some tips that I wish I had known 1. Be ready to be approached by all vendors particularly the high margin seafood vendors2. Take your time, walk around and find a seat near a stall that appeals to you. They will bring the food to your dedicated table.3. keep in mind that the seating area is a public space, and not owned by the seafood guys who will thrust a menu in your face. If you want satays, sugar cane juice and beers only, then no problem; no obligation to order from them.4. If you want the seafood which is indeed fresh, be sure to inspect it checking for size of claws and have it weighted. I was missing a gigantic claw, they just shrugged and walked away.5 . Aside from the missing claw, we had lots of fun and enjoyed this experience.Next time I will try Maxwell hawker center for greater authenticity and less wheeling dealing."
French,Paul,Overpriced,negative,20,5-Feb-17,"Food was average at best. Chocolate tart was the only decent thing. Iced coffee was comparable to Nescafé 3in1 coffee.
Won't return again"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Love the sushi,positive,50,30-Jun-15,"I love the sushi there. The service staff and sushi chef are friendly. They can speak good English so don't worry if you don't speak Japanese. They carry good range of sakes. You can ask for sushi bar counter when you make reservation. Most of the time it is full so please make reservation in advance especially weekend is very crowded. Recently they have just renovated the restaurant, but not much different (extra private dining area). The ingredients are fresh and mostly imported."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satays Galore,positive,50,6-Nov-15,"If you are looking for cheap and reasonable eateries, this is it! Good variety of Asian and freshly squeezed juices, beer and what ever drink takes your fancy. You just have to visit just once and make your mind up."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ask the price before you order!,negative,30,22-Nov-11,"We went to Newton on recommendation of the taxi driver- it looked a fun place to go, as it was, very evocative of the amosphere of Singapore. There were many ""trawlers"" trying to lure you to their tables- we were seduced by giant barbecued garlic prawns and chilli crab- which were delicious and we enjoyed- until we recieved the bill! 144Sin$ for a meal for two with plastic plates and knives and forks. Left feeling somewhat taken for a ride. The Singaporeans have heard that this place is expensive, the system seems to be go round to the stalls and pay as you go, do not accept what is brought to you and then pay later!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak to my heart...,positive,40,22-Sep-17,"Ordered the onion soup, and for mains I had the classic steak and fries, which comes with a nice side salad so you get your greens too!

Go big or go home, full of yummy steak in ya belly... "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Overrated on reflected glory,negative,30,5-Dec-17,Booking time and table not honoured by them. Made us sit in the open air heat and humidity. Tasty food but 'all served cold'. Upon complaint they picked up the dishes and 're-warmed' them. Such food gets soggy and disintegrates. Re-warmed meat can be upsetting...More

French,Paul,Decent food but chaotic service,negative,20,2-Jan-17,"The pros : classical Paul products The cons : is there someone managing this restaurant ? All staff seem to be running around without any coordination. Tables aren't cleared quickly, causing people to queue even with tables available (albeit not clean).

Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dumplings and other asian treats,positive,40,02/26/13,My son loves soup dumplings and Crystal Jade do them well. There is an excellent range of items to choose from and the pricing is good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very fat duck indeed!,negative,30,03/25/16,I find the restaurant name cute although I can't quite connect London and fat duck. The food served here is Cantonese cuisine. Roasted duck is very fatty and a little too salty so this experience may be rather scary for health conscious eaters. I prefer the Char Siew meat as it is pretty well done. Food quality is good but not exceptional. I do know of hawker stalls that serve similar or higher quality roasted duck.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food and atmosphere,positive,50,27-May-13,A very relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere at this clean food centre. Food is inexpensive and delicious!! Particularly the chicken murtabak.

It actually tasted nice if it was warm. The fish was bland.We gave feedback that the food was cold.After payment, the staff came to explain that because of our feedback, the service recovery was to waive the cost of ice water. According to him, that's the best the ground staff could do. We didn't even expect to pay for Ice water in the first place!Needless to say, we won't be eating there again!"

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good only if you order whole duck,positive,40,8/3/2016,"Make sure to 'order only' the whole duck so you can be sure of the parts given.I came here once for a single portion meal accompanied with noodle, and I was given a few pathetic pieces of boney-parts with hardly any meat. I was so disappointed. It gives me the impression that they're serving left-over parts taken from 'whole' duck orders from others "
French,Paul,Poor Poor service !,negative,10,23-Jan-16,"This so called manager of your paragon outlet has really disappointed us with her level of service . We were seated by your waitering staff at a table and offered a menu. After 10 mins, I waved to this manager for an order , she walked pass and said she will be with us shortly . However , 10 mins passed and she was serving another walkin customer . After which , she went to the kitchen and make her bread?!?. Leaving us stranded for another good 10 mins. Finally decided not to spend my money here and walk off after I gave her a telling off. She seems to realized she forgot abt us!"
French,Saveur,Cheap French Fine Dining Experience,positive,50,8-Mar-16,"Brilliant main course. Do try their Salted Caramel Chocolate Lava cake. In all a complete value for money. Portions are small, very French indeed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Must visit for people missing indian food in Singapore,positive,50,10-May-14,What more on a holiday could you ask for than good food.!!.. for all veg indian food lovers this place is a must visit in singapore. if you are missing indian food and want to get full with great food this is a place. Great service by the staff. Excellent job they do especially at weekend evening when there is Hours of waiting. But still they get you served asap.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Exclusive Golden Phoenix fish,positive,50,7/9/2016,"We went on a warm evening, and glad we had a ceiling fan at our table. David Ng, assistant manager, really made some great recommendations. We simply had bamboo clams, Hongkong style steam Golden Phoenix fish, mushroom and vegetables. David shared that Long Beach has the exclusive Golden Phoenix fish in Singapore, all imported from Malaysia highlands. I was skeptical as this is a fresh water fish, but it really tasted very good. Will be back!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disaster,negative,20,8-Jul-15,We had a visitor from Europe and my cousin suggested we take him to this place. It was nothing to shout about. Went back again to their other branch with my spouse. The visit just reconfirmed first impression. There is nothing special. It is good for people who want vegetarian food for nostalgic reasons. I would definitely give it a miss. Staff very helpful and friendly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service and food,positive,50,28-Sep-16,"The service was nothing short of great! Albeit the seating arrangements was not what I expected and was disappointed, (I had 14 pax but they had to split us), thr expectations of service and food was beyond."
French,Paul,French bakery,positive,40,27-Dec-13,"Paul, is a French bakery and restaurant chain that was first set up in Croix in 1889. They now have many branches all over the world. I have been to some in the Middle East. They now have 5 branches in Singapore.Some of their food is quite nice, their desserts nice but look better and their bread very nice. If you're in the mood for a nice evening with a bottle of wine and some runny or smell delicious French cheese, get the bread from Paul. Their bread is ideal for eating with soft French cheese."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Pricey,negative,30,7-Feb-09,Pricey
French,Paul,Awful food & service - don't go!,negative,10,31-Aug-17,"Just dreadful - service is simply grotesque - slow, entirely inattentive and seemingly focused on just getting through the day... painful to watch but even worse to experience.Food is mediocre at best - dishes arriving with 10 minutes interval for a table of 2 for a quiche and a croque-monsieur, bland taste... just very very poor.Don't go there - no other advice would do justice to this place."
French,Saveur,Good service,positive,50,15-Jun-16,Had a birthday celebration there and all was good. We could keep our cake there as well for quite a few hours ahead of our dining time. Service crew was courteous and food was good! Duck confit and truffle mash is the best
French,Paul,Best bread and pastries,positive,40,29-Apr-12,I was looking forward for the opening and Paul meets my expectation. Bread and pastries are the best in town. But I found the restaurant too pricy to seat and take away is a better deal.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious food and great ambience,positive,50,6-Sep-15,"We had dinner here on two consecutive days and we were glad that we found this restaurant. The food was delicious and hot. Typical Indian taste. The place has great ambience. But, the service sometimes is lacking but I think the food makes up for it! Great place to have a meal with family and friends."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Eat till full,positive,40,25-Dec-15,Many items to choose from. Went on Xmas eve and the staff were all helpful and attentive. Worth the money to go!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally overrated - nothing special,negative,20,26-Oct-14,"The style of dining here is interesting. The courses are comprised of excellent quality ingredients, and some are reasonably enjoyable. The sommelier is terrible, and showed no indication of having any knowledge of wine whatsoever - best to make your own choices. Deserts well below average. Overall, very disappointing even without regard to the cost of dining here. There are much better options in Singapore (including, as the last reviewer suggested, The Tippling Club, and Tetsuya's in Sydney is streets ahead."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing experienece,negative,20,1/2/2017,"Food:Roasted pork - the ratio of lean meat, fat, skin is totally wrong. Apparently over-cooked and very hard to chew.Roasted duck - way too dry, way too tough!Shrimp vermicelli roll - there is only 1 shrimp in each roll, which is very absurd. If you are running low on shrimps, then put it as out-of-stock.The only dishes that are okay are shrimp dumpling (har gaw) and egg custard bun.Service:Upon arriving, they couldn't find our reservation (we called like 3 hours ahead to make reservation yet they lost track). And the lady at front desk just pointed at a chair saying ""you sit over there first"" without any apology or politeness. We waited for 15min and no one came to us with any information, hence we had to ask again.The girl named Emma took our order and she is the only one that we find friendly and responsible. After confirming our order, she left the menu with us so we could add on if needed. 2min later, another lady came over (named something like soon teng) and grabbed the menu away. Then she asked whether we've ordered, so we told her that we want to keep the menu. She said okay and placed the menu randomly on another side of the table, blocking the position for serving dishes. The basic courtesy we expect is that she at least places it where she took it, but no."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,positive,40,29-Nov-17,"The selection was quite wide and sashimi was fresh. Especially loved the salmon and swordfish sashimi. The maki rolls were great as well, it was rare to see innovative maki rolls (like rainbow roll, dragon) offered in a buffet instead of the usual California roll. Of course the taste still cannot beat an ala carte order of dragon roll at other japanese restaurant but I am satisfied as it was to have it on the buffet menu. The waiting time can take sometime during busy hours. Best to go early and order quickly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely stunning,positive,50,26-Jul-16,"This is what food should be all about. No fancy cooking, just pure, fresh ingredients with the clever use of condiments and garnishes to bring out or enhance the flavours. The selection of sake is also second to none. You just get the impression that the owner and everybody who works here knows food, knows what they're doing and are passionate about it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tea quality is not good enough. Some dishes are pretty high in price.,positive,40,1/11/2014,"I liked the big selection of different snacks that you can choose from. I disliked the tea they served. I expect better quality tea leaves in a ""Yum Cha Place"". After all, the authentic Yum Cha is having ""tea drinking"" as the core of the enjoyment, supported by snacks of different kinds. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dinner,positive,40,12/4/2015,"This is a wonderful and pleasant place to dine. U could hear the excellent music from the pianist. There is also a nice and charming restaurant manager, Terry, serving you and giving you good recommendations for the food choices."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dumplings in the heart of China Town,positive,40,09/14/14,"Right in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha has the atmosphere revered by locals and tourists alike. It's always packed at lunch hour which ensures freshly baked dumplings by the minute. The crunchy banana& bean paste deep fried dumpling is the best way to finish a large selection of dim sums. And the top it all it's not expensive, always a bonus!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Delightful experience ,positive,50,26-May-18,"Was treated by my wife to a great meal here. We had the ten course degustation set, starting with the carpaccio of snapper with bitter salad, ice plant and Sudachi. This was parried with Billecart Salmon Champagne. The second course was the marinate Boston Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Osietra Urchin. This is the signature dish of the restaurant. It was paired with the Masuizumi Junmqi Daiginjo. Third course was pan seated fillet of Ayi with Daikon and Fennel, paired with Tengumaj GorinFourth course was the Tasmanian Abolone with Aonori, paired with Resling Domaine WeinbachFifth course was Braised Canadian lobster with Tarragon, paired 2016 Pierro Chardonnay Sixth course was charcoal grilled Tasmania beef with 2015 Meo-Camuzet MarsannaySeventh course was Japanese Ohmi Wagyu with Citrus soy, paired with Couvent Des Jacobins. Eighth course wa the framed rice with snapper and consommé, followed by Japanese tea. Desert was Japanese Mandarin GranitaOverall it wa a delightful meal"

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Bad expierence,negative,10,15-May-16,"Came here with my partner and I asked to be sitted inside. The staff that served us wasn't very happy as she sitted us outside. We ordered for Grilled lamb and Sirlion steak but instead of received Grilled Lamb we got smth else instead, my partner was starving so he just ate it. The steak was good and worth the amount paid for which was about $40. Everything else was not worth the price at all. The red house wine was terrible. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant."

The dishes came 1 by 1 and 2 dishes we ordered were not available , also they ran out of fresh coconuts.Either to say we were very disappointed by the whole experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great service. ,positive,50,11/1/2017,"We had our dinner at peach blossom restaurant. The most unforgettable birthday experience we had is from terry lim ,who provided us with the best service. We love the chinese poems with the little figurines on the plate. Great food recommended by him. Really appreciated it. We will be back soon. Thank u . ?? "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The old magic isn't there,negative,20,20-Jan-12,"Since it was renovated, most of the shops aren't there anymore and it's hot and it seems like there are just those seafood shops. I don't go anymore and i used to love it. It's cleaner yes... but less messy totally. I feel the food is just not as good. Although the fish ball noodles and fish hat (yu tiao). So have not been back in almost a year!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Scrumptious,positive,40,13-Nov-12,"One of my favorite places for Indian food. While there are many other more affordable places in Little India, Muthu's is always a crowd pleaser. It's one of my usual picks for Indian food and my friends have always agreed that it's a great choice."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average yumcha good service,negative,30,12/25/13,"I visited this restaurant upon recommendation from my taxi driver.i expected a really awesome culinary experience but it was very ordinary.i had prawn wanton which were cold and too appetising, xiao long bao which was already but broke easily not the best and seafood dumplings that were lacking in flavour.i love dim sum so I was disappointed. The meal was reasonable $4 for each choice.it was very Average"
French,Saveur,Alright experience,negative,30,17-Jan-16,We sat at a corner table that night and food came without a long wait but the ice water we asked for never came even after we finished the meal. And no service staff was around to help us! We were quite disappointed with the service 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable buffet,negative,30,24-Apr-17,"We (family/relatives) decided to try this place out for my birthday. Since we had 10 or 11 people, they gave us a private room. Since this was an ala carte buffet, ordering was done through a tablet. We had to ask for another tablet as 11 people sharing 1 tablet was just ridiculous. Drinks are not included in the buffet, so take note. Service was quite slow. Some of the items we ordered took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Though the buffet was extremely affordable (considering it was serving Japanese cuisine and it was a dinner buffet), the quality of the dishes were not up to standard. The sashimi was relatively fresh. The salmon handroll I ordered was pathetic, there was only a small piece of salmon inside the handroll. (as shown in the photo) The spring rolls were super thin.Overall, I would not recommend coming here if you are picky about the quality of food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It was just average,negative,30,5/2/2016,"No need to queue when I was at the Waterway Point outlet for a weekday late lunch.Tried the mixed roast platter (signature roast duck, crackling pork belly & bbq pork), black pepper bun and wanton noodle.I find the black pepper taste was too strong for the bun. The roast duck was nice, but nothing fantastic. The surprised was the pork belly. The skin was indeed crackling, while the meat was tender."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Traditional and Spicy Indian Food,positive,40,16-Aug-15,"Really great traditional Indian food. they serve really, really good Indian food with the spice and the chutneys. The service is amazing and of course the food is fabulous. The staff is friendly and quick. A great place is your looking for traditional Indian food...More"
French,Paul,Absolutely terrible and not worth it,negative,10,18-Feb-13,"I visited Paul on a Sunday close to lunch time. There wasn't a line when we got there but it was relatively crowded. We got a table immediately. Then it all went downhill. We ordered water, and my glass had a smell. I asked to change it and the waitress brought another glass back and put it on one corner of the table, further away from me, when she knew it was my glass that had the smell. We ordered one Boeuf Tartine and one Crepe Complet. We had to wait for a while for the food. But when it did come, it was not hot, not even warm. It also didn't taste good. Dessert was waffle, which we shared. Again, it took a while to arrive and we had to chase for it. When it did come, it wasn't hot as well! if it took a while to come surely it must mean that it was just cooked and should be hot? It also tasted rather stale. Service staff, while not rude, hardly said anything, and merely gestured. They were however surprisingly friendly and chatty to one table away from us, probably a regular customer. All in, a really disappointing experience and I would not go back again. Neither would I recommend anyone to go there to eat. I've tried their cakes and pastries before, and they are decent. Perhaps visit if you only want cakes, but not for a meal."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha - Nice Dim Sum,positive,50,04/18/13,I like the dishes here coz they are delicious and affordable. Like the push carts ladies selling their wares.

Club sandwich was another disappointing experience -- in fact this was one of good item they served earlier at Syed Alwi Road. But over this place it was horrible --- the potato in the sandwich was without any masala / taste.Overall I strongly recommend the restaurant owner to improve on North Indian food / taste, food should be tasty -- have some energy!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A terrible but expensive dinner,negative,10,10/31/16,"We read the previous reviews & were looking forward to dining here. What a disappointment. The restaurant is very tired looking with dowdy tablecloths, no napkins provided, plastic plates and some of the worst wait staff we have ever experienced. We chose a 5 course set menu for 4 of us and dishes were plonked down on the table in rapid succession, regardless of whether we had finished a course or not. The miserable waitress splashed us with sauces as she dished up & we had to use the tablecloth to cover our clothes as best we could. The food was poorly presented and whilst the razor clams and pepper crab were tasty, the rest of it was bland and tasteless. They rushed us through all 5 courses within 45 minutes. This was truely the worst dinner we have ever experienced. "
French,Poulet,good food,positive,40,29-Feb-16,we were really just walking around the place looking for somewhere to eat and i'm so glad we came across this restaurant. their escargot was so good and the roast chicken with chardonnay sauce was excellent! everything else was good too.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Huge portions, great service!",positive,50,4-Oct-12,"Me and my husband visited the restaurant whilst on honeymoon. We'd just arrived in Singapore and we came across the restaurant on a walk by the river. The waitress quickly organised a table for us, gave us menus and took our drinks order. The menu does not offer a huge list of choice but the 'steaks and fries' dishes that are available, left me with a tough decision, they all sounded delicious! we ordered starters which were lovely but when the main courses arrived I wished we'd not had them as the portion was huge. The rib eye steak although about the same price you'd expect to pay in the uk was twice the size and perfectly cooked to my request of medium rare. Then the fries... I don't know how they cooked them but they were the best fries I've ever had! A whole mountain of them and they were 'free flowing' ...the waitress actually asked if I wanted more! All in all we left very satisfied, the perfect start to our 3 night visit to Singapore. The staff made sure our glasses were topped up all night and were very polite and friendly. The only negative I will mention is that the tables are very close together so its not somewhere to dine if you want privacy but other than that I would recommend it to anyone in Singapore."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Hidden Gem,positive,50,28-Oct-12,"I was at the Upper Circular restaurant with my wife and mother-in-law and I was greeted by a very smiley gentleman, who helped us to a table outside.

French,Paul,The quality of food is average only,negative,30,6-Jul-15,"I happened to dine in this restaurant with my mom on Sunday July 5, as all the other restaurants in Takashimaya are fully booked. We had the mushroom soup, which was not too creamy, and not too fattening. However, the bread that came with it was really hard, that my mom nearly cracked her teeth with them. The garlic bread was also no better, as they used the same texture that made the bread. My mom and I shared a club sandwich. Seriously, they are a bit too bland and tasteless, that even the sandwich made by my maid at home is better than theirs. They are obviously short of staff too, as it takes them a while to clear our plates. May not go back again, as maybe their food is not to us the taste of the Asian people."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",jap buffet,positive,40,27-Oct-17,quite a variety of food. sashimi is fresh and tasty. other cooked foods are so-so. desserts and beverages not included in the buffet and chargeable. service is so-so.

Upon arrival you are directed to the table, no smiles.. Sit and be prepared to be yelled at. Staff are extremely rude, but they do attend to the table... The way they express them themselves is rather aggressive... Anyway...We ordered a few of their signature dishes... Peking duck is a waste of money, duck was dry, pancakes tiny! Waste of stomach space. We ordered a beef dish, ohhhhhh that was the toughest and piece of meat ever. The other thing that disturbs me whilst try to eat my meal is the constant staring by all staff members .Awkward night out, in terms of food, I would never recommend this to anyone I know. It's not cheap either."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food experience,positive,50,1-Mar-15,"The concept is nice, the chef is cooking in front of you, you get the see the products before they are cooked, everything is perfect even if the seating is not very sociable as guests are aligned in front of the cooking table so difficult to interact with the other person but the one next to you. The food was absolutely amazing and so was the wine. At the end of the meal you are taking to a salon to have your dessert and coffee. The cake was really good ( not often the case in Asia !!!) and the staff is really helpful and friendly. It does come with an hefty bill to match though so be prepared to spend some serious cash to have this amazing experience."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Birthday celebration,positive,50,10/4/2017,"Have not been here for many years. Husband reminded me of it so I booked a table for a Saturday dinner.We were promptly greeted at the entrance. As we booked for an early time slot, restaurant was quite empty at that time.The staff took our orders very quickly and made good suggestions on what we could order. My son was eager to eat the famous Singapore chili crab with mantou, a kind of fried bun. Supposed to dip buns in the crab gravy, really yummy stuff!We also ordered fried baby squid, prawn fritters, beef rice noodles, fried rice, venison, etc. Food standard is still high compared to last time. The only downside of the restaurant is no sheltered car park. It was drizzling when we reached there so had to look for brollies in the car. Overall it was an enjoyable experience dining at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant as staff were attentive and food was good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-priced duck and pathetically small portion,negative,20,5/5/2016,"We were at the Waterway Point outlet last evening for dinner. Needed to wait 20 to 30 minutes for a table on a weekday night. We were attracted by the long queue to try the food there. The portions were pathetically small. Unreasonably over priced for everything, especially for the plate of duck noodles with only four thin slices of duck meat @$8.80 and tasted bland. When you asked for chilli, the waitress would forget totally even though you reminded her twice. That would be our first and last visit to London Fat Duck."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth it!,positive,50,5-Sep-11,I ate here 2 weeks ago and had such a good experience! They only serve a 10-course degustation menu worth SGD 400. It is pricey but definitely worth it. See my blog entry for details of what I thought about each of the 10 courses:http://goodfoodishappiness.blogspot.com/2011/08/waku-ghin-japanese-fine-dining-and.htmlShould be worth a try for special occasions and that once in a lifetime experience!

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",tasty north-indian vegitarian food,positive,40,2-Aug-16,"It has become my most favorite Indian vegetarian restaurant over couple of years, it is bit pricy due to the quality of the food they serve. It is best place for chat (paani/dhahi/bhel poori etc), roti/naan basket with assorted naans are awesome. Four of us including two kids went there last week, we ordered quite few items like couple of veg curries, 2 assorted naan baskets, dhahi poori etc, bill was 90+ SGD. You can get the same food within 50-60SGD in other restaurants around Syed Alwi Road but not the quality. Very conveniently located opposite Mustafa shopping Centre. Note: longer waiting time during weekends, not a place for south Indian food."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but Fantastic,positive,50,8-Nov-16,"There is a tendency with expensive, top flight restaurants for snobby reviewers to pretend the food is only so-so. No question it is expensive, too expensive in comparison to some other meals we've spent $1k and above on (Atelier Crenn and E by Andres come to mind immediately), but several of the dishes were phenomenal. The cost, I'm certain, is due to the quality of the ingredients, none of which come cheap.With 10 courses, we passed on the wine pairing, which we almost never do, but we worried about the noted 8 pours in 10 courses, and they wouldn't let us share a tasting. We opted for two glasses each, and all the by the glass choices were high quality, among the best in the world.1) Hanadai - fantastic sushi dish to start off the tasting.2) Waku Ghin's signature dish - marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Hard to go wrong with these ingredients, and it was as good as advertised.3) Seared amadai w/mushrooms, another solid dish.4) Special - it's white truffle season! A generous portion (to match the sky high price) of white alba truffles went over a potato puree with a poached egg and caviar. The highlight of the evening for both my wife and I.5) Steamed king crab - great show, steamed over a mound of salt, with a lime sauce that created the best crab dish I've ever had.6) Abalone - this was the one miss. The abalone at French Laundry was unbelievable - best I've ever had, and Waku Ghin's was tough and unpleasant - a disappointing dish.7) Lobster - braised slowly in front of us while the previous two dishes were cooked. Very tasty, but not as flavorful as I expected.8) Wagyu w/wasabi. With these ingredients, you can't go wrong, and it was phenomenal.9) Steamed rice consommé - an incredibly elevated play on miso soup - a highlight for me.10) Traditional japanese green tea - a very pleasant end to the savory courses.11) Honey ice cream w/lemon granita, very tasty.12) my wife got what she said was the best rice pudding she's ever had, and my chocolate mousse was solid.Overall, a phenomenal meal in a fun teppan setting. It's hard to meet sky high expectations, but while I'd like the price to have been less, the crab, sea urchin, and wagyu were world class dishes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Long wait for slightly above average food,negative,30,08/23/15,"Arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night and saw a small crowd already waiting. Was told the wait will be about 20 mins which was acceptable but instead we waited for almost 45 mins before given a table for 7 of us.As mentioned the place is more a cafeteria style whereby you select from the order chit the food you wanted. Looking at the prices, would same it is reasonable considering the location and service is much better than expected.The side dishes such as the porridge is good as well as the duck bun.However the duck as mentioned is very fatty to suit me though the skin is rightly roasted. They should work on improving the choices of vegetables though as there is only 1 item. Overall the price is reasonable but not worth the wait."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but an experience,positive,50,4-Dec-16,The variety of dishes offered by the place is phenomenal. Every restaurant should learn how the food should be cooked and served. The good things come at a price so be ready to sacrifice your wallet there :-)

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience...,positive,50,18-Mar-13,"The most amazing gillardeau oysters, they are the creme de la creme of the oyster world... The trout is to die for! And the seafood salad a great sashimi plate. This was just the bar menu you have to go here....!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent,positive,50,8-Apr-17,"This was our second visit. As we both adore the vast arrangement of the desserts, we opted to share a main, and share 3 desserts ! The steak was beautiful, perfectly cooked to our requirements. We were advised that as we were sharing a main, that ""free flow"" of fries would not be available, but we could not finish the huge amount that was served to us! The desserts are stunning, great choice and a good size. A joy to return. "
French,Paul,SUPER FRENCH CAFE IN THE HEART OF ORCHARD ROAD,positive,50,23-May-18,"Well done! Enjoyed the wide variety of food choices available! Good quality of French pastries and croissants.

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Exactly what the shop name says,positive,50,1-Oct-15,"Simple, small menu. 3 kinds of dosas, idlis, and some rice dishes. Drinks menu is even smaller.
The shop is famous for its idlis, although the rest of the menu is excellent as well.
Pure vegetarian."
French,Poulet,Amazing food,positive,50,6-Aug-14,This place is incredible! the food and deserts are delicious... If you go to Singapore you have to try the roasted chicken with mushroom and the tiramisu! Love it!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top seafood,positive,40,06/17/17,"This place is crazily busy which must mean it is doing something right. The seafood is as fresh as possible. Great variety available at different prices which can reach stratospheric levels if you are not careful. The house special of pepper and salt prawns was absolutely delicious with plump juicy prawns that burst in the mouth. We shared a number of different dishes as one does in Asian restaurants and all were tasty. The service was pretty chaotic and their habit of bringing out dishes one at a time is most disconcerting for group sharing. Curiously they supply tiny paper serviettes which are practically useless, which struck me as bizarre in a.place of quality food. Nevertheless the place was packed on Friday night."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good decor but expensive,negative,30,10-Jan-14,Found the place to be neat and clean. Decor is quite nice. And good location in Little India. Also good variety of chaat options if u are in the mood for something different from the usual meals or heavy snacks. but price wise it is on the expensive side. So if u are on a tight budget better check the menu before settling in.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One stop for all,positive,40,2-Dec-14,"Especially for those who are in Singapore on an extremely tight schedule, Newton has always been the place to grab most of the local cuisines at one go. It can be overwhelming at times but I would recommend my friends to venture a little, look at what people order and order the same if it attracts you. Not overly pricey, one can easily be filled up with less than SGD$10 going for one dish items like Ba Chor Mee Pok, Chicken rice, Fried Hokkien mee. But go big a little and try the Sting Ray, my favourite (I always ask for chilli on the side)."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",A Place for Curry,positive,40,12-Oct-14,"This is a review of the restaurant's outlet at Suntec City Mall.

French,Paul,yummy pastries sandwiches and everything else,positive,50,22-Jan-17,"for orchard road this place falls somewhere between the cheap eat/moderately priced and is high on quality. pastries a must and its one of the few places you can buy proper bread in Singapore, lacks in ambience as well, its in a shopping mall."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore","Very enjoyable meal, reasonably priced.",positive,40,27-May-12,"Had a very enjoyable meal at the Suntec City Mall location. Saturday evening and the restaurant was busy, nevertheless the service was good, the food was very good, spice level enjoyable and all dishes were well prepared and nicely presented. Our only regret is that...More"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Traditional Dim sum restaurant. Worth a visit,positive,40,1/3/2015,When in Chinatown this is a great option for Dim Sum. Whilst it is in the heart of Chinatown it is a little hard to find the first time as its on the first floor and the entrance is not particularly well signposted. We thoroughly enjoyed Yum Cha and visited it several times when in Singapore. Staff are friendly and the food was delicious. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety and cheap,positive,40,8-Aug-15,"The place crowded but fun, because you served with varieties of food, but the famous food here will be singapor carrot cakr and oyster cake. A must try place when you visit singapore"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best north indian food in Singapore,positive,50,26-Mar-16,"I have been to Kailash Parbat on multiple occasions, and its quality has always been consistently good. The place is a hit among the indian community and I have hardly seen any empty seats.The menu has lots of options. They have indian chaat, panipuri and chhole bhature all quite good, and which you wont find in many places. The yellow and black daals served here are extremely good! Paneer dishes are excellent as well.The service is efficient and the seating arrangement has space for both small or big groups. Prices are mid-range and put to shame any indian eatery outside Little India. This is one of the best 'bang for the buck' indian restaurants in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food,positive,40,07/22/16,Was there for a business dinner and we started with deep fried prawn which is well seasoned. Next was cili and black pepper crab. The crab was big and I had the privilege of eating the claws. Personally for me black pepper crab taste better despite its more spicy. Steam fish with cili is okay and would prefer just plain steam. The scallop was soft and tender. The steam clam was cooked perfectly. The only let down was the fried rice which has not much taste. That was the only dish that was left nearly untouched. Overall it was a nice seafood experience and would recommend those who loves fresh seafood
French,Paul,"Bad service, overpriced, poor preparation of food",negative,10,28-Dec-16,"Bad service, unattentive, and poor food. Slightly better than MacDonald

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Could be summed up in a word ""YUMMY!""",positive,40,6/12/2016,"The name LONG BEACH has been a Singapore icon since it began in all humility on a sandy beach by the lapping tide in Bedok, long long ago circa 1970's. The original LONG BEACH was run by a couple who served up the most delicious chilli crab EVER! Today there are several outlets and this one in Dempsey is but one. It was my son's birthday and his dear wife organised (and paid for) our family dinner there. We got a private room, not a mean feat, (the lady has clout!)The food was delicious and a good meal was had by all. They have some children play equipment downstairs, should there be a need to entertain the little ones.Uber may be a good idea for carpark spaces are filled up fast."
French,Angelina_MBS,The menu has changed. But not for the better.,negative,30,17-Feb-17,The menu has changed. Main courses have been reduced to five. The steak has also been changed and the price has increased from $36 to $45. The café was quiet on a Saturday night and so it was a good place to chat with friends.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great Food, Not-so-Fantastic Service",positive,40,23-Nov-17,"Headed over to Shin Minori (UE Square outlet) for the lunch buffet on last Sunday afternoon, because of the pleasant experience sometime in June.Took a little while before we were shown to our seats, but completely understandable due to the staff busy serving the many tables. However, when indicating to the supervisor/manager about a promotion code that we would like to utilise for the lunch buffet, he seemed rather disgruntled, where instructions for us to redeem the code sounded rather blunt. We felt the tone was rather uncalled for, as discount or not, we are still paying patrons. Nonetheless, we brushed it off rather quickly, and waited for our orders to arrive.Food arrived and they were as great as the previous time we had visited. The raw fish tasted fresh, and the Dragonfly Sushi was one of our favorites such that we had ordered twice. The meat dishes were nothing to shout about, but were still good. We were a little disappointed, though that a version of the cheese croquet (previously available) was not there anymore. The staff attending to us did not quite understand what we were conveying too well, probably because she was new to the job.So 2.50pm came and the same manager/supervisor came round our table, shoving the bill to us, and the tone used in informing us of the closing time felt rather pushy. While we understand the place closes at 3pm, we felt that a different tone used would have made the experience more pleasant, instead of making customers feel like they are being chased out.All in all, for the food we will definitely head back again, with hope that the next dining experience will be somewhat better."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Absolutely delicious,positive,50,17-Mar-14,"If quality top grade food is your priority, SHINJI is a MUST GO. I have called in on a Monday to book for lunch for Tues, however i was told that the restaurant was fully booked for lunch. Only to be surprised on Tuesday morning that seats were made available!Every single dish had the ""wow effect""! Ingredients were fresh and even the way the food were presented. The servers were exceptionally observant and attentive to our needs. Though its the second time I've been there, it continues to wow me and stays at the top of my MUST GO restaurants."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good Tasty Idlies,positive,40,20-Jul-13,I enjoyed the hot idlies with spicy sambar at this eating joint. A very good option if you are a pure vegetarian. Even tea was amazing.

French,Saveur,Affordable French cuisine,negative,30,9-Apr-16,"The price is attractive but the portion is very small. Good place for gathering with friends and try out French food. Tried the Saveur pasta, duck confit, pork belly, and lava cake with ice cream which costs as much as our pork belly main course :) The duck is so so, but I like that it was not salty like some other French restaurants. The pork belly reminded us as Japanese ramen dish, and tasted similar too! But disappointed at the presentation, in a bowl, with gravy, like ramen without the noodles :) "
French,Paul,More interested in dealing with deliveroo orders than serving customers,negative,20,4-Mar-17,"Orchard road branch. A disorganised service team, a manager who spent more time answering online orders than monitoring the status of the restaurant. We were not the only unhappy customers. The food is tasty but the service is worse than it was the last time I went four years ago. Use the take out counter, avoid dining in less reason for disappointment. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Homely (Indian) food at SG,positive,40,3-Apr-15,"I loved the food options - and with my love for Indian food this was a great place for the lunch choice.
You might have a wait for a while in the rush hours. However, its worth the wait."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,some yummy dim sum but not as good as Taiwan,negative,30,11/2/2013,"I was disappointed, to be fair, that the promised trolley service was not available on the Friday we visited: weekends only! The long biao xai was good enough and the mixed seafood in green casing really delicious, but some of dumplings were a bit sticky and hard to extract from the steamer. Disappointed not to have any green vegetables at all so the meal is all a bit stodgy. Service good and friendly and the tea was tasty. Having feasted at the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei, it's a hard act to follow!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Surprisingly good sashimi,negative,30,15-Jun-17,Good sashimi quality for the price but that's it. Everything else was average. So just order the sashimi if that's your thing.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A lot of fun!!!,positive,40,10-Apr-17,"Great vibe and good food, this is worth the trip even if it was just for the experience. Don't worry about night time travel, it is safe and family friendly. Try everything if you like we had 3 different dishes from 3 different vendors and all were tasty and quickly delivered."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Buffet dinner at Riverwalk Tandoor,positive,40,2-May-12,I have been to this restaurant thrice and I keep visiting because the buffet spread is really good value for money(never tried the ala carte).The fish tikka or chilly fish or whatever fish starters they have are one of the best that I have had...More
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",go there if you are craving Indian food,negative,30,24-Oct-14,"Went to Kailash Parbat once after moving to Singapore. The food was just about average. Not as good as what you get at Kailash Parbat in India. However the food here is really costly. The staff is helpful but there is definitely hygiene issue, place can do with some cleaning and same goes for cutlery. Expensive compared to other Indian restaurants in the area."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really good food,positive,50,15-Jan-15,"Try the soft chilli crab! Amazing. Loved the food. Upon arrival can be a bit annoying with vendors trying to push their menu's onto them. Just ignore them and quickly find a suitable stall to buy from and once you have ordered, everyone ignores you pretty quickly. It's lovely to sit outside at night. Try the juice place and the natural cane sugar drink, delicious!"
French,Paul,Newly opened Paul at Paragon,negative,20,7-Sep-15,"We ordered waffle, crepe, hot chocolate and flat white.Waffle: hard and cold, definitely not freshly made, ice cream taste weird;Crepe: hard and cold, not freshly made, lousy;Hot chocolate: not hot, super diluted, tasteless;Flat white: diluted, not enough milk or not fresh milk. Worse than Starbucks.Total cost: $43P.s. We asked for warm water, waitress even came back to confirm again and eventually we got 2 cups of ICE water.We will never come back again. "
French,Saveur,Duck confit was still as good as before,positive,40,6-Feb-18,"Been some years since I dined at Saveur. Went back specifically for the duck confit. It's of the right texture & crispness, yet not oily to taste. Certainly a place to visit for wallet-friendly quality duck confit."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper crab,negative,30,03/28/16,"Good tofu, great pepper crab, but make sure they take the crab meat out of the shell because they will do a better cleaner job than you can! Get a table in front of the crab tanks for atmosphere. The rooms on the far side are lifeless and AC is too cold. Parking is easy outside. Im not sure the set menu is good value, we felt quite hussled into ordering it. Service is excellent."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow what a winner,positive,40,26-Jul-16,This was not the cheapest hawker centre we encountered but it was a winner. All the dishes we tried were great. We will be back!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great sushi for a great price in expense Singapore ,positive,40,18-May-16,"Singapore has some amazing sushi places but they can be at amazing prices...Very expensive! This place has a nice atmosphere and good quality sushi. It won't be the best you ever had but certainly stands on its own. It is ""buffet"" style so you pay one price and order all you can eat. You order from tablets at the table. Super easy and efficient. I would recommend a reservation only because they put you near the kitchen on purpose without one...and we were the only ones in the restaurant!Good value and quality for the price. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome Black Pepper Crab,positive,50,1-Nov-16,Lovely outdoor dining atmosphere With ample parking space. We had Black Pepper crab with seafood Fried Rice and we loved every bit of it. I tried the sugar cane juice and ended up having 2 glasses.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food BUT VERY Poor service ,negative,20,07/30/18,"Went for lunch and the food was good. We also requested to see their private room for an upcoming dinner event for 25 pax. When asked for the dinner menu, the senior staff actually told me to see the menu from the website. Are they going paperless?! No! When I request again from another waiter, he brought it to me within split seconds. Next, it was lunch peak hours when we were there, the waitress were busy folding the table cloth and not paying attention to us diners. When we requested to place order for our food, the waitress reacted as if I am interrupting her work of ""folding table cloth"". Thirdly, for a restaurant of this standard, we have to refill our own Chinese tea. Probably they are really short handed..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,negative,10,1-Feb-13,"Most of the food here is over-rated, though I find the Muslim food pretty good. If you are in thsi area, why not try the Adam Rd Food Centre, which has better choice of local food but with better prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Never again,negative,10,2-May-12,Lots of touts with overpriced items. Good for tourists though but not for the natives since quality of food is just passable. Nothing great.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not Impressed,negative,20,10/24/14,"We dined here recently as part of a group tour of China Town , the food was served promptly, but sadly very bland tasting , in fairness it was set menu and not really to my normal choice ."

Dosa, Masala Dosa, Puri, everything is good !
Do not hesitate if you enjoy south indian food !"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointment ,positive,40,6-Nov-16,"Went to Waku Ghin with high expectations. With the dinner menu priced at $450++ and wines being heavily marked up, you are going to spend at least $1.5K for a couple, so naturally you would expect a wow. But it was not the case, as the majority of the food courses were decent but not outstanding. Service was superb and almost impeccable, except that the upselling efforts by the staff were on the heavy side. Ambiance is pleasant. Decor is first class. Wine list is excellent. Conclusion. Waku Ghin has failed to impress us: indeed it is a decent establishment, but there is a number of restaurants in Singapore offering even better food while being much more affordable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",LOVE IT,positive,50,2-Dec-17,"this is my go to restaurant for jap buffet, esp with its 1 for 1 deal. cheap but quality food and a wide variety of choices !"
French,L_Angelus,Forgettable experience,negative,20,8-Feb-14,"I was at the restaurant with a friend for dinner. Food is decent. Forget about service. My expectations from such a high price setting restaurant comes with some service expectations. I was reasonably disappointed. My dining experience is served by a rude staff and other more decent service team. It dampens my dining experience totally. They have an uncanny ability to make one feel that it is through the sheer grace of the service team, one gets to have a french dining cuisine. Since I beg to differ, I will never come back again."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best food ever,positive,50,5-Mar-14,"Sandwiches and bhatura are awesome and out of the world..
Very tasty...and not expensive according to the ambience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese High Tea,positive,50,01/25/15,"If you are looking for a dim sum type experience and you look at the time and think "" missed it"", do not despair. Yum Cha has their version of a high tea dim sum (no carts, just a menu with pics) from 3-6pm, but you must arrive by 5 or they will tell you its last order before you order anything! All the food is delicious, shrimp and mango rolls, paper chicken wings, custard buns, you name it and it is made to perfection.As is the case in many Chinatown eateries , the service can be gruff and dismissive but for me that's all part of the charm.You will find this place upstairs, try to get a table by the window and watch the Chinatown chaos go on below you while you enjoy perfectly cooked food and deliciously hot Jasmine tea."
French,Paul,"Really Bad Service (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",negative,10,3-Feb-14,"Couldn't find where to write specifically for the Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall. For those who do not know, Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall is the latest branch. The Paul Bakery at Westgate mall is yet another cafe who has such bad service until I simply cannot tolerate. As someone who has written and edited many customer service guidebooks as well as an easy-going person in general, never in my life did I expect to be CHASED out of a cafe/restaurant as soon as I tried to sit down. Let me explain what happened. My friend and I decided to have our lunch at this Paul Bakery today. We saw the queue sign outside the high class bakery and we were wondering if we should even queue since there isn't ANYONE queuing. We waited for a while before deciding to just walk in since no one came to attend to us and also because we saw quite a good number of empty seats. So we very happily walk in thinking what a nice place it is, with all the beautiful French decor. Note that no one even bothered attending to us. So we thought it's pretty straightforward that we can just choose our seats FREELY (which person wouldn't do that you tell me? It doesn't matter that no one bothered to attend to us since they probably are busy. Although i don't see how busy the staff were) . So we chose an empty table for 4 and I sat down. Then this waitress came up to us and said loudly, ""miss, that table is for four persons, you cannot sit there. You must sit at the 2 person table."" I immediately thought to myself, ""You never even attend to me and ask me how many pax do we actually have and you tell me I cannot sit so loudly. The 4 pax table is made up of 2 small tables and can definitely be SEPARATED if NEEDED."" So I said, the extra table can be separated if needed. Now, there were only 2 other 2-pax tables in the whole cafe. One at the entrance but the table was damn small (okay, we wanted to order more food. So they expect us to sit at a freaking small table just because there were only 2 of us? Honestly, if we are going to order a lot of food, we should just choose a bigger table which can contain all our food items isn't it? This is really common sense. If I am just ordering a COFFEE, fine, I squeeze. I think I AM FAIR in this aspect). And so, I spotted a nice looking spot which has a better table at one of the corners and requested for it but the table was not cleaned yet as the previous patrons just left. Guess what, the honorable waitress actually told me ""that table cannot sit because we need to clear the table first. You have to GO OUTSIDE and QUEUE."" I asked my friend if I heard wrongly or did that waitress really ask me to get up from my seat and go out of the door and queue? Yes, I have to open the freaking big door and go stand outside. Everyone in the cafe suddenly just turned and looked at us. Please note that we still did not make any unreasonable request or became unreasonable. The only thought was unbelief with the sucky attitude. They could have first come up to us and ask us how many pax do we have, is it only 2 persons, if so, is it possible that we choose a 2 pax table instead so they could offer the table to customers who are in 4s if they happen to come in. As a high class cafe, they should expect that patrons may walk in anytime to reserve a table while waiting for other friends. You cannot deny this is a common culture in Singapore and probably anywhere else in the world. They could have ask us to take a seat first while they clear the table since there really isn't a queue. We have already obliged by relocating to a 2 pax table. So we were asked to GO OUTSIDE and stand. Not wanting to make a fuss, we simply went out to stand under the scrutiny of the whole cafe. I must say that was a ""very nice"" send-off by so many people. Meanwhile, there was a Caucasian lady who stepped into the restaurant at the same time. She was also not allowed to sit. I don't know what was the reason but she was obviously astonished with the attitude as she walked out and the three of us actually look at the cafe with a ""what is wrong"" glance and we decided to walk away at the same time. We actually met the same Caucasian lady at the next cafe. My point is, I am pissed not because I can't have lunch there. I am just damn pissed that I am getting such a bad attitude and service when I actually obliged. I don't mind obliging to your request to queue OUTSIDE if you have told me politely that you would like us to queue outside while you get the table ready and that you will come get me once the table is ready. At least, you can definitely just allow me to SIT at the empty tables or hand me the menus first. But I mind it freaking A LOT when you tell me to go outside and stand and that I can't sit at any empty table. You are a high class French cafe with very good branding. But you have very bad (probably non exist) f & b service management. Instead of keeping your customers and making them feel welcomed, you actually turn away not one but 3 customers who are willing to eat at your cafe!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi,positive,40,22-Nov-16,"Despite the crowd on a Sunday evening, the experience was good. The food was on time and in relative good qnatity. Outstanding meal and fresh sashimi to top it. The other thing I like is the ordering system...just order via the iPad... orders don't get lost and you get what you ordered - unlike the other Japanese restaurants where some of the order disappears..."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A variety of choices,positive,40,7-Dec-15,"Ideally located opposite Newton MRT, this food centre offers an array of choices - mostly Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Indian & Thai cuisine."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,negative,30,19-Feb-16,"Came here for lunch this week to try the lunch buffet. There's a reasonable selection of sashimi, sushi and typical Japanese dishes. Food quality was ok without being exceptional. Service was a bit haphazard and we had a few minor glitches with the Samsung tablets. Used the Entertainer app to get a 1:1 deal and at that price per person this represents reasonable value. Not sure I'd visit again at full price."
French,Poulet,Quiet Ambience amidst a crowded mall ,positive,50,16-Jan-15,"Signature full chicken with mushroom cream sauce was simply delicious. Goes perfectly with their chestnut rice. Tiramisu dessert was a nice end to our lunch.
Would definitely return again."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disappointing Chaat!!,negative,10,14-Apr-16,"I went to Kailash Parbat to celebrate my birthday yesterday with some chaat (as I love paani puri a lot). I ordered for one plate paani puri and one plate dahi puri. I was so disappointed with both these dishes. The pooris used were very hard and oily. It actually bruised my mouth. The sweet and spicy water of pani puri were nice. The dahi puri was horrible. The puri was again oily and hard, the sev used as topping was stale and smelly. The tea they served was cold. The ambiance was nice though but the chaat was a complete NO! NO!We went there with high expectations and were left disappointed."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Singapore is a must after Tets Sydney restaurant,positive,50,18-May-12,"I have experienced Tet's restaurant back in the hay days when he was on the other side of the bridge in a very small funky restaurant and he was a master of degerstation menu back then. When he moved over the bridge to Sydney CBD you knew that Tetsuya was becoming famous for his dining experience. So with our trip to Singapore last year we quickly booked a spot at Waku Ghin as it is a massive wait. So book well ahead. WOW it was the most incredible experience and meal ever. 10 courses and a take home box of truffles. I do not eat meat, so I was looked after well and my partner so did enjoy his 2 meat dishes and commented best ever meat dishes. The wine list is so extensive and the cost of alcohol is not cheep at all in Singapore and it was a night we were happy just to eat and enjoy the journey. It is not a cheap night out, so do take the cheque book as much more than the Sydney restaurant. But if you are a fan of Tet's then it is a must do at Singapore. You are so well looked after and it is so personal, that no one can beat what Waku Ghin does, well not found any better as yet. The ambience is an experience also."

French,Saveur,"Great service, staff and food",positive,50,29-Jun-18,"Had the 3 course dinner on 29 June, and I wasn't super excited about the dessert for the set menu. That's when I noticed they serve creme brulee for 3 course lunch. So I enquired if I could change my dessert to creme brulee. The very nice and polite waiter went through the trouble of checking with the chef, instead of outrightly rejecting my request. I was pleasantly delighted that they changed the dessert for me. Although it may not seem much to some people, it's usually these little gestures that make the difference, and make people remember you. This definitely made my day, ending it on a sweet note. So, thanks for that Saveur @ Cathay!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi Buffet,positive,40,22-Oct-16,"Friendly staff, fresh sashimi...Reasonable prices too...Booking required on weekend. Bean Sprouts and teppanyaki meat are tasty."
