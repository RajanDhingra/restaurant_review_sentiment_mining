Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",OMG what a sushi experience ??,1,50,3-Oct-18,Had a quick impromptu business lunch and strolled in just after 1pm without a reservation. The service and reception was impeccable. The Chef ? what can I say. The very best I have come across in Singapore. Engaging the client in a meal with a running commentary and making the entire but brief 12 piece sushi lunch set all too brief but what a sushi ride . A little pricey but what an experience 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi,1,50,3-Oct-18,"I have been to most Japanese restaurants in Singapore and i've been to Shinji several times, it is simply D best in my opinion. the service is impeccable, the ingredient used are of good quality and its sushi taste great. Although its on the higher end of the price scale, its worth at least one visit especially for special occasions."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistent ,1,50,21-Sep-18,"You can never go wrong here. Always fresh, always friendly and excellent service. Michelin rated Chef."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth the money,1,50,19-Sep-18,I had lunch with my colleague at the restaurant.We both ordered Chef Omakaze(don’t remember exactly but it was one of thier Omakaze).Their quality level of the foods are excellent and matter of fact it was too much food for me!We had some beers and highballs. Eventually we paid slightly over 1k Singapore dollar as total.They are expensive but worth the money.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but excellent vaule for lunch,1,50,30-Aug-18,"Heard so much about this restaurant. Was invited there for lunch. It’s like walking into Japan. The decor was so authentic, so Japanese.Seated at the counter top which seats only 8 diners. So much to eat and the food was excellent. I was overblown by the freshness and the use of the chef’s sauce painted on the sashimi and sushi. The taste was mild and not over powering. The best dish was the humble tamago with tiny shrimps. The taste was so unique and great.Definitely recommended but mind the pocket."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi!,1,50,29-Aug-18,"I went there for my birthday treat with my hubby.Please make reservation and get the counter seats!The chef will prepare every single sushi and serve directly to you piece by piece. He will only make the second piece once you ate the first piece.All very fresh ingredients, melt in the mouth.. you can opt for less rice too.They add surprise element by serving the birthday cake / dessert by turning off the light, singing the song, the chefs all wear masks (Japanese characters.one of them was Pikachu). Birthday hat and balloon... so cool!!Great place to celebrate special occasion and you can arrange surprise too!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Yet again a top notch sushi experience,1,50,16-Aug-18,The best sushi restaurant in Singapore for me. Great to interact with the chefs and always special treat to be at head chef Oshino-san’s counter.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase birthday celebration,1,40,9-Aug-18,"Celebrated my Fiance's birthday with Omakase Yume lunch sets at Carlton Hotel. It was a memorable gastronomical experience and we enjoyed every item prepared. Recommended to sit at the counter seats for omakase as it was interesting to watch how the Chef prepares each item. Ingredients were fresh and the layers of flavour were overwhelming! Every dish is a surprise. Service staffs are friendly and cheerful, and they prepared a small surprise for the birthday celebration. Total bill amount to $588 for 2 pax so I wouldn't say it is valued for money."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakasgasm,1,50,8-Aug-18,"Highlight of my week is the Chefs Special. It’s literally flown from Tsukiji to your plate. It warms my heart when these badass n*ggas put gold leaf on my sushi.
Love x"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Don’t be stingy st Shinjii ,1,40,31-Jul-18,"First time back since they moved from a Raffles to Carlton hotel; had the Chef’s Omakase. Of course, it’s extremely good, especially the cooked dishes. Somehow, I prefer the sushi at Ashino, and I find the uni rice bowl at Ki-sho more satisfying. But, at this level, differences are minimal and preferences are more a personal matter."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Next Level Omakase ,1,50,29-Jul-18,"I was lucky enough to be entertained by a client who advised we would be doing Shinjuku at the Carlton Hotel. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and then directed to a smaller room. We then sat and did the Omakase menu. Our Japanese chef nailed all the courses, with everything perfect from the delicate fish to the warmth of the rice. He also recommended some off menu Sake which is from his home town. Was delicious. Looking forward to my next visit. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great place Great experience,1,50,21-Jul-18,"We loved everything about the place, right from the entrance, the inner ambience, the highly hospitable staff, the delicious and mouth watering preparations.
Worth a revisit soon."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi done right,1,50,13-Jul-18,"Located in the Carlton hotel. This place was very quiet despite hotel being busy. Really great quality produce, especially the tuna. I would recommend."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicious,1,50,9-Jul-18,"Phenomenal sushi prepared by well trained professionals in a wonderful setting. One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever visited.
Not cheap but a great place to go for a treat.
Will definitely visit again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Hana lunch set,1,50,8-Jul-18,Shinji isn’t cheap at all but I decided I just had to try it. The best way to do this without getting too badly gouged is through the Hana lunch set: 9 pieces of sushi for $75++. Service and food quality are excellent. I was able to walk in on a weekday without a reservation. I would love to try the more expensive options but will save that for a special occasion. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Fresh, delicious, omakase lunch from friendly 1 Star Michelin Shinji (Carlton Hotel, Singapore)",1,50,19-Jun-18,"Boss brought two of us here as a surprise, during lunch. This is my second visit; previously, the chefs were at Shinji, Raffles Hotel.The size of the restaurant was just right and it was neither noisy nor quiet. Feel free to talk. Our chef paid attention to our conversations and chatted with us on some matters. We had an expensive omakase set - SGD 300 - this set included a plate with four types of uni, all of which were sweet. Chef informed us the order in which they should be consumed. The seafood was terrific in general. I enjoyed watching my chef press and shape the rice with seafood. I took numerous shots with my mobile and he was ok with that; he even smiled and mock-posed for me once !The dish with the monkfish liver was the best I had - lucky me, my boss gave me her portion. The monkfish came in two generous portions, and were served with a big slice of octopus, daikon with sea eel (I'm guessing from the pics because I can't remember), prawns or lobster and (this is what I enjoy most in Japanese fine dining) decorated with maple leaves and hydrangea.The last dish - fruits - included a generous (and expensive) sweet slice of honey dew and mango (also very expensive and very sweet).Altogether, a gorgeous lunch - great food, friendly chefs. Feel free to let them know you dislike certain tastes or smells - both my colleagues had them exclude wasabi and one of them asked them to hold back spring onions.If you have spare change, drop by Carlton Hotel Singapore for Shinji and enjoy the lovely Chihuly glass sculpture at hotel lobby."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Distinctive Japanese cuisine,1,50,19-Jun-18,"Shinji by Kanesaka. Located at Lobby floor, Carlton Hotel, 76 Bras Basah Road, Singapore.The gateway of a wonderful marriage of distinctive Japanese cuisine serving a tantalising collection of dishes that will cater to every palate. Personal chef of the day will personally attend to about 8 diners, preparing busy at work master of sushi he expertly sliced out the fish, put on the sushi rice and finally, potter on the delicate seasonings, creating a very unique flavours. All the sushi I had tasted are very fresh and do not have even a hint of fishy smell, yet retaining the sweet, unique flavour of each own fish. The service is absolutely excellent, warm, friendly and genuine. One of the best services I had encountered. The place is unsophisticated, yet elegant, full of the Zen inspiration, filling one with tranquillity. I love this place I'll definitely be back!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A must for Sushi lover,1,50,20-May-18,"One of the finest Omakase in Singapore my wife said that. Located in the ground floor, same as lobby of the Carlton Hotel, it provides both private room as well as share table over the counter where the Chef prepare each and every bite of your sushi & Sashimi. My wife ordered a small set, 15 pieces, Omakase cost $ (Singaporian) 220 cuz she's a small lady. The Chef was very kind to cutdown the size of rice in each sahimi underneath the superb and fresh various kind of fish such as Uni, Akami,O Toro, Ama-E bi, Shima-Aji, and others which we did not know the exact Japanese name. My wife told Chef that she loves white-meat-fish and he tried to give her more so. The meal was superb and worth the price. Strongly recommended if you are sushi lover. Will definitely come back !"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh sushi and very nice service!!!,1,50,20-May-18,I came here with my friend and i love this place because of food and service. Everything here was superb. I will come back with my family next time.Thanks you everything. Highly recommend if you need sushi in Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Japanese in Singapore,1,50,18-May-18,"On a recent visit through Singapore and a birthday treat for a local, I and a friend dined at Shinji by Kanesaka at the Carlton Hotel.The atmosphere was lively yet relaxing.The restaurant had separate rooms for group.We shared a section with 4 other couples.We chose the mixed sashimi and sushi menu, fixed price around $300 per head plus a small Sake recommended by the host.The food was sublime.It was prepared for us by the master's chef in front of us.Every dish was an explosion of flavour, singing of the sea.The sea urchin roe was unctuous and luscious, washed down with the light and fragrant Sake.A superb night and fit for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sashimi and sushi nigri ever,1,50,12-May-18,"Amazing experience. I have never had such a great japanese dinner. To celebrate this excellent meal, I have a photo of me as a Sumo fighter and my wife as a fish but I will spare you that. Many thanks to the great team at Shinji by Kaneska"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Sushi lover must try,1,50,28-Apr-18,"We came here because it's located inside St Regis where we stayed. Our friends already told us this is one of the best Japenese restaurants in Singapore. We sat at the sushi counter facing our chef. We then ordered one Omakase & one sushi lunch with a bottle of sake recommended by the chef. Everything was so perfect with delicious food. The sashimi & sushi were all very fresh. I love the dessert which was a rice cracker shell with green tea ice cream, Very comfortable atmosphere & the guests including us just focused on the food well prepared by our chefs. It's pricey but we got what we paid for: quality food, excellent chef, perfect service and nice/quiet ambience. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Extremely good, but atmosphere and wooden chopsticks",1,40,31-Mar-18,"No complaints about the food,perfect! Missing is though a bit of atmosphere it’s just empty rooms with chairs doesn’t help creating a good conversation. For a Michelin star restaurant having wooden chopsticks...."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,1,50,26-Mar-18,"Extremely happy to have dined here. The staff were superb, very attentive and helpful. The chef was just a delight. Happy to chat while he worked. And what a master he was - it is so incredible to watch a true craftsman.But the food - well you will not find fresher or better tasting anywhere. If you are a Japanese food lover then this one is for you. Yes it is expensive, don't think you will get much change out of $1,200 - but you really must try it at least once in your life."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wow wow wow,1,50,20-Mar-18," Not sure where to start. We had an amazing experience at Shinji by Kanesaka. The food is absolutely amazing, the private rooms with your own chef makes this an culinary feast. The sushi and sashimi is made to perfection. A perfect place to any special occasion."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Honeymoon sushi,1,50,25-Feb-18,"When investigating restaurants for the start of our Honeymoon in Singapore, one stood out from the crowd - Shinji at The Carlton hotel, why.......The promise of an intimate and authentic sushi experience - we were not disappointed!We left the dish decision to our sushi master chef Oshino and boy did he deliver, from the three different ages and types of tuna to the two different types sea urchin, every dish was incredible to look at let alone taste.Watching the master himself, chef Oshino, was a true honour, the preparation of every dish was a joy to watch, so meticulous and precise.Our visit totally changed our opinion on sake, the choice was overwhelming but the waiting staff helped us with the perfect choice.We left feeling truly spoiled and that we had experienced a truly magical culinary experience.Some people say that Shinji is too expensive, I say you get what you pay for and we got culinary excellence and one hell of an evening.We will be back - we just do not know when."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A inviting and exquisite experience,1,50,23-Feb-18,"After trying Kanesaka in Tokyo, I was stoked to find out there was one in Singapore, and offering cheaper options. The chef recommended we take the $125 course if we liked uni (originally we came for the $75), and we were not disappointed! The chef we had was jovial and friendly, and it's apparent the chef has loyal regulars by the way they interact, which is good to see! We we in a smaller room, but it didn't detract from the experience. I would definitely take others there the next time! Quality of the food almost as good as the Tokyo Palace Hotel branch!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lunch date ,1,50,22-Jan-18,"As always, my fav is Japanese food and my hubby took me to Shinji@raffles hotel. We went for the full set meal. Their serving was very generous and lots of variety. Their service was great and their chef even wore some funny mask to entertain the customers. Finds their service personal. Excellent food and excellent service "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Omakase Japanese Cuisine,1,50,7-Jan-18,"Excellent omakase Japanese Cuisine served by team of artisan chef.. rest assured that you will be served the freshest ingredients and beautifully presented.. Delight your palate and will definitely keep you busy taking pictures.. a great place for Japanese Cuisine lover, and hosting your guests.  Michelin ??"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore,1,50,31-Dec-17,"Amazing selection of nigiri sushi. Excellent cuts of fish that are perfectly seasoned, paired with warm, moist and vinegar flavoured rice! The tamago here is sweet, soft and outstanding too! Service is friendly with lots of attention to detail. Each visit is a trip to sushi heaven!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Yummy Japanese ,1,40,18-Dec-17,"A busy Japanese restaurant that looks like a favorite among locals. The sushi/sashimi is very fresh. For dessert, I loved their green tea ice cream."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fabulous sashimi/ sushi (at a price),1,40,28-Nov-17,A great experience if you are a fan of sashimi/ sushi (including cuttlefish sperm & monk fish liver!). Undeniably fabulous sashimi and sushi; also undeniably expensive. We went on a Monday evening when there were not many diners and the sushi bar was lacking in atmosphere. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi restaurant ,1,50,25-Nov-17,"Great experiences
Fresh
Innovative
Best sushi
Excellent service
It was in Raffles hotel in the before and removed here in Apr 2017.
The table is made from special wood - 220 years old. It is of one piece wood."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Totally Recommend it! ,1,50,9-Nov-17,Fish is super fresh and delicious!The staff is really nice and accesible. They will not give you what you ask them not to and they will substitute your pieces with something else instead of just not giving anything to you like other omakase places. The sake was one of the best I've ever had! Totally recommend this place! 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excelent,1,50,7-Nov-17,Excelent but very expensive. Intimate. Best for special ocasions. Food great quality. Sake perfect. Reservation required for saturday evening.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing sushi,1,50,18-Oct-17,"Traveling regularly to Japan, it has always been difficult to find the same taste in Singapore.But this time, I have found it!What a fantastic omakase prepared by the whole team is sushi masters.It was like a short trip to Japan during a dinner. THE sushi place in Singapore"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi of my well traveled life,1,50,7-Oct-17,"Nothing can compare to this experience. About 10 seats and at least 4 chefs working in front of you creating traditional exotic Japanese artful, precise, wonderful food. Each mouthful amazing. Each serving on beautiful special plates, every creation made with a ballet-like movement between chef and fish."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE sushi bar,1,50,22-Sep-17,"One problem there is with this place - it annuls all the sushi you've eaten before. Unless you've been to a similar establishment in Japan or Hong Kong (let's face it, the chances are low), Shinji is going to be your maiden genuine sushi experience. We felt literally like savages being civilized here. You eat nigiri sushi several seconds after they were prepared.You don't handle soy sauce and wasabi - it's for the chef to decide the sauces in what you're eatingWe had a set consisting of a starter, 14 nigiri sushi, miso soup with sakura shrimp and a dessert. And that were definitely the best ones we ever had. Different kinds of tuna, needle fish, sea urchin roe, shrimp and all. The place is a real eye opener on what a proper sushi is."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Don't take the kids!...,1,50,6-Sep-17,"The decor here is Tokyo authentic and the fish direct from the Tokyo fish market (literally). As you could expect the Sushi is unbelievable!!However, with a $200, $300 or $500 price per head, it's not a cheap nite out.The only goods news is that the wine is quite affordable (by comparison).Loved it tho. And I'm going back for the $500 meal (but won't take the kids)."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing jap sashimi/sushi,1,50,4-Sep-17,"Had the Omakase and the 9piece set for both of us.
Probably the best tuna sashimi i have eaten (i dare say even better than the ones we tried in Osaka at kurumon ichiba market!)
Ended with nice birthday surprise from the chefs!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wonderful experience ,1,50,30-Jul-17,Had an Omakase lunch at Shinji. We were time constrained so we requested the sashimi and sushi. The sashimi and sushi were impeccable. Wonderfully fresh and melted in the mouth. The pickled ginger was also excellent - most unusual texture and flavour. Service was discreet and excellent. An expensive experience but worth it. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicacy ,1,50,26-Jul-17,For the first time of my life I finished all the gingers and probably the most I have ever had! Friendly waitress kindly answered my question about the finger wipe. The sushi is just amazing. Would be better if the chef presents them with more languages than Japanese. In the end I'm just not full...
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Heavenly Chutoro,1,50,20-Jul-17,Starts with sashimi and cooked stuff and ends with sushi. The chutoro (semi fatty tuna) is the best I ever tasted!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but....,1,40,17-Jul-17,"The fish are fresh, the uni rice with caviar is excellent. The service is ok( some younger waitress are a little unsure. Ambience is same as any sushi place.
Prices are higher than Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Tokyo Standard Japanese Sushi in Singapore,1,50,13-Jul-17,"It had moved to Carlton hotel some time ago & this was the first time we went there, & we had the OMAKASE for our dinner. It has a seating for 12 at the counter, & three more tables at the side & a private room; obviously u need to make an advance booking if you want to get a counter seat. This is the place to go in S'pore if you demand same high quality Sushi as you would get at those high end Sushi Restaurants in Japan, so be prepared to pay a hefty premium."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore,1,50,23-Jun-17,Very good sushi served at a counter or in small private rooms. Expensive but the quality of produce is telling. 1 michelin star is a fair rating and this is easily one of the top 3-5 sushi restaurants in Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Serious Sushi in a Traditional Setting,1,50,7-May-17,"Special night if you like Sushi as we do as we made our way through the tasting menu and then more. Beautifully prepared, served and accompanied with sake and wine."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The standard,1,50,7-May-17,"Despite many high end Japanese restaurants in Singapore, and the many hype and stars associated with them, I felt that Shinji is the one that still sets the standard of Edomae sushi. It is a pure culinary experience.My wife and I visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration and we chose the counter seats for better interaction with the chef and energy of the surrounding.We left our evening with the chef to take us through the wonderful Omakese journey he had prepared for us. It's difficult to explain in full the amazing favor of each ingredients and how they intertwined with each other. It's the skills and arts combined at work, and the respect that the chef had on the ingredients. This reminded us of the beautiful sushi experience in Tokyo and Otaru.We also ordered a bottle of chilled sake as recommended, it went very nicely with the dishes; we decided to order another serving and shared with the chef and staff as an appreciation.The ambiance was zen and minimalistic, soothing to the eye and body. At the counter in our evening we had mainly Japanese diners, giving the experience an authentic feel.It's a memorable evening and one that will remain in our mind for a long time."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Same good quality. More seats,1,50,10-Apr-17,"Oshino-san was in his element, whipping out seasonal highlights with his affable personality & adorable wife as chief waitress clad in a brand new kimono, apparently from material given by her mum. Food was as usual sublimely exquisite. More seating capacity also meant higher din when diners get excited in their conversations. Interesting place to people watch as well. From the corporate types to singularly focused Japanese connoisseur just content with the pleasure of eating fresh sashimi."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding Japanese food,1,50,7-Apr-17,"I love Japanese food so I decided to treat myself when I was working in Singapore (why not?). Shinji seems to offer two sittings for lunch and the restaurant is very intimate with seating around the bar so you watch the chefs work. Perfect.I arrived for my lunch to a warm greeting and a stool for my bag. I decided to have the 'chef's surprise' whereby the chef prepares a number of different dishes for you, including hot dishes, and a selection of sashimi and sushi. I can only describe the meal as exceptional. I loved watching my sushi being prepared for me individually, the quality was incredible. The other dishes were works of art on a plate and were just as outstanding as the other dishes.I started taking notes of what I was eating so I could tell my other half when I got home but stopped after the fourth dish and just savoured the whole experience.This was an expensive treat to myself but it was one that I will always remember. I fully intend to return next time I'm in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",UNI RICEEEEE,1,40,27-Feb-17,"Had the omakase for 2.
Every sushi/dish tasted great. Definitely worth the experience.
Ended the omakase with the best melt in your mouth uni rice ever!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Edomae Sushi in Singapore,1,50,6-Feb-17,"Best Sushi restaurant in Singapore, period.. Having tried a number of popular sushi restaurant (be it with michelin stars or not), this one takes the crown for Singapore best at this Raffles hotel branch. Get the sushi counter and make advance reservation. And go for lunch for cheaper menu option. You can't go wrong with any menuFood = 5 stars, service = 5 stars.. Price, definitely reflect the quality offered"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good Edomae sushi tasting menu albeit pricey,1,40,23-Jan-17,"Really good sushi restaurant and great service. We had the Edomae menu which had 15 sushi options with a hefty price tag of S$220. The sea urchin and chutoro were particularly excellent, but the horse mackerel could be better and the temperature of the rice was inconsistent. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Deserves even more stars,1,50,20-Jan-17,If I could give a sushi restaurant 10 stars this would be the place --innovative tasty and as much as you can eat in one meal. Best sushi I have had anywhere on the globe
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",outstanding,1,50,30-Dec-16,"There is not a better Japanese restaurant in Singapore, this place is incredible in terms of food quality, service at the counter watching the chef's prepare and in terms of a lunch time price (apparently it's double in the evening so go for lunch!).Excellent in terms of impressing a client or a girl the delivery of one item at a time really enables you to fully enjoy the experience while still having great conversation. They have it sorted. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Intimate and Superb!,1,50,24-Dec-16,"This discrete restaurant on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel is widely considered to serve the best sushi in Singapore and we were not disappointed! We enjoyed the $225 US omakase at a 10 person sushi bar in a private room in the back of the restaurant. It consisted of more than a dozen courses of some cooked, but mostly raw dishes and everyone was both a visual and a culinary delight. Excellent service and a thoughtful and fairly-priced sake list rounded out the experience. Expensive but a must stop for any serious sushi lover visiting Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE perfect japanese restaurant outside japan,1,50,10-Dec-16,"outstanding and authentic japanese food of the very highest quality! pricy yes, but its worth every penny!! seeing the chefs preparing your sashimi and sushi dishes is a delight, again, outstanding!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best sushi meal I have ever had outside Japan,1,50,25-Nov-16,We sat at the bar with chef preparing the meal in front of us. They onoy have 3 set price menues and not a la carte. We chose the middle menu ($300 per person) and were not disappointed.We decided to go to town on the budget and ordered a bottle of Champagne to drink with our meal.This was the best Sushi meal we have ever had outside Japan. Worth every penny.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top of the line sushi,1,50,23-Oct-16,"We were there to celebrate our 25 th wedding anniversary. In a small room with 8 seats, chef Ishizawa showed his talents in 2 hours. Everything in the restaurant except water was brought from Japan. Every bit we tasted was so fresh and tasty. Sea urchin from Hokkaido was spectacular, I had not tasted such a good sea urchin even in Japan. The sake menu was quite good. The chef is a very nice person full of humor :) The price is quite high but it is worth eating at least one time in a lifetime.."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",First class.,1,50,17-Oct-16,Located on second floor of the Raffles hotel. Fantastic sushi and sashimi. The cold sake was super.Reccomended.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Japanese but can be $$$$$,1,50,1-Oct-16,"Went for dinner with a group of 5 at the Shinji, Raffles hotel. We took the smaller rooms which can occupy up to 8 pax. Ideal for group and also cosy. Food was great and fresh sashimi. We took omekashi set dinner and cost a lot with 2 bottles of sake. It was recently crowned with 1 star Michelin and expect the food and service at the TOP notch. Expensive but worth a try ."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,1,50,30-Sep-16,"Absolute fantastic sushi, prepared and beautifully presented by knowledgeable, dedicated experts. Not cheap - but the quality justifies the price."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing 1 Michelin Star Sushi in Singapore,1,50,29-Sep-16,"Located on the second level of the Raffles Hotel, Shinji sushi offered me an amazing authentic Japanese gourmet experience. I was there with my fiancee for a casual lunch. We ordered Hana (flower) set-lunch. The 9 pieces meal was definitely enough to fill your stomach. The chef prepared the freshest ingredients in front of us and he’d proportioned the size of the sushi rice so that you’d have the best experience without feeling either hungry or bloated at the end of the meal. We were really impressed by the gold flakes mocha dessert at the end."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase-Wow,1,50,26-Sep-16,"One of the top 5 dining experiences I have had. A Michelin star should tell you what you need to know and this restaurant is as good as the the top Omakase restaurants in Ginza.Chef Ishizawa presents and endless flow of fresh Japanese delicacies over about a 2 hour period. I am not a huge sea urchin (Uni) fan but Chef presented several types from Hokkaido and I was amazed.The grilled tuna was also out of this world as Chef selects a heavily marbled cut and the fish is tender and juicy throughout.One caution: If you have to ask about pricing, this is not your restaurant."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive sushi. Bespoke service.,1,40,18-Sep-16,"I'll start off by saying that at 250 ++ (around $300) per pax, this was probably one of the most expensive lunch i've ever had in my life (without alcohol). Made a reservation for 2 person for a weekday lunch, and was promptly seated at the table by a Japanese lady. Service was really good and there was a personal chef to cater to the 8 customers that were seated at my table (including myself). Ordered the Omakase (a.k.a Yume) set. It started off with some sea urchins as appetizers followed by a series of maybe 7-8 sashimi. Each of the sashimi served was pretty fresh, but my partner and myself were both slightly dissapointed that they didn't serve use Chutoro (i.e. fatty tuna) for the price we paid. (perhaps we had too high an expectation). Desert was some cake, nothing too special though.Overall, Lunch was okay, it wasn't too filling. The chef was pretty cool, sharing information on the food that we were served and the origins of the seafood etc. Reminds me of the time when I was at Sushi Dai (Tsukiji market, Tokyo), where the Japanese chef was similarly very keen to share more about the Japanese culture. All in all, based on my experience observing what the other guests were having, I think that the 12 or 15 pieces of sushi is of better value than the Omakase (they are about $100 cheaper).Definitely do check out this place if you are looking at high-end Japanese cuisine in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you like sushi you must go to Shinji,1,50,14-Sep-16,"Located at the Raffles hotel, we went there not knowing what to expect, once we got there and saw a small restaurant we knew the experience was gonna be epic.If you come to Shinji you know you will get the best sushi in town..100% fresh!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding!,1,50,13-Sep-16,"My husband and I were celebrating a special occasion and decided on Shinji @ Raffles Hotel for lunch at the sushi counter on a Saturday in September and were not disappointed. We have previously dined at several Michelin star restaurants in Japan, and were keen to try Shinji. We ordered the 12 piece sushi course. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi and sashimi and thought it was first class. The fish melted in the mouth and the rice was served at room temperature. Although wasabi was available, we followed the chef's lead and didn't add any more to our plates. The 12 piece course was sufficient for us. Attentive service in filling our drinks when required (we had champagne). We brought our 11 month old daughter and the staff were courteous and friendly to her too. She didn't eat but enjoyed the experience and attention from the friendly wait staff. While not a fault of the restaurant, I was surprised to see and felt a bit disappointed for the chef and staff that a fellow diner (who was by himself) was dressed very casually in shorts and t-shirt and ate entire meal with head phones on and looking at his phone. All in all, a wonderful experience and would eat here again for a special occasion!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good sushi,1,50,11-Sep-16,"Last year I went to Hashida sushi, and this year to Shinji. I think both restaurants are equally good. At Shinji my husband and I ordered the Hana set and the Omakase special for lunch. Total bill was about $380+. Sushi is very good, though the pieces seem to be smaller than what I had in Tokyo. I remember that in Tokyo the pieces of fish are much larger than the rice underneath. Here in Shinji the fish and the rice are about the same size.Overall, it is a very good dining experience with excellent service. Though I don't think it is value for money if you compared with what you can get in Tokyo."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",First class!,1,50,31-Jul-16,"Dinner for 4 with Japanese guests in a private room. Set menu. Great variety, every course fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Even the cold sake was outstanding.
Excellent service throughout. My guests and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Very expensive, but worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply Amazing Experience,1,50,30-Jul-16,"With the recent Michelin star introduction in Singapore, this is the 1st restaurant with a Michelin star that i visited. I went to another Michelin star restaurant the next day and by comparison, food is so much fresher and delicious, ambiance is quiet yet cosy, and the attentiveness of the chef and waitresses were a class up.There are 3 dinner sets to choose from $220 to $450. I had the $300 Omakase Wa. It was the most filling and satisfying Japanese dinner in Singapore.The set consists of appetiser, assorted sashimi, assorted cooked dishes, nigiri sushi and maki sushi, Soup and Japanese fruits. All the seafood were of course as fresh as it gets. The chef was skillful in his craft and my friend and I had the chef to ourselves till middle of our meal when a couple came in. I guess the chef made most of the experience in this restaurant memorable. A small portion of the jelly dropped on the table. After i finished the whole jelly, he took a piece of tissue, leaned forward, said a word of sorry, and cleaned off the jelly on my table. Most people would think the chef's main role is to make good food but in this fine restaurant, the effort and attentiveness of the chef was amazing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good Sushi ,1,50,23-Jul-16,I lived 5 years in Tokyo and this Place is definitely up to Par with good places in Tokyo. Highly recommended. Will go again.

Recommended to come.
Service is good.
Again, I must stress that for the price you pay, you can get better quality in Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best Meal of My Life - WOW, thanks Yoshi (Sunsuke Yoshizawa - Head Chef)",1,50,12-Jul-16,"I was incredibly luck to get invited by a business colleague to try Shinji at Raffles. To be honest, other meals at Raffles have been unremarkable, to Shinji was truly impressive. I am also lucky I did not have to pay, the bill was over $1100 Sing for two people. We were stuffed and had two bottles of high-grade sake. The sushi was pure amazing and Head Chef Yoshi was great and incredibly attentive. Not so sure I would want to spring for a $600/person dinner, but it was one of the finest meals of my life."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town,1,50,28-Jun-16,"We have been to Shinji by Kanesaka for several occasions and every time, the food was excellent. Though pricey, the quality of the fish is well worth the money. If you want to have a once in a lifetime sushi experience while in Singapore, choose the chef's menu and enjoy the freshest fish in town."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Big Bang, lotsa buck",1,50,26-Jun-16,"Tucked away in a discreet corner of an opulent western hotel is this magical enchanting gem of a sushi restaurant. Quiet, understated, discreet. Perfect. Great great great food at the counter. Multiple courses of Japanese seafood delicacies, each more subtle, more intricate than the last. Awesome sushi made in front of your seats, seeing and delivery all part of the charm. Marvellous. Not for the budget conscious. $800 sg for two was not a big spend here so save the pennies! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Undisputedly good sushi,1,50,20-Jun-16,"Our sushi experience here has set the bench mark for future endeavours!Service was superbly good. Hot teas were promptly refilled, the placement of the ginger on the serving plate was switched upon finding out that my husband was a leftie, and not forgetting the hilarious party get-up that the chefs adorably put on to sing both of us a birthday song! Plus points there!The food was amazingly good (even better than the ones we had in Japan). The uni sushi was so creamy that it melts and slides down your throat.We understand from the chef that they fly in the fishes from Tsukiji market 4 times a week! Freshness guaranteed!To Chef Takahiro Ishizawa and his team, thank you so much!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very authentic sushi experience in singapore,1,50,13-Jun-16,"I think out of all the premium sushi restaurants in Singapore, this is one that match up to Tokyo micheline sushi restaurant.
Omakase is worth the money!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town!,1,50,19-May-16,"We have heard and read so much about this place so had high expectation. We were not disappointed.This was by far the best sushi I have had in my life! Every ingredient flown in fresh from Japan, every piece prepared with great care and attention. Not to mention the superb taste!Every single piece was perfection in a mouthful. What more can I say!I would definitely be back!Personally I preferred sushi over the omakase, which my husband had, but that is just personal preference. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing experience,1,50,6-May-16,"Excellent place to try authentic Japanese cuisine!
Chef Keisuke Fukasawa is outstanding - I would recommend to book the sushi corner to see the process and chat with the chef ??"

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi outside of Japan,1,50,13-Mar-16,"After several deliberations with other close contenders in Bangkok, I have concluded Shinji as the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. The decision is based on taste and serving practice by the chef, and Shinji is my winning choice. Value is also pretty reasonable - though price can be perceived on the high side, the quality, ingredients, and amount of courses offered makes it very justified. You finish your meal on a high note - satisfied with such unmatched flavors and undeniable freshness with attentive service, having an overall satisfaction on dollars well spent.Shinji would be the number 1 nominated choice if looking for the highest quality sushi outside Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",An excellent sushi-ya experience,1,50,22-Jan-16,"Had a lovely meal at Shinji by Kanesaka. My sister had pre-booked the Omakase Shin menu - their premium Omakase menu beforehand and so we did not have to make any choices for our dinner. The pacing of the meal was excellent as we had a little private room to ourselves. We were served a variety of appetisers including the infamous shirako (cod's milt) which was a very interesting eating experience indeed! Our chef for the night was very accommodating with all our requests - for example, when my sister mentioned that she found the wasabi very strong, he made sure that her portion of sushi contained less wasabi. Overall, a very expensive dinner but one which was worth every penny."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best Omakaze in Singapore,1,50,20-Jan-16,"Its my second time to try Omakaze in shinji.Its surely one of my favourite restaurant when i visit singapore.Shinji has the most japanese chef that i've seen in singapore.Their sashimi is very fresh, just like Tsukiji market in tokyo.Must book as they are fully packed."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite artwork in food!,1,50,12-Dec-15,"Shinji has some of the best sushi, if not the best sushi I have ever had. The ishi knows what they are doing and concentrate on the task at hand with great precision.
It is pricey but my goodness it's worth it!!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible - The Best!!,1,50,29-Nov-15,"Having read numerous reviews I was worried by expectations would be too high and would be left disappointed after dining. I was so wrong! Even with the highest of expectations Shinji managed to surpass them. A great meal, friendly and knowledgeable service staff (ask them anything and I bet they will know) and beautiful environment. I will be back !"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SUSHI EXPERIENCE,1,50,25-Nov-15,"This is very classic, simple, absolutely delicious sushi. No mayonnaise based sauces here. At times the sushi master studied the piece of fish looking for the exact way to cut it (this was not a show) and precises placed droplets of soy or juice to the exact spot on the fish."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing,1,50,20-Nov-15,"We had dinner at Shinji at Raffles Hotel a couple of weeks back, and it was nothing short of amazing. The sashimi was so fresh, especially the uni, it took us right back to Endo Sushi at the Osaka Fish Market. Dishes that came with sauces were delicately and thoughtfully put together and tasted absolutely heavenly. We had some sake to go with it, and that was delicious too. Finally, the seasonal fruits (and ice cream) that they served at the end of dinner were also of the finest quality. All in all, a gastronomically pleasurable experience.Service was of course, impeccable. We also appreciated how game the chefs were to dress up as they brought out the fruit platter, complete with candles, and sang happy birthday to just about all of us (just happened that 5 of the 6 couples at dinner that night were either celebrating an anniversary or a birthday). We would love to return again and share this experience with our friends and loved ones."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elevated my standards ,1,50,14-Nov-15,Shinji elevated my standards of what to expect for a premium Omakase. At these prices (300SGD/person) there is a high likelihood of being let down. There was not a single flaw. Each very attentively prepared and served piece better than its weaker versions I have had in LA. You won't be let down
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply amazing,1,50,4-Nov-15,Tried the new Shinji at the St Regis last month. Was so impressed by it and was dying to try the original at Raffles hotel. Got to say they are both stunning. Without doubt the best sushi in town. The counter service is very personal as well with the chefs keen to entertain and engage. It is pricey but it is the place to impress clients and special ones.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Perfection ,1,50,1-Nov-15,One of the best sushi i have ever ate. Sashimi and nigiri were divine. Not cheap at all but was worth it all- sea food was very high quality.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great place ,1,50,31-Oct-15,Sushi bar. The entire family and extended clan decided it was one of the best sushi joints around. The sushi and sashimi were just very good. Do ask for their short-fin uni which was sweeter and really nice. Great service as well. It is cheaper during lunch rather than dinner. 
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",tokyo class sushi,1,40,26-Oct-15,very high standard but expensive but it gets the job done! it's all sushi and best to have the omakase
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Thank you Chef Ishi ! See you soon,1,50,24-Oct-15,"The Chef Ishi do is best and more so that you spent a memorable evening.And it is the case.Sushi seems today very simple because very popular but a real sushi it is very complicate and so rare !Here eveything is perfection. The choice and the quality of fishs, the cutting of those one and the slightly tepid rice basing in mouth.But I have to deliver an important message. This place is for Wealthy Connaisseurs. WHY ?Because they are probably the best sushis that I ate ever all arround the world including Japan. But the excellence has a price !.It is thus necessary to have a developed palace if you wish to keep a fantastic memory at the time of the bill ($ 800.- for 2)I'll go back"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best ever,1,50,18-Oct-15,We went to Shinji for lunch and I must say it was one of the best Japanese food I ever had. The sushi is prepared individually with the freshest fish.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Super Shinji ,1,50,11-Oct-15,"Been here a couple of times for lunch, and had dinner at the st Regis branch. This is my first dinner at this original raffles hotel branchThe menus are the same between Regis and raffles. Opted for the Wa menu again , the middle oneA procession of gorgeously prepared food came. The sushi and sashimi are all divine. The cooked food like miso cod etc. are also of a much higher standard than elsewhere Sake prices are not sky high There was a couple celebrating their anniversary and the chefs put on their funny masks and broke into song. Always so hilarious when they do that. Wonderful "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Impressive meal,1,50,6-Oct-15,Every piece of nigiri was excellent. Each piece of seafood was of the highest quality. Absolutely delicious
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",About the best sushi you can get in Singapore! Excellent,1,50,20-Sep-15,"Counter seating only. Casual atmosphere. Attentive sushi chef who's obviously out to please. Every dish of the degustation menu was splendid in taste and presentation. Couldn't have asked for better. Pricey, memorable sushi."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply great,1,50,20-Sep-15,"Definietly one of the best sushi restaurant in Singapore. All the dishes - not only sushi - are simply delicious. Needless to say, a bit pricy but considering the location and the cost for bringing all fishes from Japan, that might be necessary. Other than the food, I like when strict-looking chef shows humorous side to celebrate customer's Birthday."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",exquisite sushi,1,50,12-Sep-15,"We had an exquisite lunch at the Shinji Raffles Hotel. The short menu is of 9 sushi courses, mostly tuna. The tuna simply melts like butter in the mouth and the service was wonderful. Pricey at $200 but you are paying for quality."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Exceptional sushi, this is an art! Mind-blowing!",1,50,7-Sep-15,"Made a lunch reservation for 2 through email and the restaurant replied very quickly, hassle free! Upon arrival, we were greeted politely and made to sit at the beautiful sushi bar. The restaurant was very quiet and ambience was fantastic. Ordered the 15-piece lunch set and was not disappointed at all! EVERYTHING-from the appetisers, to the nigiri sushi, to the desserts at the end...everything was perfect, flawless. Highlights of the meal were definitely the Uni, Chutoro and Otoro! The grilled tiger prawn is worth a mention too! This meal is just too good! Friendly chefs and brilliant service. Definitely will be back in no time."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",good sushi but overpriced a bit,1,40,22-Aug-15,"i would say it might be a good sushi restaurant overall. But i doubt it can be really claimed as best sushi outside Japan. I would expect better food given it's ranked top 50 asian restaurant among just a few Singapore restaurants. nice place with good privacy and intimate. The Japanese chef is professional and friendly. what's more, he can speak some English, same as Japanese waitress. Service is good. I ordered 9piece sushi lunch set given limited lunch time. It starts with a few very ordinary sushi in terms of quality of sashimi on the top. but toro and prawn sushi was excellent. i think the quality of sushi is good but just not the quality of the material (most are just ordinary material we can try at normal japanese restaurant). with tax and service charges, it costs ~SGD90 for the set, which is a bit overpriced. Their dinner is super expensive, al SGD250+"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but explicit ,1,50,4-Aug-15,"The level of quality here is too dream for in Europe. Our chef was explicit and professional. Service and food was perfect. The only minus is the high price. The ""big"" omakase is expensive, but with a menu including 4 kinds of Uni, you will expect this. Sake was absolutely great. Best sushi experience outside and maybe inside of Jspan. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Definitely top 3 in Singapore ,1,50,1-Aug-15,"Went with a group of 6. The bill came up to $2400 including a bottle of sake. The food is at its' freshest and finest. Is authentic jap food with no fusion. They do it the traditional way. Do request for room sitting, u have better privacy then the main hall. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",wonderful,1,50,24-Jul-15,I tried this food outlet for a couple who love me. they asked me to bring a friend to this restaurant. they tried this food a lot of times alrdy. they love it so much that they call it their darling.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistently delicious.,1,40,20-Jul-15,"I have visited shinji at Raffles hotel 3 times within the past 10 months, they never fail to deliver a high standard of finely crafted sushi.Ever since my first time at Shinji, it opened my mind on how good sushi can be. Ever since then, i've abandoned all the other seafood rice masquarading as 'sushi'. End of the day, you get what you pay for in Singapore. I'd gladly pay as i know i am in very good hands."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Totally worth the price!,1,40,13-Jul-15,I tried and loved the sister restaurant in Macau and decided to give the one in Singapore a try. I wasn't disappointed! You can choose from three different sets and I went for the biggest one. Totally delicious but way more than I could eat. The four varieties of sea urchin was amazing! The sashimi and sushi were fresh and super delicious. Sake was very good too. Fantastic meal.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I had in Singapore,1,40,7-Jul-15,"As a Sushi Lover, I tried to squeeze my time from all the meeting just to try this restaurant. Cost for dinner is quite high, 300 SGD ++ for Omakase course. But I have to say that I was satisfied. Wabasi here is extreme strong but yet give you a very good experience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Love the sushi,1,50,30-Jun-15,"I love the sushi there. The service staff and sushi chef are friendly. They can speak good English so don't worry if you don't speak Japanese. They carry good range of sakes. You can ask for sushi bar counter when you make reservation. Most of the time it is full so please make reservation in advance especially weekend is very crowded. Recently they have just renovated the restaurant, but not much different (extra private dining area). The ingredients are fresh and mostly imported."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese food at its best,1,50,30-Jun-15,"We went there for our wedding anniversary lunch. And boy, we were not disappointed. We had the Omakase and we were very impressed by everything that was served by the chef. Food was so simple and delicious and we enjoyed watching the chef in action. Definitely worth the price and it's a really nice place for special occasions. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very Good Quality Tokyo Style Sushi Rest In Spore,1,40,26-Jun-15,Have not been to Shinji quite some time but it's still one of my favourite REAL sushi place for top quality Tokyo Ginza Style sushi.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$16.67++ per piece,1,40,26-Jun-15,"That's the cost per piece of sushi. I must say regardless of the price that the sushi was really good. Fresh, artfully prepared and the service was great. It was an experience and not just putting food in your belly. The ambience, attention the chef gives and the great service the waitresses gives makes it an experience. For 15 pieces you pay $250 which works out to be $16,67 per piece. But really you pay $250 for a 2 hours experience which works out to be about $2 per minute :) They do have the $300 and $450 menu as well."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Mouth watering,1,50,18-Jun-15,Had the Omakase set for $250. It was worth it. Had a few reviews saying that it is the best outside Japan and I have to agree that it is the best sushi I have ever tasted (excluding the ones in Japan since Ive never been there).Staffs are friendly and will ask if you have any allergies prior to serving you the food. The chef will explain what sushi he prepared for you. Reservation is recommended. Did my reservation using e-mail so the restaurant is quite efficient.Will definitely come back here again.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A finger of wasabi,1,50,16-Jun-15,"Finally had the chance to head down to Shinji tonight with my boyfriend and his father. We were served by Chef Yoshi.He was excellent in communicating with us and also, more importantly, preparing the wonderful feast we had in store.The food was amazing, the service was superb. Couldn't have asked for anything more."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Slighty expensive omakase yet I enjoyed it,1,50,16-Jun-15,"Opted for the Shinji at Raffles Hotel to see the much hyped cypress tree table. Bigger seating (16 if I counted correctly) than most of the sushi master restaurants in Ginza (Tokyo). Had the omakase shin menu. Indeed a tasting delight in my opinion cause every fish, fruit and vegetable is caught and cropped then flown in from Japan. One can taste the difference on the awabi, kinmedai and uni (Hokkaido and Kyushu) being served. The downside were the nigiri pieces were not up to mark cause they used less vinegar on the shari. Perhaps customers should be given a choice if they prefer a stronger taste. The akagai and simmered tuna pieces too fell short as both lacked a richer umami. Slightly more expensive compared to Tokyo for the price I paid excluding sake. Japanese beef or other grilled items except tuna steak was not part of the menu and didn't get the maki roll standard in most sushi courses. Worth it to sample one of the best restaurants in town once in a blue moon."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good sashimi,1,40,23-May-15,"Went there on thursday night made rsvp 3 days before. Restaurant located on 2nd floor, at first it was a bit hard to find in such a big hotel. The restaurant is very small. All of the seats are in the sushi bar about 20 seats. The chefs were 4 with 3 waitress. We ordered omakase wa. Omakase means we trust the food to the chef. There were 3 choices. One is set menu around SGD 220++ omakase wa is SGD 300++ and the highest omakase is SGD 450++All the fish they serve all import from japan 4 times a week. So they guarantee the freshness and best quality. The chefs are young fun polite and very friendly. They even drink several glass of sake with other customer. They explain each dish they serve including how to make fresh wasabi.With the price and type of dishes we got, I would say it's overpriced. We paid SGD 1260 for 3 omakase and a bottle of sake. However if you are looking for good authentic fresh sashimi, go to Shinji. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top quality ingredients. Great service.,1,40,22-May-15,"This is a really small space, basically just seats around a sushi counter but it is a 2 Michelin-star restaurant! The service was superb and ingredients used were of top quality. The chef asked if there were any ingredients that we don't eat, took note that I don't take squid and replaced it with fresh shrimps. Two of us, we ordered a nigiri sushi set and an omakase set, and the chef very thoughtfully split the two sets among us so that we both got to try everything. My favourites of the dinner were uni (sea urchin) and akami (tuna belly). Melted in the mouth! Each grain of rice was round and full. Dessert was musk melon and matcha ice cream, not too sweet, very subtle on the palate which was a great way to finish the dinner wholesomely."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for!!,1,50,17-May-15,"Shinji by Kanesake, tucked away in a quite corner of Raffles Hotel and best loved hotel. Singapore has plenty of Japanese restaurants right from the chains such as Sushi Tei to the celebrity chefs. Shinji falls in the highest category when it comes to Omakase restaurants in Singapore, it is located in the colonial Raffles Hotel and is set up in traditional Japanese style with tables by the sushi counter and then some private rooms. An omakase menu is featured and skillfully executed by a native Japanese team of artisan chef's. They have 3 or 4 set menus that one can choose from, most have a similar base of dishes with some add-ons. The chef asked us whether we wanted a selection of sashimi and sushi or just sushi. We opted for a combination.We were treated to yellow fin tuna, needle fish, sea urchins in sashimi and then blue-fin tuna, spanish mackerel and horse mackerel, my personal favourite was Sword fish.For desserts we were served the musk melon with salted ice-cream. And that was a fantastic end to a great meal. All along, the service was great. Do note, as with most high end Japanese restaurants, this one too charges top dollar and is usually frequented for business dinners or special occasions."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Pricey but worth every cent,1,50,8-May-15,"Went there with my wife in March 2015. Had to make reservations about 2 weeks before my date. Took up the seats on the counter where you can have first hand interaction with the Chef. We gave the Chef the luxury of delighting us with his choice of dishes for the evening, and he also recommended the sake. I must say the food was excellent. The sashimi was the freshest I have ever tasted. There was also a number of fusion Japanese dishes which he so proudly created. The Chef's creation is a must try. Very unique and mouth watering as I write this article. My wife and I will definitely go back there again. The only setback is that the dinner will put a hole in your pocket. My damage for the evening was SGD1,500 but like I said, Pricey but worth every cent!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Highest quality sushi, but lack of variety",1,40,6-May-15,"Having heard about this restaurant's stellar reputation, I went to the branch at Raffles Hotel for lunch. You definitely need to book ahead to eat here, as the place is small and there are only 18 seats around the sushi counter (they do have private rooms but you won't see the actions from there). Several guests were clearly regulars, which is a good sign for restaurant of this level.The lunch set menus start at $75 up to $250, which can be considered ""cheap"" compared to dinner ($220 to $450). The $250 option comprises of about 9 nigiri sushi plus appetizer, sashimi, and cooked dishes. If you are a lover of Japanese cuisine, the usual suspects for high-end sushi are likely to be in the menu (the fatty tunas chu-toro and o-toro, sea urchin, bonito). But the most impressive items (that I had not seen before) came at the start - the baby squid and the translucent baby eel, both served as sashimi. As for the quality of the cut and freshness, you can hardly complain - this is probably as good as it gets, at least outside Japan. However, with this price tag I'd really like to see more variety in the set menu. Tuna came up several times, as did sea urchin. They could, for example, serve more shellfish, e.g. clams or oysters. And the dessert (green tea ice cream and melon) was too plain for me. I honestly didn't get all the fuss about Japanese melon - for me it only tasted slightly better than the normal one. So I was satisfied, but not extraordinarily so. Perhaps if you go for dinner and pay $450, you'd get more ""exotic"" stuff. But then it's getting to be too expensive. Or you can try bringing a gift (a bottle of sake) for the head chef and the staff, which is what the regulars do. This might persuade the chef to part with some of his more prized possessions..."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for !,1,50,1-May-15,We had read about this restaurant and were not disappointed worth the price if you like exquisite sashimi served by a master. The timing was perfect and the chef delighted with continual questions made this meal special. Also fish we don’t get in Australia. The Yuzu sorbet desert still lingers.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding sushi,1,50,29-Apr-15,"Singapore has plenty of Japanese restaurants right from the chains such as Sushi Tei to the celebrity chefs. Shinji falls in the highest category when it comes to Omakase restaurants in Singapore, it is located in the colonial Raffles Hotel and is set up in traditional Japanese style with tables by the sushi counter and then some private rooms. They have 3 or 4 set menus that one can choose from, most have a similar base of dishes with some add-ons. The chef asked us whether we wanted a selection of sashimi and sushi or just sushi. We opted for a combination and were fed a variety of wonderfully fresh fish. We were treated to yellow fin tuna, needle fish, sea urchins in sashimi and then blue-fin tuna, spanish mackerel and horse mackerel. All flown in that morning from Japan. They did serve a few non-fish dishes which too were fantastic. For desserts we were served the musk melon with salted ice-cream. And that was a fantastic end to a great meal. All along, the service was great. Do note, as with most high end Japanese restaurants, this one too charges top dollar and is usually frequented for business dinners or special occasions."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Another faultless dinner,1,50,22-Apr-15,"My second visit, and another memorable meal that did not disappoint. Expensive, but excellent value and well worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore now I m convinced,1,50,7-Apr-15,"Title says It all, and I am very very very demanding about Sushi ...probably one of the only two places in Singapore that comes close to the quality which you can get in the top places in Tokyo"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Highest grade,1,50,3-Apr-15,The food here is exquisite. The chefs exude disciplined knowledge of their trade. The sushi is literally tailored to your tastes. Setting is dull but the event is the food and service. Madness to miss.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisitely good,1,50,25-Mar-15,"My husband and I celebrated our birthdays together, we were brought there by our son and daughter-in-law. Sitting at the counter we were served the freshest and exquisitely prepared pieces of fish and seafood. The chef singlely, devotedly delivered his creations to his guests and clearly explained from which part of Japan they came from. We are quite amazed that they come from almost every far corners of the country. Tell him your likes and he will offer that extra portion of otoro. It was not inexpensive, the lunch omakase was $250 per person. The meal ended magically when all lights went off and 3 clown-faces popped out to sing happy birthday! What a lovely surprise."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great quality fish and freshness. ,1,40,19-Mar-15,"The product is so fresh and we'll prepared but the pricing spoils the experience somewhat. Will return next trip though.
Excellent."

Ambience is 8/10

Price is 7/10(really exp but that's the price for good quality Jap food in Singapore)
Overall is 9/10!
Must try!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive well executed formula,1,40,17-Mar-15,"Excellent quality of interesting sushi, as one would expect from suh a high end restaurant. Wife and I have been sevedral time never really spnding less than SGD1,000 for the meal admittedl with nice bottle of sake at dinner.Every thing Japanese, chefs and most of staff when we there (dont' know how foreign employee controls impact them). Not much to gripe if on can afford to eat at this restaurant apart from a strange sterile experience after the first time. Don't get me wrong - consistent excellent execution is a sign of top knotch quality - perhaps a little too formulaic.So perhaps, in conclusion, a must try but don't go too often even if you can afford it :)"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing and Fresh Sushi ever had in singapore,1,50,17-Mar-15,it is this is best sushi outside Japan which is so fresh and tasty. Amazing taste and service is good and staff is well trained. Chef is amazing
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese food I experienced in a long time.,1,50,17-Mar-15,"Fantastic Japanese food. Freshest and one of the best quality I experienced ever.
High prices but worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",INCREDIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE,1,50,15-Mar-15,"We chose Shinji by Kanesaka for our last dinner in Singapore and it was so beyond our expectations that we will long remember it as the standard for fine sashimi. You should know what you are getting yourself into before you go otherwise you might be a little overwhelmed. We ordered the Omakase at Singapore $330 each. For two hours we were entertained by these masters and fully satiated with the most exquisite sashimi we have ever tasted. We ordered a premium carafe (or three!) of sake, which tasted like silk. From the glass fish to the baby tuna, the Horse Head fish soup to the octopus it just kept coming. It is going to be impossible to top this!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic! Well Executed Japanese Restaurant,1,50,1-Mar-15,"Had the lunch sushi set 12 pieces (including Sea Urchin, Otoro, anago) over the weekend. We sat infront of the Master Sushi Chef Oshino. Felt like we had front row seats to a culinary art show. Great performance! He had a junior chef beside him doing the more basic tasks. It was nice to see the master teaching him and sharing with us some sushi preparation tips. The meal was expensive, but the quality of fish was very good (they import fish direct from Tokyo 4x/week). The best sushi for me was a tie between the sea urchin and the horse mackerel. Will be back."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Best Sushi You'll Ever Eat,1,50,19-Jan-15,"I had a superlative experience at Shinji for lunch. So many reviews said they were top notch so I was skeptical when I arrived. It was a Monday & I didn't have a reservation. No matter as the seats around the sushi counter were not all filled. Opting for the most luxurious or Omakase lunch (at S$250 a small fortune). But what was served was freshness itself & well worth the price though dining here would have to remain a treat, not an everyday meal. The omakase comprised a selection of sashimi, sushi, soup & dessert. I'd have to say my favourites were the platter of mixed sashimi ranging from mackerel to scallop. There was also a very clean tasting seaweed soup with scallops to begin with & was very pure but satisfying. Of all the sushi, I'd have to say my favourites were chutoro (tuna belly) and aji (horse mackerel). This is not a conveyor belt sushi restaurant so please resist the urge to dunk every piece of sushi in shoyu. The rice is slightly warm (in my opinion heightens the flavour & freshness of the fish) and you can taste the fish which is flown in from Japan all the better if unmasked by the soy. The meal was rounded off by a clam broth & the most perfect Japanese fresh fruit - musk melon & persimmon. You could not ask for more. I'd certainly return but perhaps opt for the less extravagant offerings as every meal here is an experience. You owe it to yourself to go. Chef Yoshi who serve me was attentive & professional as were the rest of the servers."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best,1,50,10-Jan-15,When you come to Shinzo you can expect great service and quality of food. I guess it's worth paying for such assurance. Chef never let you down. Our 3rd visit and we always leave happy. Thank you guys.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,1,50,30-Dec-14,"A unique experience, very fresh & well prepared sushi, excellent service. Booking a table is advisable. For a better price, go for lunch."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Clearly this is how Japanese food is supposed to taste,1,50,26-Dec-14,Accustomed to sushi off a conveyor belt this experience was an eye-opening feast. One which makes me wonder about the difference in quality of produce used at chain restaurants and premium locations like Shinji. It was a treat for me and one that will certainly stay on my all time favourites list. I learned for example that sushi served with warm rice tastes a whole lot better and I learned just how good tuna can taste.So the thing that I remember best about this meal is the fact that the freshness of the produce used is outstanding. One very simple course was the tuna and white leek maki. Lunchtime omakase costs less than dinner and makes it a little more approachable. Not the cheapest experience but certainly worth it.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",BEST SUSHI IN SINGAPORE!,1,50,23-Dec-14,This was one of the best sushi experiences and the best in Singapore. The lunch sushi sets are value for money.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent omakase!,1,50,20-Dec-14,"Our dinner was a great experience, sitting at the sushi bar (of the St. Regis) and being served directly and non-stop by the head chef who was friendly and fun. We went for the omakase and did not regret it as all items served were top-quality, and very tasteful. Serving staff was excellent, quick, but not intrusive, while the overall ambiance was very nice. Was it one of the greatest sushi meals one could have? Potentially yes. Was it worth the SGD 400 per person (incl. drinks)? Probably not. Point of improvement: they could introduce a long list of Japanese whiskies."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite Omakase,1,50,19-Dec-14,"As I’ve heard and read so much about Shinji before coming to Singapore and it’s been on my must-try places to eat for some time, I seized the opportunity to dine here on a recent business trip, and I must say, the experience was absolutely sublime and exquisite. It is simply the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. When I walked through the sliding door and the three Japanese sushi chefs behind the counter greeted us heartily, I had to double check that I had not been tele-ported to Japan. We sat at the sushi bar – an arrangement where chef and customer are in close interaction. Our chef Yoshizawa’s skills with his knives and attention to detail in his preparation of all the dishes really made for a personable and enjoyable dining experience. After having experienced Shinji for myself, I read with amusement some of the reviews written by other contributors, some claiming to be well travelled and knowledgeable. Example, “menu is less varied (no beef and few cooked dishes)”? – oh please don’t reveal your ignorance by asking for beef in an exclusive sushi restaurant. The best Japanese fine dining is found in specialty restaurants, where the spotlight is on just one dish, where chefs compete among themselves in the quality and taste of a particular dish, and where customers can experience the brightest examples of Japanese cuisine.That’s what I love about Shinji. It serves the best Edomae nigiri sushi which means sushi prepared with freshly caught fish in the traditional and purist style of the golden Edo period of Japan; hence don’t expect to find salmon or crab sticks.And, “sushi pieces being less innovative”? I’ve been brought to some other Japanese restaurants (shan’t name them here) where the chefs blow torch their fish or garnish them in the name of innovation, but it is just a vain attempt to mask the lack of freshness of the fish that can no longer be served raw. It’s like, I was told, in Chinese cuisine, if the fish is not fresh, one shouldn't cook it by steaming, but frying with chilli may conceal the bad taste.Is this place ridiculously expensive? I certainly feel that I had good value for my money and there are other Japanese restaurants in Singapore that you end up paying the same and even more for lower quality food and poorer dining experience. The good thing is, at Shinji, you know how much you are paying for your food. There are no off-menu special dishes. Many a times I’ve felt ripped off in other restaurants by staff who (in front of my guests) recommended expensive seasonal items and then charged an arm and a leg. At least at Shinji, the omakase menu is all inclusive. Certainly I give this restaurant two thumbs up!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi Experience,1,50,19-Dec-14,"Booked by email for noon, when I got there they could not find the booking. I was alone so they managed to find a seat at the Sushi Counter. You must book, as seats are limited, and I think it just turns around once for lunch.Read about this place in Trip Advisor. Staff was Japanese. Always within a few feet and making sure if glass was empty, or anything they would be there to help.Went for the middle sushi menu and deeply regret not having gone for the larger one, not because I was hungry but because of the experience.Don't go in a Hurry, I thought 12 pieces of Sushi should no take long (I got there at 12 and had a flight at 3). By 1315 I had to ask the chef how many sushis left, and there were still 5 to go. It right have been rude but I had to request him to slowly speed up the last as I had to rush.For each Sushi they open bring a Box from the Fridge underneath, open a Wooden Box, Extract a piece of fish, cut it and make the Sushi. If other diners next to you are at the same pace then they will make for them as well, if not all this procedure to make one Sushi.Rice is warm, perfect temperature to get an amazing taste. Fish amount is perfect. Wasabi is there and not overdone. Spectacular.As you eat he will see your pace and only start the next one when you have finished. Cleans your plate, and soon after places the next Sushi.The taste of Each Sushi was to die for.Regret: That I was not in a hurry and could not enjoy as much as I should have.Left the restaurant wishing to come back asap.It is expensive, each Sushi comes to around 8US$ (not for 2 but for ONE). I hate to say given the quality, to pay US$8 in many high end places for 2 sushis, I find this place comparatively cheap.Nothing to complain. Amazing Sushi experience.(Have read the review from the person who got sick from here. Accidents can happen anywhere, though I would love to know where he had had lunch that day. Food Intoxication can happen anywhere). Do not stop going here because of this review. Don't go if it is beyond your budget, and if you dont like Sushi.By the way No Soya Sauce. my belief is that if the quality of the produce is good, you never need and additives.Writing this and wishing I could eat there again.Thank you for the experience."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elegance and attention to detail,1,50,15-Dec-14,"My wife and I treated ourselves for lunch at the sushi counter at Shinji. The menu is based on either 9 piece, 12 pirec of 15 piece meal for sushi. omakase is over the top expensive for lunch at SGD$250++. the 9 piece foes fo $75++ and and 12 piece for $125++. The maths did not work out but the quality in the 3 extra I had made the difference in price! Very Japanese - waitresses all were Japanese, clad in Kimonos and the service was discreetly attentive. The sushi came with huge chunks of fish - as fresh as can be. The attending sushi chef explains each morsel as he makes it one at the time. He even paces the courses so that we are in ""sync"" A great meal - ate with my hands as recommended and the odour of fresh sardine lingered on for the afternoon on the fingers! Worth an experience just to splurge."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,1,50,9-Dec-14,"An absolutely fantastic dining experience.Seats about fourteen (so make sure you book), all around it's main sushi counter where you have your own chef preparing your lunch/dinner in front of you. The decor is classic and simple and feels like Japan.We were here for lunch and opted for ""Tsuki"" (12 pieces of sushi) and were blown away. I have no idea what each individual piece was (couldn't quite understand our chef), but I can confirm the ingredients were incredibly fresh and of the highest quality. The rice was warm and filling, with each piece of fish having a perfectly judged amount of wasabi. It was a delight to watch a chef, clearly at the heights of his profession, go about his craft. There is not much in the way of non-fish so be warned if that's not your thing.Service was wonderful. Attentive, unobtrusive, and charming.A lovely restaurant and one we would love to visit again. Very good experience."

This time, I managed to sit at the bar, It was great experience to enjoy such high end Japanese food."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top Sushi,1,50,5-Dec-14,"Stumbled on to this place first night in Singapore. Was not disappointed. First class sushi in a simple but nice dining room with attentive staff and great chef. One of the best sushi meals I have had.Fair to say it is not at all cheap but the quality of the ingredients, the care in preparation and the overall experience means it is worth every penny.Also fair to say that the omakase (chef's choice) dining style means that you might get some unusual ingredients. A few reviewers seem to have been put off by this. However, if you are brave, all of the food is an experience. If not, we saw quite a few diners ask the chef to steer clear of unusual items and they were graciously accommodated.Well deserved it's good reputation on TA. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Absolute amazing melt in ur mouth dinner,1,50,4-Dec-14,I cant recall having fish like this outside of Japan so well done to Shinji !!!

The whole experience is great with all the chefs super talented and trained to deserve being on the line. Fish is air flown fresh and each one has a special sauce and sequence to be eaten. Lunch prices are cheaper tha dinners and your guests will sure have a memorable experience. To me its the best in town and have been there many times and never dissapointed !
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Out of this world,1,50,29-Nov-14,"I decided to try this place having read so many pleasant reviews on blogs/Tripadvisor. My expectations were set high before visiting and I must say I left the restaurant extremely satisfied. I have never tasted such delicious sushi in my entire life. These guys really make sushi an art.I tried the lunch Omakase ($250++) so total bill came up to just under $300. I marvelled at the ingredients used - all top notch. Sitting at the sushi counter watching the chef whip up our sushi was a real delight.While eating the sushi, I ran out of superlatives to describe how good each piece was.My suggestion - if you can afford it, don't even think about it. Just go."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese food at its best,1,50,16-Nov-14,"This restaurant is in the Raffles building but is not officially part of the hotel. I went to have a look in the afternoon with a view to eating there that evening by myself. They wanted to know where I was staying and how to contact me before they would make the booking. I can understand that they might be worried about people not turning up as it is an expensive restaurant. Be prepared to pay a high price, but if you love Japanese food as I do, this restaurant is paradise. The food is prepared in front of you and every mouthful is a sensual experience and a work of art. With Japanese food, you think you will never be full, but after many little dishes, you begin to feel that you have had your fill. I ate mostly fish dishes, from little orange jewels of salmon roe to octopus. I don't drink alcohol and my bill came to 353 Singapore dollars, but I had no regrets as it was as good an experience as any of the attractions in Singapore and one that will live with me for some time. The kimono clad ladies ready to assist at every moment were delightful and the chefs are artists of great skill. "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A real dining experience,1,50,24-Jul-14,Having eaten in many Japanese restaurants in several countries (all outside of Japan) I have to say this is the best. Not only is the quality of the sashimi and sushi next level but it's a real dining expereince. Professional sushi chefs expertly prepare each course in front of you and serve it immediately. Every detail is perfect from the immaculately kept and incredibly sharp specialist knives to the centuries old (very expensive) wooden counter and chefs preparatin boards. Even the pickled ginger and wasabi tastes better.The restauarnt is very small so a reservation is essential - we went mid-week at lunch and it was full. Consequently the sevice feels personalised and is very attentive.As for the price: it's expensive even by Singapore standards but so worth every dollar. I cannot believe anyone would fail to be impressed by everything about Shinji. A must do venue if you're keen on Japanese food and visiting Singapore.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've Had!,1,50,14-Jul-14,"Loved Shinji. Came here with the BF during our stay in Singapore and was pleasantly surprised that the price for our experience paid off. We both had the $350 omakase that had variations of dishes and sushi. I eat sushi about 2-3 times a week and am kind of a snob. Most new places I try rarely live up to its hype or feeds me things that I've already experienced. Shinji on the other hand, served a couple of fish i've never tasted before and varying dish preparations that I have not experienced. It was full of firsts and melt in your mouth fish. Will definitely come back when in Singapore. Yoshi, our sushi chef was fabulous! "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",My favorite restuarant,1,50,6-Jul-14,"I firmly believe that this is quite possibly the best Japanese restuarant outside of japan. I always come back for more. I ordered the omakase set, the lighter one for my birthday. It started with some appetizers like uni and squid and then it got better. The sushi is very fresh but perfectly marinated and done with the touch of an expert chef. I loved the care in which the chef prepares each piece. Then there were some sashimi and cooked dishes. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. Highly recommended. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Heaven for food lovers,1,50,17-Jun-14,This probably is the best meal I have had. I have never been to Japan so if Sushi is better there then I hope I go soon. My client took me here and I have to say when I looked at the prices I blushed so try and find someone to take you there. The food is fresh and sculptured into bites of heaven. The Maki sushi was my personal favorite.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Will return,1,50,17-Jun-14,Had the hana 9 piece lunch set for $75. Every single sushi was an artwork and so skillfully prepared. It was a joy to watch the chef prepare it infront of you. Every piece was a delight. expect a lovely surprise if you go on your birthday!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A TASTE OF JAPAN IN SINGAPORE,1,50,12-Jun-14,"It is relatively expensive but try it once and you will be longing for more! Definitely worth a visit! I had the Omakase Wa for dinner. Ingredients were really fresh and service was immaculate! Chef was also really humorous and kept us entertained throughout. Make sure you ask for counter seats because it will make the experience so much better! For a more detailed review with pictures of every single dish, visit http://www.onefatsheep.blogspot.sg/2014/03/restaurant-review-shinji-by-kanesaka.htmlI spent $395 per person."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Food,1,50,27-May-14,"Shinji is a small restaurant where the focus is superb food and excellent service. It is one of the finest sushi restaurants I have visited and whilst the cost is considerable, so is the quality of the food and attention to detail. If you like sushi then it is a must visit ...."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible meal outside of Japan,1,50,18-May-14,Shinji is an impeccable dining experience. The fish is prepared in a traditional fashion and served with a delicate precision. Lovely wooden decor for the interior provided a comfortable setting for the meal. We would definitely recommend the omakase and you will not be disappointed. The highlight was when the chef revealed a box of uni and we watched as he prepared it for us as sushi. This is a restaurant in Singapore that is a must visit.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Incredible Japanese banquet,1,50,15-May-14,"Shinji is a cosy and intimate Japanese on the second floor of Raffles Hotel, with a traditional warm, soft wood interior. It has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite, helpful and impeccably efficient.We ate a ten course menu of gourmet seafood delights. The presentation was flawless and the variety exquisite. There were whole, deep fried hardshell baby crabs about the size of British fifty pence pieces - very crunchy - delicate sea urchin eggs, sushi and sashimi, accompanied by delicious sake. It was a lovely meal and the dessert selection of sticky, sweet moji, sesami and green tea ice cream, and a slice of melon provided a perfect close. By all accounts Shinji is the finest Japanese dining in Singapore. I wasn't paying, fortunately, as I understand that the prices are not for the faint hearted or weak of pocket. My friend blanched when the bill was presented, so I could tell it was not insubstantial. But as several reviewers have commented, sumptuous food and experienced Japanese chefs come at a premium. As long as you visit prepared for a fine meal and a large bill, you will not be disappointed.The owner, Mr Ong, and his wife were there, and made us feel very welcome. The restaurant is a credit to them."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic sushi,1,50,14-May-14,"We got a recommendation to have some sushi while in Singapore, we found this small place simple sushi bar in Hotel Raffle in Beach road. You enter to a small sushi counter, maybe 20 seats. Youa re severed by the chef directly. One of the best restaurants ever, simple, fantastically fresh, quality outstanding. Very simple to order, they just asked if we didn't eat something, then just served what they had and was good for the day, didn't need a menu.I will go back any day. Price is quite expensive, but for the quality fair. Reservation recommended"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi and sashimi,1,50,4-May-14,"Having dined all ovber the world and having grown a passion for Japanese food, I was totally gob-smacked by the expereince at Shinji. I tased varieties of seafood that I have never seen before (e.g. fresh spider crab) of a quality and freshness that bowled me over (e.g. sea urchin and tuna straight off one of their 4 weekly airfreight shipments from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo). The preparation was faultless and the service was excellent. Expect very little change from $1000 for two people even if you choose moderatley priced beer and sake rather than premium vintage champagne (and a bit more if you choose the top omakase menu called ""Shin"")but those who quibble about the price simply don't get it - it costs money to employ sushi chefs who have over 15 years of experience and it costs money to air-freight the best seafood you can find from Tokyo. If you are into Japanese this is a must-do expereince in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,1,50,18-Apr-14,"We had the 'middle' sized menu, lots of different mouthfuls of all sorts of things! The guy doing the slicing spoke pretty good English and explained it all as we went along. Puddings delicious as well. There was a lot to eat so make sure you are hungry when you go!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Awesome food- Fresh from Japan,1,50,6-Apr-14,"A friend bought me to Shinji for dinner. what i liked about the restaurant is that we were seated around the counter right in front of Chef Oshino! He whipped up his culinary skills, slicing all the fresh produce pretty skillfully. very patiently explaining to us what the dishes were when served to us. Loved the servings as there were bite size and oh, the food were so fresh! We had a good 22 kinds of food, including the dessert, which was the sweet melon & mango, with sake. awesome dishes!Understand from my friend that she has to book in advance for the slot.. Just loved this little restaurant tucked at the 2nd floor of Raffles hotel."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fresh,1,40,26-Mar-14,Love the freshness and variety in the menu. Chose the S$300 course. Lovely food display. Reservation required as it is a small restaurant.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","So fresh, a real delight.",1,50,22-Mar-14,"On a recent trip to Singapore, I booked for lunch to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday, as he loves Japanese. I was hoping that the restaurant would live up to the hype that I had read on this and other websites. I had emailed for the booking about 2 weeks out and had to confirm the morning of our booking, otherwise I would have forfeited my spot. The restaurant is set up in separate rooms with a chef central and table/bar set up around him so everyone gets an unimpeded view of the chef preparing the many dishes. our room had seating for 8 guests, but not sure if they are all the same.The food was magnificent and was very pleased to say the restaurant lived up to the hype. Attention to detail was extreme but graceful. It was like watching a performance, the prep, the reverence with the food, the effortless cleaning, the concentration on presentation, and the graciousness when being served. We had Keiichi san as our chef and he explained about the wasabi and how they grind it down using a shark skin mat, that is alarmingly sharp. Because we were a little later (our booking was for 2pm) we were the last in our room and had lots of opportunity to ask about the dishes, feel the balance of the knife and talk to the chef about his training and where he worked previously. I felt that our chef was very interested in explaining the dishes and general conversation, I didn't feel that we were putting him out or anything. The waitress was attentive but not annoying. She appeared at regular intervals when required, and otherwise gave us space. I really enjoyed this experience for the ambiance of the restaurant and the delightful food. If we make it back to Singapore would visit again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent,1,50,21-Mar-14,"In Singapore, this is the best I've tried so far. The sushi is really fresh and you can taste the difference in quality here. I enjoyed every single dish. But that's not all, there are little things I observed here that I think really makes this place stand out. For example, I am left-handed but I did not tell anyone at the restaurant that I was. Nevertheless, the chef must have noticed when I picked up my cup or adjusted my chopsticks, because all the sushi he served me was at the exact opposite angle of those served to other patrons, simply because this makes it easier for a left-handed to pick it up. The waiters also caught on to this later and any item they placed on the table was adjusted from right to left."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Absolutely delicious,1,50,17-Mar-14,"If quality top grade food is your priority, SHINJI is a MUST GO. I have called in on a Monday to book for lunch for Tues, however i was told that the restaurant was fully booked for lunch. Only to be surprised on Tuesday morning that seats were made available!Every single dish had the ""wow effect""! Ingredients were fresh and even the way the food were presented. The servers were exceptionally observant and attentive to our needs. Though its the second time I've been there, it continues to wow me and stays at the top of my MUST GO restaurants."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding experience,1,50,1-Mar-14,"Being served by Keiichi-san has been a true honour for my husband and I. we were looking for the best sushi dinner in Singapore and we found it here. No need to say further: service, ingredients, settings and food were excellent.Definitely we will come again and again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi We Have Ever had,1,50,27-Feb-14,"This is an amazing restaurant and worth every cent. It is difficult to get in, but it is worth the wait and the money. GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi,1,50,12-Feb-14,"Shinji is easily the best sushi restaurant in Singapore. I travel to Singapore on a monthly basis and I have become a regular customer there, you cannot get fresher sushi that the ones in Shinji. It is not cheap, but definitely worth every dollar of it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best food & best service from Kikuchi San!,1,50,11-Feb-14,"This was our third visit to Shinji (but first time to EOI branch).Kikuchi San was the sushi master who served us all this while.He was such talented chef. He prepared the food according to our needs, especially for my children. He knew that my children like kani maki (crab hand rolls), he especially prepared the real crab meat to make the kani maki for my kids. Usually the kani maki found in the market was the crab stick (make from fake crab or fish).Service was the best ever get from a fine Japanese restaurant.The food was imported from Japan everyday. They were fresh and juicy!The restaurant was sharing a same level restaurant space with another Chinese restaurant.Shinji EOI had only sushi counter which could only serve 8 to 10 guests per meal session.And it was the branch last day of operation. We were told they will be shifting to St. Regis soon.Can't wait to visit you again Kikuchi San!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistently Mind-Blowing,1,50,5-Feb-14,"Traveled to Singapore again, and naturally, I had to drop by one of my favorite restaurants here!I had dinner there on the 27th of January 2014 (for my wedding anniversary) and again, earlier this evening, to celebrate my best friend's belated birthday.1. Quality of the foodSublime - the ingredients used are so fresh!!!Any fresher, and my slices of chutoro would have marched right off the plate. I half expected the pieces of uni on my little dish to break out into song. Dishes are evidently meticulously conceived and well thought out - I love how they combine flavours. Pretty much the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore, imho, and it's really difficult eating anywhere else because the sashimi/sushi at all other restaurants just pale in comparison.2. Quality of the serviceImpeccable, as always.When you make a reservation, Shinji always makes it a point to contact you a few days before to confirm the reservation, and again on the day itself. They are quick to follow-up with you, and consistently extremely reliable. Lois, especially (the manager) is extremely professional, warm and very, very sweet. Erica, also, always makes me feel very much at home. The chefs really know their stuff - and are very passionate and dedicated. When one is at Shinji, one is truly in good hands: You will be able to experience true Japanese hospitality -- excellent service, Oshino-san/Yoshi-san's gentle, self-deprecating humor mixed with warmth & professionalism."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great service and fresh food,1,50,30-Jan-14,"Booked a lunch with my family here. Great email communications. Welcomed by 5 staff when arriving. Great to see Shinji preparing and overseeing the chef to deliver the nice lunch. Chosen the basic set menu thinking that we will need to have afternoon tea after this at Raffles as the menu only listed as 9 pieces of shushi. I was wrong, they keep on coming with extra appetizers and dessert and we were all full. Manager was very helpful and even give us suggestions for Chicken rice nearby. Seeing the chef meticulously preparing for every piece is really great."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb sushi in Singapore,1,50,22-Jan-14,"We had lunch at Shinji in the second floor of the Raffles Hotel shopping arcade, and it was a superb meal. Reservations for a Monday at 1:30 pm were easily made the day before. We had the ""9 piece"" set sushi meal, and the quality of the fish, the preparation of the nigiri and maki, and the pacing and sequencing of the meal were as good as we have seen anywhere, including Japan. This was ""edomae"" style sushi, meaning that seasoning is completely under control of the chef. We requested a couple of extras (shirako -in season in Japan- and uni) and these were superlative, but fairly pricy (at about 60 Singapore dollars a serving). So, to keep costs under control, stick to the set course. Regardless, given the superb sushi (and 250 ml of ""Ku"", a daiginjo sake), the total bill of about 400 Singapore Dollars for two was fair and competitive. It would not be that different (in price) from, say, a meal at Le Bernardin in Manhattan (admittedly, a very different kind of seafood cuisine). Only two things detracted from an otherwise perfect lunch. First, the maitre d'hotel was rather pedantic in informing us that extras would be expensive. It's a fair warning, but if coming to Shinji, the client should be prepared to pay dearly (maybe they've had unpleasant experiences with uniformed clients?). Second, the clientele around the sushi bar (and that is all that is available) seemed to be mostly moneyed Philistines, submerging their nigiri into soy sauce (remember, edomae-sushi), photographing each course as it came out, constantly texting, and just generally seeming to be incapable of appreciating what was being served to them. If your meal is helping to drive bluefin tuna to extinction, at least revere the fish. Neither of these issues, especially the second, are responsibilities of the restaurant, but be warned not to expect particularly cultured neighbors. Enthusiastically recommended for those seeking the best sushi money can buy."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Great food, even better chefs and service",1,50,30-Dec-13,"This is my 4th time here and Shinji always upholds the very high standards it sets itself. I observe different and new things each time i come and always learn something about japanese and sushi culture, so this adds to the eating experience. This time, i noticed they have ice cubes on all their cutting areas and i learnt it's so that the fish doesn't dry up on the table while being cut and end up spoiltCrowded and packed at 12pm sharp, this place is very popular and rightfully soOpted for my usual 12 piece lunch again. This time, the pieces seem a little smaller than the last time i remembered them, but they also had different items this time. The usual maguro, chutoro, otoro were excellent as usual. The ebi and anago were also very good. My favorite uni was its usual generous portion so no complains. This time, they added a bowl of ikura. Not a sushi piece, but an entire bowl. For those liking it , like me, it's a treat. For those who don't, oh well. To be fair, they do ask what you like or don't like at the beginning. But i think you do need to know your japanese food before coming here, and this is like advanced class, not for beginners. A previous reviewer gave this place a very low rating because ""it doesn't serve steak"". So obviously, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Or sheService was excellent as usual throughout, the chefs and waitresses all know what they're doing. This was actually my friend's birthday lunch and i mentioned this while making the reservation. I didn't think about it after. Nearly the end of our meal, the lights of the entire restaurant dimmed and the 4 sushi chefs came out with funny hats, glasses and bowties and sang happy birthday, carrying out a ""cake"". it was surprising and hilarious at the same time. What a nice gestureThis place is expensive, but 1 of the few to be really worth the money. After all, they have to recoup the cost of their 1 piece 220 year old japanese cypress which make up the entire sushi counter"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Loving Shinji,1,50,23-Dec-13,"I went to Shinji with my Dad's Japanese business partner. I have heard this place so many times but never had the time to try. Finally i could so..was excited because i love Japanese sushi sashimi a lot. Only fools don't like Japanese food lol it is healthy it is artistry. Anyway, all sushi sashimi were prepared specially by the Itamae and the menu was never-ending!! I will always go back to Shinji! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi,1,50,5-Dec-13,"We went to Shinji for my son's birthday on the trip to Singapore and it was such a unique, fun and special experience. All the dishes were great and with just enough theatrical execution without bring intimidating or too mysterious. The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays.The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance. We called it 'The best place for sushi in Singapore' and hope you think so."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","If the seafood is fresher, they will swim away!",1,50,30-Oct-13,"Ordered a Omakase Wa set at SGD350 per head. Offered the freshest sashimi & sushi while seated in full view of the head chef who prepares your portions. No private table for privacy. Wide range including the melt-in-your- mouth Chiu Toro & Otoro, uni, ubugai, anago. The only cooked food was a very delicious miso mackerel and a meatball soup. Dessert was a slice of sweet honeydew & 2 slices of pear."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good quality of food,1,50,29-Oct-13,We had great dinner here with great sushi rice The drinks were emotional and staffs worked great. The restaurant was easy to find and this got great ambiance.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",comparable to the best in Tokyo,1,50,18-Oct-13,"extraordinary personalised service, impeccable etiquette..I was a tad reluctant to have the Bluefin tuna, but didn't wish to offend my host..but, boy was it GOOD! sushi rice was the match of what I've had in Tokyo..the only other restaurant where I've had sashimi/sushi of this quality (outside of Tokyo) was at Kampachi in the old Equatorial Hotel, Kuala Lumpur"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",For sushi lovers,1,50,13-Oct-13,After visiting allot of singapore expensive restaurant's we arrived to shinji.For the first time I can say leave the money aside. Great food. Incredible sushi and the japanise experience is complete.Take the 12 sushi lunch menu. Dont hasetate to say what u dont like ex. Eel and ikora eggs.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in SIngapore,1,40,9-Oct-13,"Watching the chef to make sushi is unforgettable experience when we came to Shinji by Kanesaka. The chef is so professional . Ingredients are so fresh with raw fish , live shrimps... They all r delicious . Staff is attenative and active . They are humorous . We have great meal. We love sushi <3"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",""" Great meal """,1,50,26-Sep-13,"I come here through the recommendation of my friend and we don't disappoint. It is a little small room with only 8 seats. Food is very tasty. What is most interesting is watching the chefs make the food funding is fantastic. The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is really cozy. We especially like Shinji and wine here. the food is worth the value and I would recommend them! If you're a sushi fan, you will not be disappointed.."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worth-trying restaurant!,1,40,23-Sep-13,"An expensive but worth-trying retaurant!!! It is a little small room with only 8 seats but charming decorations, superlative and extremely fresh food – mouthwatering rice and ugami. It is more interesting to see your food handcrafted with the chef ‘s care, enthusiasm and skill! Its staff is also very attentive. Despite its expensiveness, it is one of the “1 in lifetime” experiences you should try!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",As Good as the one in Ginza,1,50,29-Aug-13,"We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and the same bunch of us had visited his outlet in Ginza a few months back. There is no way we could tell the difference between the two due to the excellent sake recommended by Kanesaka-san. If you are a sushi fan you won't be disappointed."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A meal to remember,1,50,26-Aug-13,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I went for lunch with a friend and we opt for my omakase meal. My excitement begins just right after I step into the dining area. This is my first purist style omakase meal, only fish and seafood. From the first meal served to us it was an edamame puree with ikura, I know that this lunch will be a memorable one.The fish is fresh and melt in my mouth, the Uni so sweet I can’t stop think about it till the next day. The sushi is so good, the rice is warm and kept at body temperature, and lastly and keep me impressed is the wasabi, so smooth and it’s the first time I taste wasabi as good as it gets. I’m fortunate enough that the master chef Koichiro Oshino is at our service. He made my experience there is well rewarding. The interaction with Chef Oshino is a real bonus lot of interaction and joking.I will recommend this sushi establishment for anyone who appreciate a quality sushi. It was fantastic. We had a really good time there, and definitely will go back there when we’re in town."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",More than just a meal,1,50,14-Aug-13,"Wow! What a restaurant! Delicious, fresh, welcoming, and well worth the extravagance.I made reservations for Shinji for my wife's birthday (a vegetarian who eats fish), and was certain that I'd be able to get something suitable for myself (meat eater who does not eat fish), as I normally do when in Japanese restaurants. When we sat down, it was explained that this was a fish only restaurant, and they had no meat...well, I was bracing myself for a long night of watching others eat! Our Maitre d' (I am sad that I never got her name) explained the concept, the fixed menu, and asked us for any particular tastes / exceptions to our diet - ""I'll be able to eat tuna..."". Our sushi chef Takahiro was given the challenge of making a menu to suit me, while my wife enjoyed an amazing array of fishy concoctions (sea urchin, salmon roe, octopus, baby squid, and several sashimi and nigiri fish courses as well as several more that I can't remember!). I was given the full array of tuna, with my favourite being the fatty, belly tuna (their fish is flown in daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, and they don't open when the market isn't open).The interaction with the chefs was a real bonus which was what made this the experience that set this meal apart for me, We've eaten some excellent sushi (again, mainly my wife) in Japan, and the interaction is good, but there seemed to be more communication here (possibly a language thing), and plenty of joking around...which leads me to my final point:I brought my wife here for her birthday, and at the end of the meal, the lights went out, and the chefs came out with a little sushi cake, dressed in funny glasses and hats and sung her happy birthday! A real, unexpected surprise which really touched us!It was a fantastic meal, we left fat and happy! Yes, it was pretty extravagant, but more than worth it. We will certainly be back next time we're in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding,1,50,12-Aug-13,"There's little else to say about Shinji. Go, pay up and be impressed. There is basically nothing to complain about and if you don't like the price you are simply in the wrong place, it is of the highest calibre from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave.The 12 piece option for lunch is more than adequate unless you are super hungry. Tuck in and enjoy and think about the credit card bill later, it is more than worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent,1,50,9-Aug-13,"This is by far the best japanese restaurant in singapore. The produce is very fresh, and can be tailored for specific requirements. Go try it for yourself."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Still prefer Sushi Kanesaka in Tokyo,1,40,2-Aug-13,"Having been to their main restaurant (Sushi Kanesaka) in Tokyo twice, I really wanted to like Shinji in Singapore. We went to Shinji for lunch (got the Tsuki set lunch for S$125 per person). For some reason, we were not wowed. Don't get me wrong. They serve very good sushi, and from what we learned, everything served came from Japan (flown into Singapore four times a week). Perhaps we were comparing the meal with the dinners at Sushi Kanesaka (which included more variety than lunch), but I would rate this as a ""Very Good"", not ""Excellent"".Having said that, this is still a good dining option if you are looking to eat high quality sushi in Singapore. We were fortunate to be served by Oshino-san (Kanesaka-san's second-in-command) who was very friendly and made us feel right at home."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Hands down the best sushi in Singapore,1,50,22-Jul-13,"If you are a sushi fanatic like me, go to Shinji. The quality and selection of fish are excellent. Flown in from Tsukiji in Tokyo, the quality is noticeable. This is a fantastic place to go and the chef himself is quite a character. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but totally worth the mondy,1,50,21-Jul-13,"Went to the branch in OUE as Raffles was full. Raffles is still better if you can get a seat. Small 8 seater restaurant, the chef was brilliant. Spent 1500 for 3 Pax and totally worth it. The sushi was pressed and made perfectly. Top quality ingredients. great pairing of starters. Abalone was perfect. Overall a fantastic experience and definitely worth returning again. Not as bland as Hiro and not as over the top as Waku Ghin but a place to come again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Art of Sushi,1,50,11-Jul-13,"I like to think of myself as well versed in Sushi but by no means an expert. My experience at Shinji Raffles was not only a culinary masterpiece but an educational one as well. On short notice I was able to secure a booking for lunch at the sushi bar. We were greeted warmly at the door and were seated promptly at the Sushi Bar which was around 75% full. My plan was to go with the Omakase and so with a quick glance at the menu and a consult with my dining companion we proceeded down this path. I won't bore you with too many details but to say that I proceeded to partake of some of the freshest and most artfully prepared sushi would be an appropriate statement. Of course what makes the experience so special is the Sushi Chef. Basically at the sushi bar you have one Sushi Chef taking care of no more than 2 or 3 couples at most. Don't know if it is because we ordered the Omakase but our Chef Kobayashi San was taking care of us only and just doing some support work for some other chefs. After the starting off with Sashimi, and then some cooked items, there was then a parade of Nigiri sushi prepared for us and they were eaten one by one with our hands as recommended by Kobayashi San. This excellent meal was topped of by a delicious hand roll and some exotic Okinawa Pineapple that was incredibly sweet and delicious. Each item presented to us was explained in detail by our chef which made the experience as educational as it was delicious. As noted in many reviews all of the chefs are from Japan and all of the fish and even the vegetables and fruits that we enjoyed were all from Japan. Kobayashi San advised that they have 4 air freight shipments a week. They literally have brought the best of Japan to SIngapore. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and experience to anyone who truly appreciates quality Sushi. This is not an inexpensive meal, in fact to date it is the most expensive sushi meal that I have had but I have no regrets as I feel the quality and the service warrant the price."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Shinji sushi,1,50,3-Jul-13,The best sushi I ever had. Very delicious rice And yummy unagi. Very well done! Will certainly come back.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing,1,50,25-Jun-13,"I was a regular at this fabulous Edomae Sushi Kanesaka in Tokyo. Kanesaka-san has opened Shinji in the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. 8 seats only, magnificent decoration and superlative food prepared by Joshi-san. A truly delightful experience extremely rare outside Japan. Run to Shinji and escape the Singapore Haze for a moment of happiness. Thank you Joshi-san!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great Japanese cuisine & nice ambience,1,50,25-May-13,"A truely enjoyable Omakase (???) dinner at Shinji @ OUE. The food are exquisitely done with freshly imported ingredients from Japan. Even the garnishes are specially selected, the Shiso flowers and Okinawa shio (salt). Also not forgetting the best sake, Juyondai (???), it is ultra smooth and paired wonderfully with the cuisine. Service crews are friendly and attentive which ends the dinner perfectly. Great dining experience. The ambience at OUE Tower makes the dining experience better than at Shinji @ Raffles Hotel.Though it quite pricey, overall worth the value.PS: Hope to see the Chef will present a different surpise in the next omakase dinner."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",By far the best sushi & sashimi in Singapore!,1,50,25-May-13,"I never knew sushi can be so delightful that with each mouth it makes me actually stop and savour the art behind each carefully prepared pieces of sushi and the freshness is undoubted. Exquisite! I usually avoid most ""tomago"" at sushi places and to begin with I am no fan of eggs but this is not that case when i head to Shinji, the tomaga has no ""eggy"" taste to hit and the texture is slightly springy and compact. The uni or sea urchin is creamy and makes me ignore my cholesterol levels. The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays. I must say it comes with a premium price tag but in my opinion if you are craving for excellent sushi then you can't go wrong with Shinji."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great dining experience,1,50,13-May-13,The ambience was fairly light hearted. All the dishes were great and with just enough theatrical execution without bring intimidating or too mysterious.With my pathetic japanese we still kept enough banter between the excellent sushi chef and had a great time.The freshness and quantity of uni more than justify for the price tag.The sushi were all very well balanced between the rice quantity. The vinegered rice was well moulded and have enough flavour on its own and complemented the raw fish beautifully.In fact we enjoyed the meal so much we had 3 bottles of sake between us and the sushi chef.It is not the cheapest place to dine but its well worth it as its as good as a 3 star michelin kaiseki in Kyoto.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Quite extraordinary - but pricey,1,50,4-May-13,"Agree with Neil French on this one - the prices (minimum $350 per person) are indeed second-mortgage-inducing. But the food is extraordinary - tasting the sashimi and sushi at Shinji was the equivalent of opening - and consuming - an old, very good bottle of Bordeaux versus your standard table red. A new standard was created that won't easily be surpassed.Service was solid, good selection of wines and sake, no one tried to kick us out at the end even as our conversation extended into the wee hours. Incidentally, we had a sushi-hater with us at the table, who decided to go with the flow re the set menu, and thought it was amazing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb each time,1,50,22-Apr-13,"My 3rd visit to Shinji and the experience always brings a smile to my face each time. They have a main dining area and a smaller one, and this time, i got a space at the cosier smaller section. Opted for my usual 12 pc lunch set (they have 9 pc, 15 pc and a OMG omakase set). Service was fantastic as usual, from the waitress to the sushi chef. The chef though japanese, helpfully said each piece of sushi in japanese and english, so that we can learn along the way too. Each piece was delicate and delicious, especially the 3 types of tuna, the uni, the unagi and egg. Even the miso soup you can tell was lovingly made and tasted good. Dessert was pineapple from okinawa (wow) with jelly. Fully booked again for lunch so do call ahead for reservations. 1 of the best japanese joints in south east asia, believe the majority here, it is that good. 1 reviewer who wanted to stand out gave Shinji a poor (2 star) rating and i was offended by everything he or she said"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best dining experience,1,50,23-Feb-13,"Been to many fancy places, but never felt as special @ Shinji... You of course get a 5 star service from Shinji just like you do from other establishments at this level. But something about seeing your food handcrafted with care, skill and passion make dining experience at Shinji extra special.The seafood is as fresh as it can be. The poor prawn was alive and kicking 5 mins before it landed on my plate in the form of sushi...the seafood selection is wide range, from the usual tuna to abalone to conch to sea urchin to white bait to ......The price is as expected, expensive, but it's worth the experience and without a doubt you get great food, service and ambiance"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wonderful experience,1,50,17-Feb-13,"Just recently went to Shinji for my birthday and it was such a unique, fun and special experience. The food was incredible, the sake delicious and the sushi masters lively, entertaining and very warm. It was super expensive but one of those ""once in a lifetime""experiences. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore!,1,50,24-Jan-13,"Went for dinner and had a great time. The food is fresh and the service is tip top! Apparently, the restaurant is so big on seafood from Japan only, they closed during the New Year period when Tsukiji market was closed. The master chef Oshino is a very talented and entertaining chef, and though it looks expensive, for the quality and amount of food..... super place to be dining in!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Destined to be SHINJI,1,50,22-Jan-13,"We attempted to charm our way into Shinji Raffles without a reservation.No way----downhearted and hungry we had no idea where to go.Suddenly, an angel appeared (I will call her J) and said, ""follow me...."".We found ourselves at SHINJI OUE TOWER where we enjoyed the finest sushi the four of us have EVER had!!!!Chef Kikuchi is an artist. The fish is so fresh and delicious ---the preparation creative and artistic.We are world travelers and dine in the finest restaurants----this is one of them!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've ever had,1,50,23-Dec-12,"My wonderful and now slightly broke boyfriend took me to Shinji for my birthday.Service was both faultless and intimate, the chef an absolute master. The quality of the sushi, sashimi and hot dishes was eye-opening - I made the mistake of asking if they had any salmon, to be told in no uncertain terms that no self respecting restaurant serves this fish! The bill was accordingly eye watering but both of us felt 100% justifiable, with this level of excellence you really don't mind."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Authentic sushi,1,50,11-Nov-12,"Probably the best sushi place in Singapore. You wouldn't be disappointed. Expensive. Service is perfect, staff is well trained, fish and seafood are extremely fresh. Make you reservation in advance"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ridiculously tasty. Very expensive.,1,50,28-Oct-12,"There's not much to say about the sushi really. It's extraordinarily good, served in a small cozy room by the sushi chef. Extraordinarily good. Couldn't ask for yummier sushi. However pay attention to the price. If this were in Japan I would say it is overpriced. Since it is in Singapore perhaps it is appropriately priced. Currently they offer a low cost dinner option at SGD$220, then ""omakase"" at SGD$300 or SGD$450. Anyway the food is great just make sure you're ok with the pricing."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best place for sushi in Singapore,1,50,7-Oct-12,"Received a warm welcome and were promptly seated at the counter. The master chef Oshino San attended to us and what an experience it was. The fish was excellent, meticulously prepared and beautifully presented. The timing of the meal was perfect. The other small dishes and the sake we were recommended were an excellent complement to the meal. We got a little insight into the seasonal fish as we bantered happily with the chef. It was not cheap but then an excellent sushi meal usually is not.The whole experience left us feeling very happy and satisfied."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Shinji,1,50,3-Oct-12,"Shinji and Au Jardin are probably the only 2 restaurants in tripadvisor's top 10 deserving of their placing here. There are many other good restaurants in singapore that are languishing in the lower ranks and they are beaten by Mcdonalds and Starbucks. sometimes tripadvisor's restaurant ratings just beat on a different drum...Anyway back to Shinji. Definitely a top 10 restaurant here in terms of food and service, and probably the best restaurant in raffles hotel. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the price is prohibitive but if you have to import fresh seafood from Tokyo twice a week, and you have to spend 6 years learning how to make an egg roll worthy of Shinji, they sort of need to charge this much. And yes, going for lunch instead of dinner will be lighter on the wallet. We took the 12 pc sushi lunch set and boy, was it a procession. Like all great japanese restaurants, they don't serve you all 12 pcs at 1 go. They first give you some appetizers, and then the sushi, piece by piece. By the time we had the 12th piece, and dessert, 2.5hours passed! and i was stuffed beyond belief. And of course, each thick fresh piece of sashimi on the perfectly vinegered rice was heaven. And of course, the egg roll which the chef took 6 years to learn how to make. Service was great, and the sushi chefs were very personable as well. Will need to return for more lunch sets"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi I have had,1,50,28-Sep-12,"Obscenely expensive, but obscenely good. I went with my wife there yesterday. The counter setting is very intimate and customer friendly - the chef makes the sushi right in front of you, including grating the wasabi root! The fish was obviously fresh and of the highest quality. My favorite was the sea urchin (we were served two different varieties from two islands) which I had never tasted before. Visit this place at least once in your lifetime."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Memories of Tsukiji,1,40,18-Sep-12,"Yes if i want to have a tokyo fix , i will visit my favorite sashimi place, most certainly one of the freshest sashimi & sushi in town and you will be paying for it . Be prepared to spend average $350 ( without sake ) and about $500 with sake . If you want to be sensible, go for set lunch ."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",perfect morsels of sushi,1,40,1-Sep-12,"easily one of the best high end sushi restaurants in singapore, the freshness of the fish is incomparable, and the temperature and texture of the rice is intentionally perfect. every morsels brings out the best of the ocean flavours. patrons are seated around a large sushi counter apparently carved out of one piece of wood though i thought the lighting seemed a bit bright. people talk in hushed tones in reverence to the zen-ness of the place. its interesting they dribble some soya/mirin dressing very lightly over every piece of sushi, but sometimes it does seem a bit salty for my liking. it is not cheap so best to go for lunch as there are 3 sushi sets from $75-180, and the omakase at $250. i hear that at dinner a similar omakase goes for $450. having been to sushi kanesaka in tokyo, which was simply mind-blowing with the variety and quality of the fish, shinji would suffice for folks not able to fly to japan for a sushi meal."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best in class,1,50,20-Aug-12,"Food: This is the best sushi/sashimi in Singapore. Obviously its super expensive and you won't getaway for less than $250/person - some (but not all of the price) is accounted for in the produce being air flown from Tsukiji. (If you want something that is great, but less expensive, try Tatsuya at Goodwood Park Hotel where you will start around $150/person). The dishes served at Shinji are more traditional sushi and maki dishes (you won't get many torched sushi dishes). In terms of execution it was all top notch and there were no flaws whatsoever in the sushi rice, the freshness of the fish or service.Service: Excellent. Ambiance: Traditional Japanese setting - mainly counter seating (which is my favourite anyway so you can chat with the chefs about what is in season). There are 2 or 3 little private rooms I think."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",wow japanese is great!,1,50,14-Aug-12,This restaurant is expensive but food very good. We go for birthday night and enjoy alot. The tuna and ebi prawns very fresh and sushi very nice. I want to go again but very expensive.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,1,40,28-Jul-12,"I went to Shinji this week as it was so well reviewed. The place has an elegant feel, with prompt service. I ordered a sushi platter and every item was good and tasty. Pricey, but to be expected."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi Place in Singapore,1,50,3-Jul-12,"Super fresh and yummy sashimi. The chef is very friendly and nice, very attentive. Service was fast. We order the omakaze. U will spend 500 more or less per person. Amazing experience....i went home super full that nite."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sashima you can find in!,1,50,1-Jul-12,Best value will be its weekday lunch. Fresh and delicious Japanese suitable for business entertainment
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",If you can't go to Hong Kong or Tokyo ...,1,40,1-Jul-12,"Shinji is certainly the best sushi in Singapore, easily surpasses Aoki. Is it worth it? That depends, if you really want very good sushi, and are stuck in Singapore, then paying SGD 500 per person (including sake) is the only thing to do. What is unfortunate is that it does really measure up on a regional scale. Of course, it is more expensive and no where as good as the places in Japan. But, what about Hong Kong? I frequently dine at Sushi Shin in Hong Kong and find it to be slightly less expensive, and far better than Shinji. Recently, I was in Tokyo (ate at Kyubei), Hong Kong (ate at Sushi Shin) and Singapore (ate at Shinji) all within a month. Over such a short period, it was easy for me to compare, and while Shinji was the most expensive of the three, it was also the worst."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A delightful Japanese experience.,1,50,28-Jun-12,"I've been to Hokkaido and tried several accomplished restaurants there and Shinji's food is about the best sushi you can get in Singapore. The food is served with very little seasoning as it is really fresh. Moreover, the chef will add a subtle twist to the sashimi and the whole experience for that dish will be enhanced tremendously. The chef also brings in seasonal food and changes his menu regularly. In addition, they have a list of really good Sake that goes very well with the food. To top it all, it was really a personal experience with the chef serving the food with a lot of attention and humour."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best sushi in Singapore, but outrageously expensive",1,50,3-Jun-12,"Having lived in Tokyo for eight years, there are few things I dream of more often than finding great sushi outside of Japan. For Singapore this is it. Unfortunately you feel like you are selling your soul to the devil every time you dine. Its about 75%+ more expensive than comparable quality in Japan. But what to do?"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Business Lunch - superb!,1,50,24-May-12,"Amazing sushi! We lived in Japan for 3.5 years and this is the best sushi I have had outside of Japan. Conveniently located in the Raffles Hotel. The set menu is amazing, its expensive, but it actually worth it with the quality of the sushi and the experience overall. I tend to go at lunchtime which makes it a little more affordable"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",best sushi/sashimi ex japan,1,50,19-May-12,simply the best I've had outside Japan. a massive wallet destroying exercise but umami to the max.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Probably the best Sushi in singapore but far from 3 starts in Tokyo,1,40,29-Apr-12,"I had $450 SGD course and the food there is quite palatable. However, after tasting Star sushi places in Tokyo, I found the quality vs. price is not the best. You can go to good Sushi places and eat fatty tuna or Oh toro anywhere but you can find the real delicacy of sushi not necessarily from the material they use but how they cook the fish (with vinegar, sugar or sometimes steaming sea eel). Overall I guess I cant complain considering that everything has to be imported from Tsukiji and the price gets higher."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",SUPER,1,50,13-Apr-12,"excellent sushi. I was amazed for sushi to be so good. but in my humble opinion, the price is way too high. almost $400 with plum wines. but then again, the wines are really really good! If you are going to stay at Raffles Hotel, this is the BEST OF BEST OF BEST SUSHI in singapore. 5-star!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ginza sushi without having to fly,1,50,5-Apr-12,The food is most definitely worth the hefty price. This place (out of all the Japanese restaurants in Singapore!) is the place we'll go to when we're craving good Japanese sushi and we are never disappointed by the chef's creations.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite sushi- feels like I'm in Japan!,1,40,30-Mar-12,"Exquisite, small and delicate sushi assortment freshly made by the Japanese chefExcellent taste! They taste even better than they look.:)Charming and humorous chef!

Oishi!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese in Singapore - complete dining experience!,1,50,15-Feb-12,"This has got to be my favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore!I have eaten there about 5 times in 2011 (3 times for lunch, twice for dinner) and have never been disappointed - the service and quality of the food is always consistently mind-blowing.Run jointly by Joni Ong & Oishi-san, hospitality is at its very best, with Oishi-san's Japanese take on hospitality and Joni's candid, unaffected & warm demeanour.My family and I have always felt very much welcome there.Counter seating - and usually packed over lunch hours - be sure to make a reservation in advance! Some would complain of the lack of privacy since it's a rather communal seating arrangement, but I myself have found it to be quite an experience in itself, and extremely authentic. :)If it's your first time there, be sure to1. Make a reservation2. Ask for Oishi-san to serve you3. Opt for the basic set for lunch (I always go for the 9 pc set, being petite and constantly on a diet, I can barely finish the 7th piece - or the slightly more premium one, when my paycheck's come in)4. Make sure you have 2-3 hours, with someone you deeply care about so you can slowly enjoy each dish, banter with the sushi chef and drink some sake with your loved one.The sushi melts in your mouth, is so fresh you half expect the fish slices to perform a little musical and dance around on its rice ball. <3<3<3 worth every penny. (even though it's a hell of a lot of pennies you're paying!)For lunch I tend to get away with paying $150-200 per head while for dinner it's about $350-400 with Sake, per head."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Ultimate sushi experience,1,50,29-Jan-12,"This is a pricey place, so do not gow if 300S$++ per person will make you feel unconfortable. But if you can afford it and if you want to experience something extraordinery make sure to visit Shinji.The two hours I have spend there count among the most exciting and amusing time I have ever experieced during dinner. Can't wait to return."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Again and again,1,40,31-Dec-11,"Never disappointed.
Been here several times, service check. Food double check. Ambience check.
What more can I ask for?:)"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase the way I like it,1,50,4-Dec-11,"Omakase roughly translates to ""chef's recommendation"". @ Shinji, you get to choose the chef you want to serve you. The sashimi is always fresh...and sometimes, the chef will share a joke with you. (I particularly find one chef really cute! :) ) My fave at Shinji is the uni (sea urchin) which can be served in so many ways...whatever the chef deems the best way to serve it. Sometimes, it's in season and you'll have a range of choices. There are different omakase sets to choose from and I usually go for the $250 set menu (excluding taxes and service charge). The lunch set starts from $75. I have yet to try the dinner omakase set. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore,1,50,29-Nov-11,"Pros
(1)Best sushi in Singapore by far. Another sushi will taste like crap after you try this.
(2) Excellent service.
Cons
(1) Counter tables so not much privacy
(2) Expensive"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth it - highest quality sushi & excellent service,1,50,16-Nov-11,"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. If you are a sushi connoisseur, this is a must. They only serve the highest quality sushi - the fish is flown in from Japan 5 times per week. They have an excellent selection of sake by the bottle & carafe. Service is faultless and decor is simple, aesthetically pleasing and very Japanese. It is very expensive, but absolutely worth it."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in Singapore!,1,50,29-Sep-11,"Shinji is without a doubt the best Restaurant in Singapore! Set in the historical Raffles Hotel you are made to feel like Royality as soon as you enter the restaurant.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best experience in Japanese restaurant,1,50,20-Sep-11,"This was my second visit to Shinji. First time was Jan 2011.The food quality was maintained at its highest standard.Dinner only have 3 menu aside from that so long as you can name it and they have the ingredient, they will custom made for you. Especially for my small children.I still remember when we first stepped into Shinji main entrance, the waitress asked us ""Do you have reservation?"" We said no. She said, ""Sorry our Sushi counter is full!"" Funny... In Malaysia we always reserves for private room but why in Shinji the regulars only book their Sushi counter?This trip we booked our Sushi counter seats and realized that it was a great enjoyment having dinner at the Sushi counter!We enjoyed watching the Sushi master, Kokuchi San who has 14 years of preparing Sushi and Sashimi experience in Tokyo, Osaka and Indonesia, prepared our food and it was an art... So amazing.Mr. Kokuchi not only explained to us why certain fish or seafood had to prepared in particular ways, he also shared his life experience with us. We were like having dinner in an old friend's house, exchanging our experiences.Only thing I have to highlight that is if you choose to dine in Shinji, don't expect you can have high quality food with cheap or reasonable prices. They are real expansive!It is very very expansive compare to what we can have in Malaysia.It cost us about RM4000 for a dinner of 4 adults and 2 children.BUT it is a life time experience. You shall never miss it if you are affordable.We sure will return to Shinji if we travel to Singapore again.Thank you Kokuchi San for making super mini tamago sushi for my daughter and super mini tamago hand rolls for my son."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Second mortgage prices...,1,40,12-Sep-11,"...on the other hand probably among the top five Japanese meals I've ever had, and certainly the best in Singapore.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",To die for...,1,50,12-Apr-11,"I was lucky enough to dine at Shinji by Kanesaka last night and it was incredible. If you're in any doubt as to whether to go there, just do it. It's not cheap but hey, this is Singapore. The food was stunning - I just wish I could dine here every night. I lived in Japan for 5 years and this was on a par with the best sushi that Japan has to offer. The chef was just gorgeous and so accommodating. The only downside (and a very minor one at that) was that not all of the wait staff were Japanese. But I am really splitting hairs to find something to complain about. One of the best meals I have ever eaten..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great time, but be prepared to fork out $$$",1,50,3-Oct-18,"Great time to celebrate with my partner. We booked 1 month in advance, and need to secure the booking with a credit card guarantee.We had the degustation menu of 10 courses, and a bottle of sake. No complaint of the food, all dishes were memorable, especially the uni dish and wagyu beef.The restaurant had 2 seating timing, and we were informed that second timing was full on that day - but the restaurant kept the number of diner to a minimum of 10-12 pax per seating."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Experience the bar as a starter,1,40,24-Sep-18,"I had planned to head to Gluttons Bay market for a chilli crab, only to be severely disappointed by the running of the Singapore Grand Prix and therefore unable to access it. I was aware that Marina Bay Sands nearby hosted some celebrity restaurants, and I had heard of Tetsuya's Waku Ghin, so changed my plans to go there. I wasn't particularly dressed for the occasion, however the staff greeted me with no difference, and I was promptly seated to access the bar menu (the degustation that day was $450, and a bit out of my budget). I had the most amazing umekomachi as a cocktail, then an exceptional beef tartare that was perfectly mixed with wasabi soy with fine egg topping, then a toro bowl where the fish was exceptional but the rice was a bit gluggy and underwhelming. Overall a very good experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",If you want Michelin Star food in Singapore thats different then this is a MUST GO,1,50,23-Aug-18,"My wife & I are on honeymoon,having got married after living together for over 35 years, so we wanted something different and we certainly found it at Waku Ghin , Top quality 2 star Michelin quality food that was very different to the majority of Michelin star restaurants , top ingredients that had been imported from all around the world & turned into a magical theatre of dishes.Their signature dish Sea Urchin was amazing ! All staff were so professional and attentive especially Kimme .We had the 10 course tasting menu, with wine pairing, very expensive but worth every penny because food & wine were TOP OF THE WORLD"

Waku Ghin reminds us all of how food should be enjoyed and savoured. Simply exquisite!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A good preview at The Bar,1,40,11-Aug-18,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit at The Bar at Waku Ghin, with a more casual dinner setting and delicious cocktails. The grilled vegetables with anchovy sauce was simple but well prepared. I also enjoyed the trout and the wagyu steak. Dessert choices were beautifully presented on a tray and we ended up with the chocolate cake. Service was warm and friendly, they even gave me the cocktail recipe of the ""sake-margarita"" that I really liked."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Pricey, but worth it!",1,50,19-Jul-18,"Delicious seafood and great service, but for me the wagyu was really the star of the show! It is 10 courses and then some delicious desserts. Pricey, but definitely worth it,especially if you have only been to this caliber of restaurant in the US and Europe."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Overall an interesting experience,1,40,15-Jul-18,"Service was excellent with explanation as to what we were eating. The executive chef checked if the three guys at our table were full near the end of the meal and recommended beef rice which was more filling than the alternative pasta with tomato and soba. There were two birthday guests and the strawberry shortcake to celebrate our birthdays was light and not too sweet. The reason I picked very good and not excellent is because unlike a 2 star in Tokyo where every dish surprised me and was exquisite, here it was a mix of exquisite/really good and OK, so so. The mackerel tataki was OK as were the wagyu and cold soba. However, the cold pasta with tomato and basil was really refreshing, the Bouillabaisse (stew with scallop, lobster, crab etc) was delicious and went very well with the very light bread that accompanied it, and the soft poached egg with truffle and caviar was a lovely mix of texture and taste. The signature dish, the shrimp with sea urchin and caviar was a good mix in terms of sweetness (from the shrimp) and saltiness (from the caviar)."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",THE BEST,1,50,11-Jul-18,"The best food and the best experience too!!! The degustation menu was pricey but it's worth it! We were here for hubby's birthday and the staff was so nice, they printed a Happy Birthday on the paper menu and put a Happy Birthday on my husband's dessert!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dinner at a 2 Michelin Star Restaurant,1,50,8-Jul-18,"The food is European inspired Japanese cuisine. There are Japanese styled dish like their signature Marinated Botan Ebi with Uni and Oscietra Caviar. But with their Ghin Bouillabaisse, their use ingredients like white miso for the Bouillabaisse with Spanner Crab, Hokkaido Scallop, Nova Scotia Lobster and Kinmedai. The Kinmedai and Lobster was seared at low heat to change the texture of the flesh. The delicate way of cooking the ingredients displays simplicity and elegance.The service was impeccable and an overall great experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Gastronomic experience,1,40,2-Jul-18,"saved up this month to treat my family for a meal here. to be honest, i remembered the food to be better a few years back but it did not disappoint nonetheless. If you plan to visit waku ghin, i think its better not to have heavy/oily meals before hand."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite tastes,1,50,18-Jun-18,"From the minute you walk into the restaurant, you join a rarefied environment that makes you feel like you've left the world behind. If you're a previous customer, the staff knows what you've had previously and will present new menu items for your omakase dining. Yet some familiar favorites must be had - the Uni and botan shrimp with caviar is just heavenly. Definitely a place to impress the date but it's a going to cost a pretty penny."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An Amazing Dining Experience,1,50,28-May-18,"We had our own private room with our own private chef, so this was a very special evening. The chef brought out a box full of assorted fish and shell fish, all still moving around - can't get fresher than that. I can't decide whether the uni, abalone or the wagyu was the best dish of the night - everything was amazingly delicious! We ended up with about 13 dishes with wine pairing. For your foodies, can't recommend this place enough, a must do in Singapore!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Delightful experience ,1,50,26-May-18,"Was treated by my wife to a great meal here. We had the ten course degustation set, starting with the carpaccio of snapper with bitter salad, ice plant and Sudachi. This was parried with Billecart Salmon Champagne. The second course was the marinate Boston Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Osietra Urchin. This is the signature dish of the restaurant. It was paired with the Masuizumi Junmqi Daiginjo. Third course was pan seated fillet of Ayi with Daikon and Fennel, paired with Tengumaj GorinFourth course was the Tasmanian Abolone with Aonori, paired with Resling Domaine WeinbachFifth course was Braised Canadian lobster with Tarragon, paired 2016 Pierro Chardonnay Sixth course was charcoal grilled Tasmania beef with 2015 Meo-Camuzet MarsannaySeventh course was Japanese Ohmi Wagyu with Citrus soy, paired with Couvent Des Jacobins. Eighth course wa the framed rice with snapper and consommé, followed by Japanese tea. Desert was Japanese Mandarin GranitaOverall it wa a delightful meal"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",10-Oct,1,50,24-May-18,"This was our number one choice while visiting Singapore, it didn’t disappoint. We read reviews from others commenting on the price but I felt it was worth every penny. Fantastic having an interactive chef, food was delicious and the wine pairing was perfect. The head sommelier was amazing. We will definitely return if we visit Singapore again and I recommend this place to everyone."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fancy Dinning,1,50,14-May-18,The 8-10 course set meal at Waku Ghin is nothing short of phenomenal. The impeccable service and quality of food is worth every penny and definitely a great place to bring your loved ones for a wonderful celebration.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Gastronomic foodie experience ,1,50,25-Apr-18,"Been waiting to experience Waku Ghin for a while and boy did it not disappoint. By far the best food experience I’ve had in Singapore so far. The food was sublime and especially their signature dish of sea urchin. Absolutely heavenly! Although it’s quite pricey, it was worth every dollar. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great especially for celebration of special events,1,50,23-Apr-18,"We recently celebrated our daughter's 21st birthday here a few weeks ago. We had a private room to ourselves and Chef was very good in explaining ingredients used and style of cooking. We have been to Waku Ghin a few times and they have never disappointed. They have a few regular dishes including their specialty dish, which is always superb. Thouroughly enjoyed this birthday celebration dinner. Thanks for taking care of us."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Shortest Dinner At Best Food Quality Assured,1,50,20-Mar-18,"If You're In A Rush For Meeting , Theatre Or Something Else Dining At The Bar At Waku Ghin Definitely A Good Option Food Was Great Drink List Is Remarkable Most Importantly The Service"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb creativity and almost Perfect,1,40,21-Jan-18,"We came in a party of 6 for dinner and was seated in one of the four private rooms with a Teppanyaki table setting. Chef was very friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the 10 course meal and if we had to be very critical, we could only find fault with the lobster which we felt the broth was overly tasty that it might have overkilled the natural freshness and original taste of shellfish. Good recommendation for pairing with an excellent sake from Ishikawa Prefecture. The signature Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar was certainly two thumbs up.Services was also excellent except for a mixed up with the drinks. I think the creativity with Japanese (and also Australian) cuisines fusion were superb. Easily an Excellent rating restaurant but the prices charged probably doesn't allow any room for minor let-down."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Food and serice flawless, world class restaurant, one glitch that almost ruined it",1,40,16-Jan-18,"Waku Ghin has delivered all the way on food and service. I made a mistake on the date of the reservation on my calendar and the day before I thought I had a reservation they called me and asked me where I was. Totally my fault, they changed my reservation to the next day, great service.I had the tasting menu (like everybody else) with wine pairing and the food was simply out of this world. My favorite was the Uni and the beef, just amazing. Every dish was masterfully prepared by the chef right there, he answered all my questions but was also very non-intrusive. The service was outstanding... However there was the room next to us with a group of five, yelling and screaming the entire time (except for the smoking breaks they took). It was so loud I had trouble hearing the chef in front of me. I kept complaining and I get the idea that it I hard to compromise between paying customers. The couple next to me moved to the main dining room because it was to loud. I see what the problem I, dealing with an obviously drunk group, however my experience was almost ruined.Waku Ghin is expensive, and the experience should be perfect, that is why I gave them only a very good rating.Dessert is served in the main dining room with a view of the light and water show."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Truly amazing , Dining at its finest.",1,50,13-Jan-18,"Totally outstanding food , a true experience. Dining at its finest. if you want fine dining Japanese style, this is the place.
Jaw dropping seafood , in such creative ways."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hands-down the best uni dish ever,1,40,27-Dec-17,"Waku Ghin is located within the Marina Bay Sands complex, a massive structure comprised of a hotel, casino, high-end shopping and celebrity chef restaurants. Waku Ghin is the child of Japanese-Australian Chef Testuya Wakuda, whose Sydney-based restaurant has been one of our favourites. Conceptually, Waku Ghin is a semi private dining experience where food is served counter style in several small rooms, ranging in capacity from four to eight diners. There is a fixed price ten course menu that features luxurious seasonal ingredients. The final two courses are served in a larger dining lounge where one can overlook the 8 pm light show that takes place at the adjacent lagoon. This also allows the restaurant more flexibility for their second dinner seating. Now to the food: In generally, the dining experience did not disappoint. The meal started out with tuna belly sashimi, followed by Waku Ghin’s signature dish – uni served in a sea urchin shell with Botan shrimp sashimi and caviar. Heaven in a sea urchin exoskeleton! The third course was also a highlight – perfectly cooked filet of Tachiuo with foie gras and Okinawa spinach served in dashi – a deadly combination. The next three courses were a little bit less successful: the seared Hokkaido scallop was a little on the tough side, albeit tasty, the char grilled spayed open Carabinero shrimp was on the dry side, and the poached lobster could have been more tender (the claw was delicious, but the tail was somewhat chewy). This was made up for by a stunning Wagyu beef dish that melted on the palate, followed by a rice bowl with grilled Wagyu which was quite delicious also. Dessert consisted primarily of a chocolate mousse cake – it tasted good, but came across as short on creativity. Service was impeccable, and the wine list was large and ranged from reasonably priced wines to a 58,000 $ bottle of something that I can’t remember and would never order, even if I had the cash.Altogether, we had a lovely evening at Waku Ghin. I would rate the food somewhere between four or five stars, but given the price of the meal at close to 500 $ Can per person, one should reasonably be able to expect perfection – and perfect it was not."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Breathtaking and Inventive,1,50,29-Nov-17,"Went to Waku Ghin on first time visit to Singapore, persuaded in part by TripAdvisor reviews. Were not disappointed. This place is VERY expensive (e.g. more than Alinea in Chicago!), and situated above a large casino in the flashy Marina Bay Sands complex- never a good sign.Nevertheless, the meal soared above expectations, the best Japanese cuisine we've ever experienced (note: never visited Japan itself). Among the standout items:1) the signature dish (pictured), a savory medley of tender raw shrimp, succulent, sweet uni and caviar. To die for delicious2) the abalone, steamed on the griddle on a bed of sea salt (!), and covered with lemon slices and seaweed, then served in its shell with a savory seaweed sauce- earthy, complex and delicate flavor.3) the lobster, slow cooked in a delicious spicy Asian sauce4) tiny chocolate mousse cake, with a tiny garland of gold leaf, intense, tart and sweet.The young chef who cooked our seafood, in a small private room shared with two other couples, was friendly, skillful, gracious and humble. The service was exceptional, not overbearing, but attentive and thoughtful. We had an amazing meal at Waku Ghin and recommend to Singapore travelers without hesitation. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive but so worth it,1,50,12-Nov-17,This is definitely a bucket list experience. You feel like royalty from the moment you check in and the evening just keeps getting better as the night wears on. The food is incredible and the staff really help keep the drama alive - making time to show you the fresh produce and describe it and allow time for photos. We also added in the matching wines and we are so glad that we did - it just completed the experience beautifully. The completion of the meal in another area of the restaurant was a gorgeous finale.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A totally different experience,1,50,6-Nov-17,"Visited the bar and had a la carte menu. It was a totally different experience! You cannot have this great Japanese cuisine even if your are in Japan. The service was perfect! At the end, we had beautiful desserts like gems. Certainly I will try what they have at the main table next time in the near future. Worth visiting Singapore for only having dinner here."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best restaurant in Singapore,1,50,30-Oct-17,"The standard of the food offering here is exceptional. It is a set menu which ranges across seafood. The meals are prepared in front of you. The wine list is very good. The service is excellent.
There is no better place to eat in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Worth it ,1,50,23-Oct-17,"This visit was in the making for quite a few years and it did not disappoint. Over four hours, we were taken through a food journey like no other. It was not just about the food, but the making memory that was formed. We were all treated to food, drinks and service of the highest quality. I would find it hard to top this experience and would recommend it if you were planning an unforgettable night."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A lovely meal ,1,40,14-Oct-17,"We decided to splurge on Waku Gin with a family member one Friday evening. Being from Sydney and having all eaten at Tetsuya, we were interested to see whether the S$400+++ per person menu was worth it. The restaurant is located in the celebrity dining area above the casino. Waku Gin is nothing like Tetsuya. The restaurant only seats a small number of guests at each of the two sittings each night in rooms of approximately five. When we arrived (prior to any other guests) we were escorted to an area where we could have a pre dinner drink. We were then shown into our room where we were served our first eight courses. The guests at the earlier sitting were a mainly tourists from Asia but there were a few more local guests. The staff firstly showed us a box of examples of the type of seafood we would be eating. Most of the menu is seafood with two beef courses. The seafood came from around the world including Canada. We were then served some entrees including sashimi and their specialty uni and caviar dish. The chefs then started to cook in front of us the various seafood dishes which included braised lobster, abalone, and fish. We also then had two courses of beef (one Australian and one Japanese wagyu beef), rice soup with snapper, then moved to the main dining room for dessert. Dessert included cake and petit fours. Overall the service was very attentive and polite. The food was very fresh - the freshness of the food was the real attraction. However the restaurant felt a bit cold and soulless ... maybe because of the layout and being quite dark. It was a nice experience however we were honestly a bit disappointed that it wasn't a bit more special and distinctive. Being so expensive in Singapore, we had expected better. The restaurant seemed to lack somewhat a bit of personality. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great as usual, but stale bread!?",1,40,7-Oct-17,"We came here again with family who were in town. The menu changes by the season and the choices were interesting, though we were happy the singature dish of uni was still the same. There was a lobster bisque-like dish which was delicious and I wanted to soak up the last bits with a bit of bread, but the bread was stale and rubbery. I couldn't believe it. I love this restaurant but I was really disappointed by the stale bread, simple thing but at this price point everything should be great and this was a big fail for me. Otherwise the rest was great and the sommelier was excellent, but since our first visit two years ago, I feel the quality has declined just a bit."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The best restaurant in the world,1,50,6-Sep-17,We went to this restaurant not long after it had opened. While it is expensive it is the most amazing dining experience we have ever had. Food was totally different from most other restaurants but absolutely beautifully presented and had the best flavour ever.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Thoroughly satisfying meal,1,50,19-Aug-17,"From the start - cocktails, to the end - dessert, I was amazed by the amazing service, the freshness of ingredients, the ambiance and creativity. Take my money! Will be back here again"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japan on a plate,1,50,15-Aug-17,"Although we only walked in for the bar dinner rather than the restaurant dinner, we were treated as special guests.Food and wine are fabulous and the wagu beef amazing.We were fortunate that Tetsuya the owner was there and he generously spent some time with us. Next trip will definitely be the full experience. Decor was amazing with wonderful pottery from an Australian artist on display. Truly deserving of the Michelin award."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Higher State of Consciousness,1,50,6-Aug-17,"The online thesaurus has 38 synonyms for Delicious, 44 for Remarkable ... I'm going to have try hard not to use them all in this review. This is 6 star dining in city spoilt with 5 star food.The menu is fixed, with seasonal updates occurring around an iconic heart of signature dishes.As an example, the Marinated prawn, sea urchin and caviar is nothing short of perfection. Sitting at the 8 seater teppanyaki counter those who had never tasted it sighed in surprise and delight, while those who'd enjoyed the pleasure before looked at their friends and cheered in delight, wistfully remembering the ecstasy of their own first time.Having been twice now, the impact of such a light but flavorful, richly salted, sweet and sour balanced dish isn't lost, even a note, the second time. I've not eaten a seafood dish as good in my life.This is a statement I must have made 5 or 6 times on my first visit no meter the dish - vegetables, rice and beef. A charming young sommelier guided us through the world of sake, and after a fascinating beginners introduction we settled on one of the houses own sakes, created in partnership with an artisanal brewer in Japan. This was delicious and much like a good wine with European cuisine, enhanced our meal even further.The dishes flow like ambrosia. One plate of perfection after the next. Strangers sitting along the counter all now firm friends, bonded through whimpers of pure pleasure.As dinner finished and we praised our chef, we were led to a lounge for desert. Delicate chocolates, a light aperitif, and a slice of the best melon I've ever had! I know this sounds ridiculous, but in a menu that consisted of the mind blowing and better, this humble melon deserves a mention. It just goes to show that a manic obsession with sourcing, respecting and preparing the very best can transcend food to heavenly places.Your going to pay handsomely for this euphoric meal, and it is worth every single penny. You'll leave feeling like something has changed in your life, something wonderful and for the better. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique dinning, would do it again!",1,50,3-Aug-17,"I've been eyeing this restaurant for so long from IG posts. When I had a chance to visit Singapore I booked one month in advance to secure my spot. I went solo as none of my friends were able to justify the price. In my opinion, you live once, you have to try it! The dinning experience was so unique, this is my first time in a very fine dinning restaurant and I must admit I was not sure what to expect but I know that it should be worth the money! Service was impeccable and the food was, unique and of great quality, everything was so delightful from start to finish! I love the privacy of the experience, I was with 2 other couples and really like the interaction of the chef cooking in front of you and the waitress that seems to pop out of no where whenever you need refill, serving and when you finish your dishes. I hardly have to lift a finger, only there to eat, eat and eat!! I would actually do it again in the future if I had a chance to go back to Singapore, just hope their menu change daily as I wouldn't want to go back to eat the exact same thing again, this is of course due to the price of the set menu. Though their signature Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar can stay!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent!,1,50,29-Jul-17,"Waku Ghin is a must visit for any serious foodie. A very enjoyable dinner with the freshest produce and excellent service. Especially enjoyed the botan shrimp with sea urchin, the restaurant's speciality. I've had the privilege of meeting Chef Tetsuya at another function and he is by far one of the warmest and most humble celebrity chef I've met. Kudos to him for flying his flag high in Singapore! "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The BEST on our 12-Michelin Star Trip!,1,50,17-May-17,"We are foodies and just completed a trip to Singapore and HongKong with a combined 12 Michelin stars. Waku Ghin for us was the most pleasing experience overall - and we had a lot of fun on our trip! What was so outstanding about it?- it's like having a personal chef prepare your meal right in front of you, interact with you, and explain interesting tidbits - outstanding dishes!! I agree with the other TA reviews - the Uni, Shrimp, and Caviar (lots of Caviar) signature dish just blows the taste buds into heaven! The abalone was just amazing (and I am not usually a fan);- Sake & wine pairing; we are picky with our wines after some other eateries' tasting menus we're trying to be too smart by half; but the sommelier perfectly adjusted the wine selection and we tried 3 deep Sake tastes; and 3 wines plus champagne. Generous portions. Well paired!!- a huge amount of food AND Sake/wine ... actually it was too much food quantity for my spouse, and left even me trying to find more space in my stomach- a serene interplay between the bar, culinary, experience, and architecture. They really thought this through. The one downer: when leaving after a fabulously satisfying evening, the door of Waku Ghin lets you out on a balcony overlooking a gigantic casino - that was an unfortunate counterpointAll in all, Waku Ghin beat out other, more highly rated establishments in our experience. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional Precision in Cullinary Art,1,50,5-Apr-17,"Simply outstanding.
An incredible experience, the best restaurant we have dined in and that includes 2 & 3 Star Michelin."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Faultless,1,50,1-Apr-17,From entry to exit the service were impeccable. One of the best dining experiences ever! Best dish was definitely their signature sea urchin dish! Price tag of over $500 per person means its definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Looking forward to trying out Tetsuya's in Sydney.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in a life time experience,1,50,28-Mar-17,"Not sure what to write, this is a culinary experience on a whole different level! All the dishes are prepared in front of you in a private room, so no distractions from other tables.
A must go for any serious food lover!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Wonderful for special occasions,1,50,26-Mar-17,"Very personal service. SGD450++ tasting menu is the best I've ever had & worth every dollar. Very beautiful presentation & extremely tasty dishes. Had wine and sake pairing at SGD250++ which covers 8 different types. Loved the sake, didn't fancy the whites so much and liked 1 of the 2 reds, but all personal preferences. Extremely good desserts as well! Deserves Michelin Star! "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",I prefer Tetsuya's in Sydney,1,40,18-Mar-17,"""They say better say nothing if you don't have something nice to say.""Well I would like to say that Waku Ghin was a lovely experience. In that the food and service were impeccable. My objection is with a few others things though. The food with matching wine was $700pp so that was what I thought we would be paying at the very most - I was wrong. We were asked if we wanted a pre dinner drink before being asked if we wanted the matching wine option - a bit naughty considering that my husband and I both ordered a glass of champagne (which I think we were charged close to $100 per glass). Secondly they offered a truffle dish in addition to what they had on the menu, that too was approximately $100. Finally there was an expectation for a tip to be given - not happy about that either. We ended up forking out $1,800 for 2 for one very special night out. It was good - but my advice would be if you are inclined spend that sort of money fly to Sydney and eat at his restaurant there. So much better in every which way imaginable. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A unique culinary journey,1,50,11-Mar-17,Everything was just so perfect .. from the meet and greet all the way to the farewell .. and of course the Japanese cuisine at another level all together .. a unique experience like no other .. guaranteed ..
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb!,1,50,12-Feb-17,"Let's be honest - Waku Ghin is an expensive restaurant! But if you can afford it, I would recommend to go. It has a set menu and you can pay extra to get dishes with truffles. You will sit in a chef table and food will be made and prepared in front of your eyes. Which I always love to see as it's such a fine art in my opinion. We didn't order any wine there as we wanted to try some good sake, as its a fine Japanese restaurant. The sommelier recommended one sake and we loved it - one of the best we've ever tried!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular!,1,50,7-Jan-17,"The setting, level 2 of the ultra posh Marina Bay Sands mall and casino, is understated, chic elegance. As you approach the doors two attendants open them and bid you into a dark, slick bat/ lounge area where if you've arrived ahead of that pointed time for one of the two set mealtimes, you can indulge in incredible cocktail or mock tail and if tempted try a French oyster or two. Advice: do the cocktail and defer on the oyster... over the next three hours or so you are going to eat some of the finest (Japanese) or otherwise food on the planet.You sit in a private room at a Omakase style bar with just six people. Your chef starts with a presentation of the raw seafood ( the Canadian lobsters we're still moving) that will be incorporated into your meal... don't worry there will alsobemear courses: in our case Ohmi Wagyu and Tasmanian Grass fed beef. Do opt for a sake to accompany your meal....it's a rare selection that you won't find anywhere else. Our dinner consisted of 9 courses including abalone and marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and Oscietra caviar. Terrific selection of wines available by the glass or bottle. Once dinner is complete you move to a lounge overlooking the harbor for light dessert and beverage of your choice. Amazing desserts!It is not cheap, but from start to finish you are treated as royalty and most likely eat better than most royals. DO make an advance reservation, and unless you are a night owl, the 5:30 seating is ideal. We left at 9:00!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good Atmosphere!,1,50,28-Dec-16,"I would recommend if celebrating any occasion with loved ones, this is quite a place to consider but price is really high, service is good though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing food,1,50,28-Dec-16,"It was a special occasion for us and so we splurged on this evening - 9-course dinner with 3 other desserts. Every dish was fantastic. Needless to say, their signature dish of sea urchin, caviar and shrimp was perfectly balanced and fresh. But for me, the best dish was the grilled abalone. I have never had abalone like that, and it was perfectly cooked. I don't want to comment on every single dish. But two general comments. (1) The sauces that they made to match every course were creative and amazing. (2) The attention to detail and the ""show"" part of cooking was memorable. Our chef was a young man but so well-trained and knowledgeable that it was a great conversation the whole meal through. It is hard for me to imagine how this place cannot earn at least 2 Michelen stars. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An experience,1,40,14-Dec-16,"It was a treat to dine at Waku Ghin given its rave reviews and the overall experience was memorable. The quality of the food and produce was first rate- lobster, sea urchin, caviar, wagyu and abalone. The best dish was undoubtedly the botan shrimp with caviar- a unique creation bursting with umami and very refreshing. The abalone however didn't quite cut it, tasting rather bland and falling short in texture. I very much preferred the accompaniment to the abalone as opposed to the abalone itself. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth checking out. On another note, it was a pleasure meeting with Chef Tetsuya at Savour. One of the humblest and nicest chefs I'ce met despite his fame. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional meal,1,50,11-Dec-16,"This restaurant is a bit hard to find but if you do, this will be one of the best experience of your life. Enjoyed a 10-course dinner. We had a table in front of the cooking plate and could observe how meticulous and professional they are. All dishes were absolutely delicious and what was striking was the quality of their products: as fresh as if it has just come out of the water. Great wine, great sake, one of the best meals ever in my life. Very expensive though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but an experience,1,50,4-Dec-16,The variety of dishes offered by the place is phenomenal. Every restaurant should learn how the food should be cooked and served. The good things come at a price so be ready to sacrifice your wallet there :-)
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but Fantastic,1,50,8-Nov-16,"There is a tendency with expensive, top flight restaurants for snobby reviewers to pretend the food is only so-so. No question it is expensive, too expensive in comparison to some other meals we've spent $1k and above on (Atelier Crenn and E by Andres come to mind immediately), but several of the dishes were phenomenal. The cost, I'm certain, is due to the quality of the ingredients, none of which come cheap.With 10 courses, we passed on the wine pairing, which we almost never do, but we worried about the noted 8 pours in 10 courses, and they wouldn't let us share a tasting. We opted for two glasses each, and all the by the glass choices were high quality, among the best in the world.1) Hanadai - fantastic sushi dish to start off the tasting.2) Waku Ghin's signature dish - marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Hard to go wrong with these ingredients, and it was as good as advertised.3) Seared amadai w/mushrooms, another solid dish.4) Special - it's white truffle season! A generous portion (to match the sky high price) of white alba truffles went over a potato puree with a poached egg and caviar. The highlight of the evening for both my wife and I.5) Steamed king crab - great show, steamed over a mound of salt, with a lime sauce that created the best crab dish I've ever had.6) Abalone - this was the one miss. The abalone at French Laundry was unbelievable - best I've ever had, and Waku Ghin's was tough and unpleasant - a disappointing dish.7) Lobster - braised slowly in front of us while the previous two dishes were cooked. Very tasty, but not as flavorful as I expected.8) Wagyu w/wasabi. With these ingredients, you can't go wrong, and it was phenomenal.9) Steamed rice consommé - an incredibly elevated play on miso soup - a highlight for me.10) Traditional japanese green tea - a very pleasant end to the savory courses.11) Honey ice cream w/lemon granita, very tasty.12) my wife got what she said was the best rice pudding she's ever had, and my chocolate mousse was solid.Overall, a phenomenal meal in a fun teppan setting. It's hard to meet sky high expectations, but while I'd like the price to have been less, the crab, sea urchin, and wagyu were world class dishes."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointment ,1,40,6-Nov-16,"Went to Waku Ghin with high expectations. With the dinner menu priced at $450++ and wines being heavily marked up, you are going to spend at least $1.5K for a couple, so naturally you would expect a wow. But it was not the case, as the majority of the food courses were decent but not outstanding. Service was superb and almost impeccable, except that the upselling efforts by the staff were on the heavy side. Ambiance is pleasant. Decor is first class. Wine list is excellent. Conclusion. Waku Ghin has failed to impress us: indeed it is a decent establishment, but there is a number of restaurants in Singapore offering even better food while being much more affordable."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",ORDO AB CHAO,1,50,28-Oct-16,"Each course and its matched wine was a building crescendo of taste fantasies. on reflection, there were personal preferences - different for each patron - but the pathway remained as tantalising as the crumb chase of Hansel and Gretel , until the very last vestige.As good as the best - anywhere."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite dining,1,50,19-Oct-16,"We dined here as a couple and everything was just perfect. I loved the intimacy of just two couples in the room watching the chef work his magic. The 10 dishes were fantastic, particularly the marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Great ambiance and really just fine dining at its best. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","A unique service & experience, decadent menu but perfect execution",1,50,18-Oct-16,"I was dying for a gastronomic dinner after a dry period of the last few months and some poor restaurant experiences. So I was really looking forward to this and it did not let me down. The menu was as decadent as it can be. From caviar, foie gras, uni, scallop, abalone, fatty tuna, A5 Wagyu and several other usual suspects to the introduction of new ingredients I had never come across before like sea grass, large botan shrimp etc this menu was a compliation of the biggest hits in the food world. I have had a similar experience in Robuchon before but whereas Robuchon was more show-off style and not much good mix of flavours, at Waku Ghin everything was like a journey of flavours and each distinct to each other. The staff were great with attention to detail and style of service. Can only expect this from a Japanese chef. I dont know how they do it but its heartwarming experience. Bravo, needless to say I would only recommend this to whoever can afford it. Its is $660 per person including a couple of drinks."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakaze in Spore,1,50,15-Oct-16,"The omakaze here is excellent, it's fixed set menu and the portions will blow your stomach away. Food is fresh, the signature dish is the uni with shrimps. I personally like the lobster bisque kind of dish and the beef as well. I can't describe anymore how good the dishes are until you try it. Reservation is a must and if you have to book weeks in advance with credit card being charged first, it's very normal. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Recommended,1,40,20-Sep-16,"Great ambience, great food, great service...... Except for that price, I could get much more than what I get in many Japanese restaurants in Japan.
It is still recommended as it is one of the better Japanese restaurants in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in Singapore ,1,50,27-Aug-16,Food is just out of this world. Thoughtful and skilful use of condiments and garnishes to bring out the flavours in the freshest ingredients - makes you realise great food is just that simple. Impeccable service and one of the widest selection of sake just adds on to the whole wonderful dining experience. Definitely worth more than the one star it's been given by Michelin.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A perfect experience,1,50,30-Jul-16,"We had the incredible privilege of having a private chef in a private room, and the dinner was a delight from start to end."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Premium (and fresh) ingredients,1,40,30-Jul-16,"Enjoyed our dinner at Waku Ghin. Started at 530pm and ended just before 8. Food gets served pretty quickly which was even better for me since I get reallyimpatient waiting. Don't think that they are too strict with dress code as the couple next to us wore tshirt, jeans and sneakers. Very meticulous team, they give you a copy of their menu after your meal and I was very surprised that they edited the title of my second dish (I'm allergic to raw crustaceans so I didn't have raw shrimps with my uni). They charge a bit differently for water, instead of charging per bottle they go by $20 per person for still water (so drink more guys haha)! In terms of taste, above average, but I'm giving the experience 4/5 as the price of the meal was on par with the ingredients used (uni, tuna, king crab, lobster, abalone, wagyu) - very worth it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely stunning,1,50,26-Jul-16,"This is what food should be all about. No fancy cooking, just pure, fresh ingredients with the clever use of condiments and garnishes to bring out or enhance the flavours. The selection of sake is also second to none. You just get the impression that the owner and everybody who works here knows food, knows what they're doing and are passionate about it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Restaurant Review,1,50,22-Jul-16,"Amazing restaurant. The food is very delicious. At the end, they give you a paper where it shows everything that we have ate. The service is very nice and friendly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Little modern Tokyo,1,50,15-Jul-16,Tepanyaki style in MBS. Always pleasure to come back and never feel like being in the casino as you got into the restaurant. Very cozy and well received. Food for each courses were delicate with the young chef and even its not as good as the authentic one in Japan but it's another great place to visit. Good selection of Sake and wine lists but too much mark up on wine lists. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Just when you think you had seen it all!,1,50,14-Jul-16,"A truly unique dining experience. This restaurant has it all. Classy yet sobre interior decor. Fantastic service. Sublime food.Great desert room with Armagnacs by Darroze made specially for the restaurant and chef Tetsuya and depending on your timing, a front seat to the great MBS laser light show on every evening! From the moment you walk in you are taken care of and subjected to the Waku Ghin experience which is, to say the least, amazing and wonderful. They serve a 10 course tasting menu with emphasis on seafood. This is the most special of ""special places"" and was one of my most (if not THE most) memorable dining experiences. If you pocketbook can afford it (perfection does not come cheap!) it is money well spent for a special experience. Thank you to the entire Wahu Ghin team for a great time last night and to chef Tetsuya! Oh and when you leave, you are handed a memento-- a menu of what you have. Classy to the end!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Date night on last night in Marina Bay Sands,1,50,11-Jul-16,Well all I can say is that we had a truly amazing and wonderful experience at Waku GhinFrom the time you set foot into this establishment you immediately know that you are going to be well looked afterThe service staff are amazing with every detail taken care off with smiles all around making you feel comfortable and welcomeThe freshness of the ingredients used are by far the very best and of high qualityThe preparation and cooking of these ingredients where on show in front of our eyes as we where left in oar on how the flavours married together and left a gastronomic explosion of taste and flavour on our taste budsA huge THANKYOU to Chef Suzuki for a fantastic and amazing experience 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Have you really had fine dining if you haven't dined at Waku Ghin!,1,50,29-Jun-16,"We planned our entire Singapore travel schedule around our Waku Ghin reservation and there was definitely a huge build up to it.. Lucky for us, Waku Ghin didn't disappoint and it was certainly a meal of a lifetime. Service was impeccable, the seafood as fresh as can be, and the flavour combinations simply outstanding."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Celebrating our birthdays at Waku Ghin,1,50,28-Jun-16,"My son and I have the same birth date and wifey kindly booked Waku Ghin for the dinner celebrations. This is my second time there. Our first time was about 7 years ago and we were lucky that Chef Tetsuya was there too for the F1 weekend. Food was of a very high quality and the seafood was as fresh as you can get, though pricings have gone up - degustation was SGD 450 pp and wine pairing SGD 250. The highlight was the uni/caviar/prawn combo for me. Most of the items were similar to the previous time.Desert was at another area with a nice view overlooking the Marina Bay. If you have a special occasion to celebrate and willing to spend, Waku Ghin is a nice place to enjoy Marina Bay Sands."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Exceptional ingredients, great cooking mastery",1,40,11-Jun-16,"An evening to remember. We arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Both of us let the barman design a drink around a single ingredients- sake for me, which resulted into a delightfully surprising result. We had a lovely chat with the sommelier around their wine list and were finally taken to our salon, sitting down at a bar in front of the cooking teppan. Followed 10 dishes that were all delicious, great ingredients, fantastic cooking and seasoning, very decent portions (how can one get out of the place feeling hungry as I read in some reviews is a mystery to me). I even enjoyed abalon, which I usually don't like. Great wine list too.The only slight area of improvement - the staff si sometimes so passionnate that they come a little too often to ask about the dishes and discuss, which may interrupt conversations. This is all with the best of intentions though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but not wow,1,40,3-Jun-16,"Being Asia's #6 best restaurant carries a lot of weight and burden as expectations would be high. To start with the decor and ambience in pleasant and relaxing. Nothing to complain about. The service is exceptional. The waiters are attentive, pleasant and professional. I would give the service 10/10. Now to deal with the food which is the most important element in a restaurant. The dishes are genuine and creative. May by not as one would expect from one of the best restaurants in the world but still there is thought and effort behind the dishes. The taste is good. Some dishes such as the King Crab and the Wagyu Beef were creative as well as tasty. Others were just good, nothing exceptional. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin A Top Tier Japanese Experience in Singapore,1,40,24-May-16,"The Sea Urchin and Caviar is a must for foodies. I would recommend showing up a bit early for your reservation as I really enjoyed watching the Marina Bay Sands casino just before entering into Waku Ghin. No cameras while watching the casino players, but it was a very interesting sight to see. Staff a Waku Ghin are exceptionally well trained, and sophisticated. For Mandarine speaking guests they have very elegant staff who can explain each dish in Mandarine. Service is what one should expect of a world ranked top 50 restaurant, attentive, with wonderful presentation. We opted for the wine pairing and the full menu. The wine pairing was very clever and went well with all of the dishes. I would recommend for the full menu doing the first seating. For us it was timed well to watch the Marina Bay Sands water show while having desert from the scenic Waku Ghin tea room. A very high end private experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing,1,50,23-May-16,"Probably one of the best degustations I have ever had.Wasn't exactly creative, but the effort that goes into the freshness, preparation was phenomenal.The signature uni with caviar and shrimp was a fantastic blend of flavours. The seafood broth with rice was so clear and refreshing....absolute delight.The service was impeccable. Mood, ambience was great.Have to go!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Talking about Japanese Fine Dine: Head to Waku Ghin… You won’t be disappointed!,1,50,22-May-16,"The best Omasake dinner I’ve had! It’s true that it is costly (400+ per pax) but then again, for the experience as special as this…it’s all worth it ? To start with, the service you’ll enjoy is very exclusive. Together with 4 friends, we had our own private dining room… own Chef and Sous-Chef that took extra good care of us all through out the night plus army of staffs that treated us like we are the most important people in the world! We started with cocktails. Very interesting cocktails that I never had anywhere else but there… Then we were escorted to our private dining room. The chef took time explaining the 10-course meal he prepared for us. Every detail of the 10 beautifully presented dishes has been kind of whispered to us while we were enjoying them. Except for the main dish which we were asked to decide on (based on the menu), all the rests were the Chef’s choice. There’s of course over flowing sake that accompanied our sumptous meal. And for the finale - we were once again escorted to the main room where all the guests are directed for the much-awaited dessert. Well you can already guess by now that we’ve once again served with nothing but the best. The one thing stuck in my head is the “black forest” that looked nothing like the usual. There are only 4 private dining rooms and 1 dessert room. So it is a must to call in advance and reserve. If you’re reading this, you must be really considering Waku Ghin ? I’d say first that am jealous! Second, you won’t be disappointed. Enjoy!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Top quality ,1,50,5-May-16,"Unbelievably good food in a friendly atmosphere. Excellent ingredients perfectly prepared. Forget your classic tepan experiences for a totally reinvented cooking discovery. From sea urchins with caviar to perfectly stemmed lobster, every dish was incentive and perfectly realized."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glorious food ,1,50,3-May-16,"Still one of the best restaurants on the planet ... Food, atmosphere and attention by staff is fantastic .. A must on your dinning experience list"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fine dining at its finest,1,50,2-May-16,"If you are a foodie and have the opportunity to splurge, Waku Ghin is one of the finest venue with a luxurious culinary experience to offer.Setting aside the difficulties we had navigating our way around Marina Bay Sands to find the restaurant, the whole dining experience really started as soon as you walk in the door.Service and Experience: Awesome. I love how there is a ""private"" room where it is simply you and the chef as he cooked the dishes in front of us. It's not a teppanyaki bar so do not fear having any eggs being thrown at you. ;)Meal: Exclusively exquisite. There are no other place to taste the dishes.Price: $1000+ for two and it was worth it.Notes: If you are allergic to seafood or if you (or your date) is picky with food, I certainly would have to suggest you think twice about going as you may not find it enjoyable in many levels."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",his signature dish really is amazing,1,40,20-Apr-16,"With the Michelin guide coming to Singapore, I figured we should try this restaurant while we could still get tables. I had trouble with paying this much food for essentially minimally cooked ingredients. After receiving my Visa statement, I still don't think this was worth it but I am glad I tried it. The restaurant is beautiful. You are seated at individual stations with maximum 8 guests. I found it strange that they were so insistent on us arriving on time as the whole room eats together and yet a couple arrived about 45 minutes into our meal and had an abbreviated version of our dinner. It was off-putting simply because they were SO annoying about the time issue beforehand. The food was good but because it is seasonal, you have no say in what you eat. Therefore instead of the salt smoked Alaskan king crab (which I can also get at home but is still a treat), we were served Atlantic lobster, which I grew up eating fresh out of the sea every summer. Needless to say, no matter how fresh it was before it got on the plane, it's not going to taste as good as in Canada. The signature dish was very tasty. Unlike my expectations, there is some sort of marinade (the chef confirmed it) to the shrimp so it is not just a pile of raw ingredients as some critics have suggested. Dessert is served in a lounge with a view and was very nice French style chocolates and cakes. Was it worth $1700 for 2 people? I don't think so, but I'm glad I tried it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Elegant simplicity,1,50,6-Apr-16,"Waku Ghin is a unique dining experience, well worth adding to your culinary destinations list. Seated in groups of 6 in front of a Teppanyaki-style arrangement, our food journey for each dish began as the chef cooked most dishes right in front of us with prepared produce and ingredients.While this final stage of cooking looked easy and effortless, don't be fooled! The real effort towards each dish is done out of eye and likely before you woke up that morning!Dishes are all deceptively simple and designed to hero a particular ingredient - mostly a seafood.We were impressed with every course. All were complex, elegant and simple. The wine list was extensive and we were guided by the somms with ease. We later toured the impressive wine cellar and chatted with he somms until we were the last patrons to leave.Brilliant 5-star dining."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Delicious Food, Attentive and Personalised Service",1,50,4-Apr-16,"If you are looking for a more unique, personalised fine dining experience - this would be it (at a great financial cost).The food was delicious and cannot be faulted by any account. The waitstaff and chef asked if we had any dietary requirements and would tailor the menu accordingly if we did have any. We didn't and was blessed to experience the wide variety of fresh seafood that this restaurant featured. For me, the most outstanding dish was their signature marinated Botan shrimp with Sea urchin and Oscietra caviar (don't have a separate picture unfortunately) and for my partner, the lobster (see picture below) was a standout. We both agreed that the Wagyu was the best that we've tasted (picture also below).My expectation was that there would only be one chef's table that seated 10 - 12 people, but they actually have 4 rooms, each with their (teppanyaki-style) grill. Although that did not impact the excellent service in any way, I didn't expect there to be multiple chefs serving multiple tables. Perhaps if you are considering going here, go with friends or family that fill up one room (our room would seat 6 people) so service and your experience is seamless, i.e. not impacted by your neighbouring diners.For me, this restaurant is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very expensive, and in Singapore there's also a 10% service charge and a 7% tax on top of the bill. I would consider it one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and would cost at least approximately SGP$500 per person. If you add drinks, it can easily be more than that.Price aside, the food, service and restaurant is definitely 10/10, I highly recommend you try it if you are considering it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best dinning experience ,1,50,1-Apr-16,"By far the best dinning experience ever! We reluctantly passed through Singapore on our way to the Maldives (now we wish we'd stayed longer). Back to Waku Ghin... we enjoyed a private dining experience, with our own chef who cooked approx a dozen tasting dishes in front of us throughout the night. Each dish was presented impeccably and tasted even better then they looked! From the hand crafted ice dome in my husband's scotch, to the fresh ingredients used through out, this was an experience of a life time. The staff were extremely professional and our chef was wonderfully polite, we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with him through out the night. For dessert we were moved to a large open dinning room, with views spanning across the bay, allowing us to enjoy the 'Wonder Full' light and laser show in seclusion. As we left, the chef basically chased us out of the restaurant to personally say goodbye. The evening cost us approx $1,300 (AUD) for the two of us but in my opinion it was worth every cent. Not every dining experience here would cost the same, however we did enjoy some great wine & scotch with our food. Despite Singapore exceeding all our expectations, I've said many times that I would go back to Singapore just to eat here again, so much so, we are planning a trip next month! I can't wait!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A once in a lifetime experience.,1,50,28-Mar-16,"As huge fans and regular patrons of Tetsuyas in Sydney, we were keen to visit the sister restaurant in Singapore and were not disappointed. With only 25 diners per night, it certainly makes it expensive but gives the opportunity for a unique experience. In our own room with 5 diners, we were highly entertained by our chef who prepared each course in front of us. Our Japanese chef had worked in Sydney for some years and had excellent English. The food and ingredients were stunning and as expected, the service was impeccable. Moving to the Dessert Room is a wonderful conclusion to a perfect evening."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sky-high price for dinner, worth trying",1,40,23-Mar-16,"This is certainly the most expensive restaurant I've tried so far, by quite a wide margin. Is it worth it? Perhaps....after all, the dishes did feature all the premium ingredients - truffles, caviar, lobster, wagyu beef... There's hardly a weak dish (for me it was the abalone, which was rather rubbery). Even the simplest-looking dish like a bowl of cold japanese noodle can be impressive.And of course you pay for the showmanship, as many of the dishes are cooked right in front of you. All the staff were professional and informative, including the Japanese chef in our room who explained each dish (he spoke excellent English). Drinks were very expensive (water for S$ 20++ !), and even having a glass of cocktail and another glass of wine could add to your bill substantially.But I think Waku Ghin could afford to be less rigid, and offer cheaper options for the set menu. In many fine dining restaurants, some premium ingredients are offered as optional supplements. After all, not everyone is crazy for caviar (or truffles, for that matter). Many years ago I went to Tetsuya's in Sydney and while it was a different cuisine (more Franco-Japanese than pure Japanese), it was much more affordable, with the same high level of technique in the dishes and a top service."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",excellent japanese experience,1,50,15-Mar-16,we enjoyed our Counter with only four People in the room. the Food is excellent. the ingredients are of the highest Quality. worth the high Price you have to pay.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best of the best,1,50,15-Mar-16,"one of the best restaurants I've eaten in!
the dishes of the set menu complemented each other very well, cocktails were interesting
service very professional"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very expensive, but you got back what you paid",1,40,1-Mar-16,"A friend who has been to this venue many times suggested us to try it. It is a somewhat fusion Japanese venue, or they are serving a mix of Japanese foods plus some western dishes.I think they only serve a fixed menu of the day during dinner hours. We had many present surprises with the foods that they served, starting from the very first course. For the entire dinner, there were only 2 or 3 courses that were less impressive; nevertheless, still tasted ok. One of the most unexpected surprises was the noodle in a cold soup with lime juice taste; it was such a refreshing dish after the heavy meal (before the deserts).The only drawback that I could think of was its price tag, approx. S$700+ per head. Nevertheless, you are getting back what you paid through the services that they provided and the foods that they served. Should give it a try when you are in town, and of course when you can afford to indulge yourself with a fancy dinner."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience ,1,50,27-Feb-16,"Had our anniversary dinner at Waku Ghin. We were greeted to a room with 4 sittings. The chef cook & serve in front of us. Foods were luxury & tasty, like works of art ! Very enjoyable ! I must say it is not the type of restaurant that you go often as the set menu is about $500 per head. But it is definitely worth a try if you love high quality Japanese food. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Omakase,1,50,27-Feb-16,Waku Ghin definitely is one of the top Japanese resto in Singapore. Located on the 3rd floor of MBS casino. The seafood cooking is fantastic. The dessert also super felicious. Chef Tetsuya is rank 9th at this time of writing in Asia so definitely a must try.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",All the gourmet food you can think of!,1,50,20-Jan-16,"I've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney and I loved it so I was very excited to go to the one in Singapore. The restaurant is located in the new trendy hotel, Marina Bay Sands. It was around 5 minutes walk from the hotel and it was closer to Casino and the shops and the restaurant was on the second floor. Welcomed warmly by the staff, we sat in the very private room in front of the teppanyaki grill. We ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate the night ($50 per glass, the drinks are very expensive) and the chef brought out all the ingredients that they were going to use. The menu was not on the website and they don't give it to you till the end of the night (this part was the same as the Tetsuya's in Sydney). The menu included carpaccio of flounder with bitter salad, marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar (signature dish), slow cooked New Zealand John Dory with charcoal grilled eggplant, puree of potato with soft poached egg (onset eggs) truffle and caviar, warm salad of abalone with asparagus and Chinese olive, braised Canadian lobster with tarragon, Japanese wagyu (Shiga, and it was A5 rank) with fresh wasabi and ponzu, and then a rice or a noodle dish to finish then gyokuryo (highest quality green tea) and two desserts. Overall, amazing food and service, I enjoyed a nice interaction with the chef. When you pay $450 per person, it's a bit hard to get something wrong. Everything was perfect. The sommelier was knowledgeable, we had a lovely cocktail made by a very polite bar person and our floor staff was very attentive. The hard thing for these restaurant is that people have different expectations so if one small thing goes wrong or it's not what they were expecting, people do get very disappointed. The food was cooked to perfection and I couldn't fault the service. Tetsuya is a world known chef and I loved his food. A lot more seafood compared to Sydney and I would have to say that the food was more Japanese then the one in Sydney. I had a glass of sake after the champagne instead of wine but I would recommend wine with the meal as well. They have a great extensive list of sake and wine and the sommelier is there to give you any advise. It's a once in a life time experience, but if you go, don't expect anything and just enjoy the night. Ask questions to the chef, they are more than happy to explain anything if you are interested. It's an amazing experience no questions asked about that."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in lifetime experience! ,1,50,20-Jan-16,"The price made me worry, it's the most I have spent on a meal and our bill was around $1400 for my wife and I, but we had said yes to everything and his included cocktails, beers, sparkling water and sake. We said yes to all options! The service, food and ambience is 2nd to none and had the most lovely feeling about it. It's quiet, no music and we were whispering, it all added to the feel and experience. The food is stunning and has so much quality, each of the 10 courses and 3 deserts, were world class and were presented in a way that even foodies like my wife were forced to take pics of each meal. All the photos shown are a true reflection of the amazing attention to detail they show on every step of your experience. It was like a performance, as you watch them prepare most of the courses right in front of you and we were sorted with just 2 other couples, but still felt very private as they speak to each group separately and we never feel like a group or anything. It was the one booking we made well in advance of course and planned and we do not regret it. We took to the 2nd sitting at 8:30pm so I suggest to watch the laser show first, then hot the casino for a look and then to dinner. It's all a few mins walk from each over.This place deserves its popularity and demand and we are impressed and delighted to encourage people to make this a special occasion experience. We will never forget his meal and their attention to detail. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very Japanese,1,40,16-Dec-15,"We began with a chilled soup of Japanese sweet corn with Australian winter truffles and saffron ice cream. The flavour of the corn came through nicely in the soup, not being too sweet, and the saffron ice cream avoided the strongly metallic taste that saffron often brings; the truffles were not overly aromatic, but they added a pleasant additional and subtle fragrance to the soup (17/20). Next was a dish I recall from earlier visits to Tetsuya, marinated botan edi (a large Japanese shrimp) with sea urchin and osetra caviar, presented in a hollowed out sea urchin shell. This was an attractively presented dish that had excellent quality sea urchin and good prawns, the saltiness of the caviar balancing the richness of the sea urchin, and the prawns giving a different textural element to the dish (18/20).The teppan grill came into play for the first time with the next course, with pan-fried fillet of ayu (sweet fish) on a bed of daikon and fennel. This was a very simple dish, and although pleasant and in season, the quality of the ayu was not in the same league as several I have eaten in Japan, where considerable effort goes into ultra-seasonal sourcing (in some cases the fish is sourced from different places according to two week mini-seasons, ensuring the absolute peak of quality). Still, this was a perfectly enjoyable dish 16/20).Next was Alaskan king crab, steamed under a copper pan on the grill in front of us on a bed of sea salt, served very simply with lemon scented extra virgin olive oil from Italy. This was a dish with nowhere to hide, and the cooking technique was faultless, the crab cooked exactly right, the lemon adding just a hint of acidity to balance the crab (19/20). Next was abalone from Tasmania, grilled and served on a bed of fregola and tomato. Although the abalone was good, again I found it less so that some of the remarkable abalone I have eaten in Japan (such as at Ryugin in Tokyo), though the Mediterranean accompaniments worked well enough (16/20). Canadian lobster was next, simply braised with a tarragon stock with a little paprika cream and a shellfish sauce using lobster shells and reduced for several hours. The lobster was lightly cooked, avoiding the chewiness that so often happens with this ingredient, and the light scented stock was a harmonious accompaniment to the shellfish (18/20).There was now an interesting contrast of two beef dishes. First was a tenderloin of Tasmanian grass-fed steak with mustard made from wasabi grown in Tasmania. This was also served with freshly grated wasabi from Japan. The beef was of excellent quality, lightly cooked, but the revelation to me was the wasabi. In the west we are used to being served ""wasabi"" that is in fact horseradish with green food colouring, which gives a simple one-dimensional heat. I have had real wasabi many times in Japan, and this delivers a much more complex flavour, an initial burst of spicy heat followed by a less spicy flavour, with almost a creaminess of texture. Wasabi comes in many different grades of quality, and the one tonight was of the highest standard, displaying a lovely complex set of flavour notes (19/20). I found the wasabi almost more interesting than the excellent beef. Immediately after this was grilled wagyu beef (grade A5) from Omi prefecture in Japan, aged for just over three weeks. This was heavily marbled with fat and had the rich flavour that comes from that degree of marbling. As with much wagyu beef, it ca be so marbled that you almost forget that you are eating beef at all, and this was the case tonight. This was served with more of the lovely grated wasabi and also maitake mushrooms, with a little citrus soy as a garnish; it is more a preference than anything technical, but I actually preferred the grass fed Tasmanian beef tonight (18/20). To finish the savoury courses was a dish of rice on which was placed a little flounder, which was then immersed in consommé. The chicken consommé was superb, clear and with lovely clean aromatic flavour, nicely complementing the fish (easily 18/20). Dessert was served in a separate room next to the wine storage area, with a view out over the water. Granita of Kyoho grapes (a variety from Jaan) was superb, the texture of the granita spot on and the grapes having excellent flavour (19/20). Japanese white peach was seabed on a bed of champagne granita, and although the peach did not quite have the perfection of some I have eaten in Japan it was certainly lovely, ripe and with delicate flavour (18/20). Finally, a little lemon curd cheesecake was excellent, and even better was a rich chocolate mousse made with Valrhona chocolate, with velvety texture (easily 18/20)."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Exceptional cocktails and small plates at the bar, with no reservation!",1,50,13-Dec-15,"I went to the bar at Waku Ghin on a Saturday night at around 9:30pm. There was plenty of space at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan (they used Rittenhouse 100 rye), which was made perfectly. In addition I ate some Wagyu beef, which was spectacular. The service was exceptional."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Extensive wine list,1,40,7-Dec-15,"This is my first time at WG and mostly probably last as the self indulgence cost was a bit too exorbitant for my taste bud. My wife had arrange birthday dinner week for me in Singapore to try the various fine dining spots like Les Amis, Iggy's, Odette, and Andre.You have been warned ahead upon reservation about the shared seating counter arrangement with griddle cooking fashion and the high prices for drinks and food.The 'funny or interesting or odd' part of the whole dinner was that it felt like a communal private wedding affair where all the guests in the same private room had to go thru the same ritual. In our case we shared the room with 2 other couples and had to hear the introduction of the seafood platter and truffle special offering 3 times.What most guests can't accept as in other reviews have mentioned, was the loud noise from some stranger sharing the counter with you. In our case, we had a loud matured guy sharing his resume or career to his new girlfriend and with the rest of the other guests. For such a high end (exorbitantly expensive) dining place, I would assume most guests would want some privacy and silence.We have never dine much in Singapore because service and food value has never been on par with other countries. The only reason wife chose to dine all these restaurants for once this week was because our annual France food and wine pilgrimage was cancelled due to the attacks.A reputable Japanese chef and friend once told me you can teach a sushi or teppanyaki chef the cooking skills over many years but you cant teach him the art of communication over the counter, which is a major pre-requisite for this cooking approach and in this aspect, half the battle is either won or lost with the customer.WG is prime for this aspect of dining experience since it's a counter griddle cooking style but only 3 items (lobster and 2 beef) out of the 10 menu is cooked in front of you. Most of the other food items are pre prepared in the kitchen. But throughout the whole dining experience the chef did not attempt to interact with the guests or because the lack of usage of the griddle or lack of presence of the chef since he is cooking in the kitchen instead, which I am trying to figure till today.Bottomlime, what's the objective of a shared counter dining experience when little is being shared except from some annoyance and loud noise from some other guests. I had to attempt to make small talk with the chef in attendance and ask him what sauce is he using, which area of Tasmania (Cape Grim vs Blackmore) is the beef from ? What grade is the Omi beef ?Just to reinforce what the earlier reviewer mentioned about the bread, I share the same sentiment that the mgmt need to quickly get a new pastry chef to relook at their pastry offerings. Or maybe have a meal at Andre and Odette just for the bread basket.Overall, food portions are small but of extremely high quality produce. I give them high marks for the food (except pastry), but low marks on the dining experience that's why the 4 rating instead of a overall 5.WG will get their 1 star but may be awarded 2 stars because of its extensive wine list, DRC is priced between $45k to 55k a bottle. Heard no high rollers have open a bottle yet.Just for name sake and if you do not mind paying $750pp and share a counter seat, pls dine here. If not, I think Andre, Odette, Les Amis (in order of rank) has better value and better fine dining experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Always Special to go back there - most expensive restaurant in the world ?,1,40,5-Dec-15,"Located right at the Marina Bay Sands, where patrons usually don't think too much about value, or money . If you go at Wakughin, don't think either about value. Just accept the price - it will be a minimum of 750 Sing a head. You will be getting a great experience there, beautiful sake, beautiful wine, great food and an impeccable service. The odd bit was the bread ..which, despite beeing apparently baked in house, looked and tasted like a baguette made ifor Supermarkets ! Rest was excellent, wish the lobster stock/reduction would have been more flavorful - the concentration was un sufficient - the signature dish was of course , as usual the real winner . Not a three stars in my view. But a good two stars . "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japanese gastronomic high end,1,50,3-Dec-15,"Usually i hate malls and restaurants inside, and when you arrive to your private room, you can only be feeling trapped. But the food journey, the dining experience, the variety of dishes, the products and cooking quality is so high.. When you are invited to join the common dessert room with (at last !) a view on the marina, you realize it s exceptionnal. On top of that desserts are excellent, not far from a french starred dessert chef.. Service a bit rigid and overwhelming but the cook was nice and discreet which made it globally very good anyway. It s super expensive, definitely not worth any diner, but it s poshy place, singapore, far above competition, fully booked all the time, so just bring your platinum visa and forget about it and enjoy if you can."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","always at its best, innovative .",1,50,19-Nov-15,"The pinacle of haute japanese cuisine. From the outstanding service to the awesome dish presentation to the taste. Very innovative and passionate .
Very individualised service at the tapanyaki counter."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Cocktails and oysters! ,1,50,6-Nov-15,"We had cocktails and oysters at the bar. These surely must be the best cocktails in town, the bartender is a proper cocktail bartender. We had the Irish and the Canadian oysters, they were both delicious."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Glad I went...! ,1,40,2-Nov-15,"This place is expensive! The food was great and very well presented. Some amazing produce cooked to perfection. The restaurant itself is a little impersonal. We were in a 2 and had to share our kitchen with another pair. It was a bit awkward and quiet. Wine by the glass menu was a bit limited, but had some good choices. The special of the night was a couple of dishes using white truffle which was out of this world. Not sure I'd go back, given the price but I'm glad I went."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique experience, including the laser light show",1,50,24-Oct-15,"A Top 100 World list place we just had to try. The location, above the large casino floor, is interesting but the noise is not a factor once you get inside. Seating is bar-like in front of the cooking table with several other diners, but only 6 people a separate room. The tasting menu is very well done, mostly seafood and well presented. The one glitch was no one offered us a drink before dinner nor a wine list. We had to ask if there was wine or wine pairings, after which they said, ""Oh yes"". Once that hurdle was overcome, the wine pairings were quite nice. After dinner and before dessert, you are escorted to a more conventional dining area with a window over the bay. While finishing dessert and coffee, you view the laser light show. A great ending to a wonderful dinner. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great stuff,1,50,21-Oct-15,Real good stuff with top quality ingredients. Tho it is quite expensive. Personally i would have preferred a more simple serving of the wagyu beef as opposed to different sauces placed on it
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sea Urchin????,1,50,20-Oct-15,"Based on the reviewers, I decided to try this restaurant. I am interested to visiting this place because, I can taste the pleasures of sea urchins.. and finalyyyy I tasted straight sea urchin ... and it offered a sense of truly exceptional.. WONDERFULL"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting Dining Experience from the mind of Tetsuya,1,40,19-Oct-15,"We booked for our anniversary (6 weeks beforehand) because we had heard about this restaurant. Even though it doesn't quite rank on the World scale, it still is on every Foodie's list to visit. The communal-style dining booths are a bit hard to get used to particularly if you have annoyingly loud strangers as your dining companions (which we did). You sit up at a Teppan plate with your own chef who cooks for you. This is terrific and if you have a friendly chef, it makes for an great dinner conversation (which it was). We supped on a plethora of fresh seafood including sea urchin, Tasmanian abalone (we flew thousands of kms to eat Aussie local!) and scampi and finished with Wagyu. You are then transferred to a quieter dining room to finish your desserts. It was an experience that whilst very expensive, and not quite the romantic anniversary dinner we were hoping for, was definitely worth ticking off the list."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing restauarnt,1,50,6-Oct-15,"This restaurant really is an experience. It is also outrageously expensive. The sea urchin was interesting to say the least. You sit in one of 4 small rooms. There were 3 of us in one room when I visited. Some of the food is brought to you already plated, and other meals are prepared in front of you by your personal chef. For desserts you go to another room. All great fun"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Expensive, but really good",1,50,13-Sep-15,"This is the most expensive meal I've had in my whole life. Despite that statement, it's one of the best food I've had in my life. Since it's a 10 degustation course; we were estimating the cost of each dish, and more or less it's really worth the amount you're paying for. I enjoyed as well being right in front of the chef as they prepare the dishes in front of you. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An unforgettable dinner prepared by chef Masaya Suzuki,1,50,13-Sep-15,I love Japanese food. And I particularly like sea urchin. So when I found out about a Japanese restaurant that incorporates sea urchin into its signature dish I had to try it.The restaurant is located in the Marina Bay Sands complex and one of the dele rity chef restaurants. I enjoyed the 10 course omakase menu prepared by chef Suzuki Right in front of me and 4 other guests - particularly the sea urchin signature dish. I was also introduced to a delicious sake from the Masuizumi brewery's platinum collection. I have never tasted such a smooth and well balanced sake before.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Elevated Contemporary Japanese....good, but not great.",1,40,24-Aug-15,"Tetsuya Wakuda as a brilliant chef brings me back memories of my time in Sydney in 2000, so when I saw his restaurant in Singapore (back in 2014) was on the top 50 list, I needed to go! You have to meander above the casino floor to go to the restaurant, but once in you are transformed by the decor. Very stylish, very sleek. You are ushered to a room where there is about 8 chairs in front of a teppanyaki cook top where you chef prepares all sort of delightful dishes. It was very entertaining and inspiring to watch the process. The presentation was spectacular and visually very appealing, but the flavour (especially after our dinner at Andre) it was not great, mind you it was very delicious, but I guess I was expecting transcendence. Would I recommend the place, sure but maybe as a second or third choice of restaurants in Singapore. The food was wonderful, but I guess my expectations was a little too high."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Modern Japanese Cuisine with Excellent Service,1,40,23-Aug-15,"serving modern japanese cuisine, bringing new twist to the usual ones you used to have. excellent service, extensive wine collection available."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great Dinner,1,50,18-Aug-15,"I tried Tetsuya in Sydney many years ago and that was memorable. I heard a lot of great reviews about Waku Ghin, I visited, and was not disappointed. The restaurant was nicely decorated , the food was excellent ( nothing too fancy ) and the services were top class. I liked to bamboo clams and steak most in the tasting menu, but truly , everything else was well executed. Thanks again, chef Tetsuya."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Simply The Best,1,50,17-Aug-15,"Chef Tetsuya cooks the best food with the best ingredients ... Waku Ghin gives nothing but the best food and service ... The Botan Shrimp and Uni, The Ohmi Beef are our faves!"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Visiting Tets in Sing,1,50,28-Jul-15,"Been loving Tets food in Sydney for over 20 years so when we were in Sing, couldn't resist when the opportunity to dine at Tet's venture in Sing. It's only seats 20+ people at a time, most dishes were cooked in front of diners. Some of the produces were flown in from Tasmania, Japan etc… Waku Ghin serves Japanese dishes, unlike Tetsuya's in Sydney (Japanese with a touch of French). Excellent meal… Excellent selection of wine and sake too…Highly recommend"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive!,1,50,13-Jul-15,"The entire experience was awesome, all the dishes were beautiful, using the best ingredients and pretty culinary skills. Quite pricey $400++ exclude drinks for 10 courses, but definitely worth!

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Welcome to Singapore,1,50,11-Jul-15,"One of our first meals in Singapore after moving from Sydney. Amazing experience, amazing food, once in a lifetime! We got a tour of the kitchen after our meal as we were so complimentary! Don't recommend for non seafood lovers."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic dinner. I thought the bill was in Yen though. But if you can afford It. Go there !,1,40,6-Jul-15,"Fantastic experience. Served and pampered at a special counter. Had our own chef. The food was unbelivable, still remember the sea urchin dishes, and multiple creative variations around Japanese Food. One of the very best meals and services we gave had full stop."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Simply Superb,1,50,19-Jun-15,"If you are going to splash out once in Singapore then this is the place. Everything from start to finish was superb. The very friendly greeting, intimate dining room with your own chef, theatrical cooking and sublime food with matching wines -all served very discretely and professionally. Yes it is mega expensive but( as stated many times in previous reviews) you know that before you go- just enjoy you only live once!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fancy, Fancy, Fancy! Pricey, Pricey, Pricey! Despite, Excellent Food and Service!",1,50,15-Jun-15,"If I had to give a quick sentence that describes my dining experience at Waku Ghin, it would be: It is like Benihana Hibachi restaurant but with better food and impeccable service. Yes, I know...comparing Asia's top restaurant to a Benihana is almost profane. The only qualities that they have in common are the sous chef cooking in front of a group of 6 people with a flattop grill, and they both serve ""Japanese"" food (the quotes pertain to Benihana).Anywho, Waku Ghin was a delightful experience, from beginning to end. The wait staff was extremely attentive. Some people might be annoyed with that; however, with the money that you're paying for this meal, you almost expect the staff to give you a back rub or even spoon feed you your dinner (jokes). There was a moment where I dropped my napkin AND my chopsticks back-to-back (due to the consumption of a half a bottle of vino). Sure enough, the speedy waiters replaced both in a sec! The food? Amazing. One of the best meals that I've ever had. The sea urchin/shrimp/cavier was amazing. Both beef dishes (Tasmanian/Wagyu) were the simplest, most delicious meat dishes that I've had. The desserts? Yummy. The pastry chef made a special wild strawberry and lavender honey cream crumble for us. I made it clear to the waiter that I don't eat berries, except for strawberries. This was just in case they were going to serve a ""berry"" dessert. So, they brought out this special strawberry dessert for us. :) Everybody else got a luscious-looking chocolate dessert, which would have been excellent to try. Oh well! Overall, this dining experience was, truly, a unique one. And, yes, most reviewers griped how expensive it is. Yes, it is a pricey restaurant. Would I preferred to pay less for this meal? Of course!! However, the bottom line is that this is a top restaurant, ran by a very popular Japanese chef, located in a very expensive hotel/casino. I believe you get what you pay for. This kind of Japanese food is meant to be simplistic, adventurous, and opulent. My advice is to keep an open mind and enjoy the food. Smell every dish. Savor every bite. This ain't your local neighborhood's Benihana's! This is elegant food at its best."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Friendly staff Amazing food,1,40,15-Jun-15,Fabulous restaurant very exspensive but great for a very special treat The staff are so friendly and helpful especially the sommelier who didn't overwhelm us with the prices of wine and selected a good Wine at a reasonable price The food is amazing and prepared freshly in front of you I would defiantly recommend this restaurant
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best Japanese Restaurant in the World,1,50,19-May-15,"This is an absolute MUST! If you like Japanese cuisine (and even if you don't), you just have to go there. Each course is amazingly designed, both visually and in terms of taste, can be accompanied with wine or sake (huge selection available for both) and will have you taste Japanese food in a new way!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Unique experience,1,50,19-May-15,"This was one of the best dinner I have ever had!In the beginning it was difficult to find the place. You need to take an elevator, which is somewhat hidden to level 4 the atrium. Make sure you know where it is.Once you are there it is a special, sophisticated atmosphere. The service is high class Asian style, which from my point of view is much better than western type. It makes the guest feel very special and is never annoying.Going into the separe you are seated at a big counter in front of the teppan grill, where we were in total four people. Even it is a counter, there is much space and privacy. We were seated with two other people, but we still felt comfortable.And now the food, the reason why you should go to this place, it was outrageous, just unique! A 10 course menu, mainly seafood, just one Kobe beef dish, but definitely great. It's a mix of Japanese and high European cuisine. The dishes build up well. The highlight, which are many, were the signatory dish, raw botan shrimp, sea urchin and oscietra caviar. New Zealand scampi with gnocchi, so pure and delicious. Tasmanian abalone with a type of risotto. My favourite, slowly braised Canadian lobster. It was so tender and the sauce to deep in complexity, this was one of the best dishes I ever had, and the best lobster I have ever eaten. The taste of slowly cooked made it so special, besides the quality obviously. Incredible! The Kobe beef was served with fresh wasabi from the root, very special, I never had this before.And the desert were very good as well, it is served in another area with nice views on the marinha bay. For drinks, as usual in Singapore, alcohol is expensive. Instead of having four glasses of wine for a hundred dollar, you should take a full bottle for the same price. There is a good choice, we took a new zeeland white wine, there was only one. I like the mineral taste of this type and it was good.This was a definitively expensive experience, but worthwhile the full experience. If you can afford it, and you like high quality seafood you will be overwhelmed in this place. Go there! Next time I am in Singapore I will make sure to return. A unique experience, with world class seafood!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic,1,50,26-Apr-15,This is a MUST in Singapore. The food is spectacular and interestingly composed. Service and presentation was exceptional. View from the post dining room great too which allows you to chill and talk. Problem is getting a reservation.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",On my best 3 restaurant,1,50,23-Apr-15,Since I step in the restaurant till the goodbye I had one of my best food and hospitality experience. Beside a great meal execute to perfection and great attention to details the balance of the dish was great. A linear crescendo that I really appreciate. Service was discrete but present at the right moment. Polite and with a smile that make thinks always better. Definitely in my best 3 restaurant since today. Thanks for the great experience. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Every course was incredible,1,50,8-Apr-15,"I'm rating this restaurant 5 stars based on solely the food and service.
The food was incredible. To be honest I could hardly pronounce any of the ingredients, but the waitstaff who hand delivered our plates to us described exactly what they used."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great ingredients and faultless service,1,40,28-Mar-15,"Online booking is a breeze and the email responses are rapid and thorough. The restaurant takes seatings for dinner only at 6.30pm and 8.30pm. Menu is a 10-item degustation where dietary restrictions are entertained. There is a bar outside and drinks can be brought into the restaurant proper. There are 2 private rooms/cooking stations where 7-8 guests sit at a table in front of a chef. The fresh seafood ingredients are presented to diners for their admiration before dinner starts. Diners are offered still, sparkling or mineral water with free flow over the evening for a fixed price per person. We had the famed botan shrimp with uni and caviar, abalone, scampi and lobster. A thin piece of ohmi beef was also on the menu. The Japanese chef was polite but not completely comprehensible. We enjoyed his cooking techniqes. At one point we were politely advised by a member of the wait staff not to take videos of the cooking, but that still photos were fine. After the savoury dishes diners then are invited to a lounge for desserts, where desserts, petit fours and coffee/tea are served to round off the meal. I found the food tasty and well-presented, although I think it is hard to go wrong with the premium ingredients used. I did not find the dishes exceptional in creativity - no real 'wow' factor. All in all, was happy I came, but do not think it's worth coming again in view of the price! One can get excellent Japanese (and other food) for a fraction of the cost with equivalent satisfaction."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Top 20 best in Asia,1,50,26-Mar-15,Abit pricy $400++ pp but if you love seafood then this place is to be ... Nothing fancy besides the ingredients ... simple food cooked well. Pretty food and great skills no wow factor but nothing wrong with the food :) just no wow factor.Highlight dishesTetsuya chocolate cake
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",a rarely 4.5 star for a japanese restaurant in Sg,1,40,21-Mar-15,"it is extremely close to a full marks minus some of its logistic timing arrangement (fixed 8pm or 530pm dinner timing w totally no lunch timing) and limited window view , as well as some limited choices of wine/sake (some options only have a whole bottle rather than in per glass charging)Its standard is well-maintained from service to pleasant-looking & attentive staff (well diverse of races). Not to mention its standards in Culinary: primarily focused on most japanese-imported stuff with fusion. Freshness, Fine dining...They could be even more daring in their attempt, i felt safe but i would love to see some risks...All of us love the tenderness of its bread (little things score!) , and then its caviar, boston lobster, sea urchin, the honeydew is fibrous w natural sweetness...(two types of beef : Ohmi beef and sorry i forgot the other one)The abalone from aust didnt really fare on the highest range of scores...We can ask for another round of bread or cold dish too, however it is just too filling, though the meal is served only in degustation form(Side point: Luv their signage of their lavatories )Do NOT step in if you do not have S$500 per pax....is that why the server is shocked that i m a Singaporean (yet not a paid food critic)?"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent romantic dinner,1,50,12-Mar-15,"What more can you ask for in a restaurant when the chefs, service and food made me look like the perfect husband I am. My wife could not stop raving about our experience at Waku Ghin and the price tag was not an issue after our luck at the pontoon table. Perfect end to our weekend at sands."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great,1,50,4-Mar-15,"This was a great experience with a good concept.For the savoury dishes, you are seated in a communal room that seats 4 with a chef who prepares some of the dishes in front of you on the grill. The chef was very personable and explained the dishes thoroughly and the staff provided great service.For the dessert courses, you are moved into the main restaurant area which over looks Marina Bay. The cost is $400 (not including 7% gst and 10% service charge), however is well worth it as it is a unique experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can't describe how good this place is,1,50,3-Mar-15,"Being a harsh critic and being to so many fine dining restaurants in the world this tops the list.Starting with the service, the chefs, the food and the atmosphere.Yes it's expensive but 100% you will not experience this again unless you come here.10/10 and if we come back to Singapore we would be sure on making a reservation. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food experience,1,50,1-Mar-15,"The concept is nice, the chef is cooking in front of you, you get the see the products before they are cooked, everything is perfect even if the seating is not very sociable as guests are aligned in front of the cooking table so difficult to interact with the other person but the one next to you. The food was absolutely amazing and so was the wine. At the end of the meal you are taking to a salon to have your dessert and coffee. The cake was really good ( not often the case in Asia !!!) and the staff is really helpful and friendly. It does come with an hefty bill to match though so be prepared to spend some serious cash to have this amazing experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Double Celebration justifies the price...,1,50,19-Feb-15,"Was there to celebrate wife's birthday with her favourite niece, nephew and spouses. Interesting that the chopsticks were visibly damp - reason is to prevent food from sticking and apparently it's also a Japanese welcome. Food, ambience and service are as described by the other reviews.. price too. We thoroughly enjoyed the recommended sake and champagne! Thoughtful of them to provide a dainty birthday cake but even more thoughtful was an additional Anniversary dessert - they probably took the cue from our noisy Yam Sengs... much appreciated."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A real dining experience!,1,50,10-Feb-15,"This was one of my best meals ever! I had been to Tetsuya's restaurant in Sydney and was blown away by that experience, so I thought I would treat my girlfriend to a dinner at Waku Ghin. The meal was an amazing experience. The service was exceptional and the professionalism of the staff was impressive. We were lucky to get a great table where the Sous Chef himself cooked for us! Wow! No menu, beautiful seafood that is presented to you prior to your dinner, and course after course of wonderfully cooked and unadulterated food! The attention to detail is amazing! From the choice of tableware, ingredients, to even serving Gyokuro tea! My hat goes off! The sake sommelier was an extremely nice touch also! Would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore. The highlight of the meal for me was definitely the urchins!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Romantic dinner ,1,40,1-Feb-15,Took my wife for a treat - amazing food - equally amazing bill. From a culinary point of view really enjoyable but just so hard to justify the crazy bill.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The best dinner yet!,1,50,29-Jan-15,"Yep, this is the one. The food was exceptional. The service impeccable. The chef friendly, knowledgable and very skilful. Don't eat all day so you can saviour the food. Testuya has well and truly excelled himself in this Japanese inspired restaurant."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant meal and experience!,1,50,24-Jan-15,"Well worth the accolade of 7th best resturant in Asia (San Pellegrino) the preparation, ingredients and quality of cooking is top notch. A very different experience to Tetsuyas in Sydney, but that's what's great about it, it's not a Nobu style cut and paste job. Very well thought out. High attention to detail. Don't miss a cocktail at the bar before your meal!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of my Favourite Dining experiences!,1,50,14-Jan-15,"Waku Ghin was one of the best meals I've had in my life - completely memorable.Having dined at many michelin/san pellegrino top 50 restaurants/hatted, usually most meals blur together making it hard to remember.Per Se is probably my favourite restaurant and one that i remember clearly and Waku Ghin is probably up there also.The food was amazing, the showmanship and experience made it a wonderful night out."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",High quality dining experience!,1,40,1-Jan-15,"Even though it was quite pricey, we had a great time as the chef was very friendly and the ingredients were extremely fresh and unique. The highlight was the sea urchin with caviar! Heavenly! Would definitely come back again!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",In two minds,1,40,26-Dec-14,"Loved the concept - personal chef etc - and their were some standout dishes (Sea urchin, Caviar). As a total dining experience though, just fell short of being ""wow"". Great, but not in our top 10."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",As expected,1,50,24-Dec-14,"Having had the opportunity to visit Tetsuya's Tetsuya's in Sydney twice I did not want to miss the chance to visit this Singapore location. I was not disappointed. Food was innovatively prepared, well tasting- and served. Service was attentive and well executed. Seating might not suit everybody. Nothing to complain about."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Again and again... And again.. The best restaurant in the world...,1,50,7-Dec-14,"After probably over 10 diners at Waku Ghin the last 3 years, it is each time the best gastronomic experience in the world...again and again and again..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Special Occasion,1,40,30-Nov-14,"The entire experience is fantastic. The doors are opened as you walk in, the preparation of the first drink in proper Japanese perfection, the courteous nature of the staff, the chefs. And then the food - impeccable, sublime, heavenly. Expensive - but worth every cent for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting concept,1,50,20-Nov-14,"The concept of the restaurant is that you sort of have your own personal chef who caters to your culinary needs. Unfortunately if you are only two you will be seated with strangers, so if privacy is an issue you should probably take it up with management beforehand. The young chef was knowledgeable and combined service with excellent cooking. The menu is varied. The chef explained the concept is French cuisine with a Japanese twist, but for my western taste it seemed more Japanese to me. I loved their sea urchin creation and could eat easily ten of them. You can enjoy a laser show during dessert if you get the timing right, the laser show was at 21:00."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Highly recommended!,1,50,16-Nov-14,"Nice arrival at the foyer from Marina Sands Mall where you can see the interior of the Casino.Great reception from the staff. Placed in a private dinning room at the chef's table!Amazing Japanese fusion kitchen where we were offered a 12 course dinner based in the best quality ingredients presented upon arrival!Perfect combination of flavors, and portions! Impeccable presentation!Pricy but worth every penny!!!Highly recommended!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore,1,50,15-Nov-14,"I was here for a birthday treat given by my husband. A few dishes stood out in particular. 1. Fresh oyster given an Asian dressing (Alas, I have forgotten the names of the dishes) I would have never thought to pair oyster with vinegar. That was brilliant.2. Smoked eggplant. I would never have thought eggplant could taste like this. The smokiness that came along with the eggplant was sublime.3. Omi beef. Need I say more?4. Scampi. It was juicy, fleshy, tasty... I don't know if I could use any more adjectives for this.The gyokuro served at the end of the meal was a lovely touch.The only dish that we were a little disappointed with was the uni with caviar. Perhaps, the earlier dishes have built the expectations too high for this signature dish. Or perhaps, we were too used to the uni served at the sushi-yas. It did not suit my palate.Otherwise, it was a fantastic meal with impeccable service at Waku Ghin. This restaurant is easily one of the best in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakase tepanyaki,1,50,18-Oct-14,"It's very delicious, very simple, and only omakase. Reservation is tough though.. Very difficult but it's worth every penny. The appetizer is good, the Sea urchin appetizer is excellent, one of the signature dish. Everything is awesome."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth the experience,1,40,8-Oct-14,"Our favourite meal in Singapore. Ever. Yes, it's expensive, but you get over it and realise you just had an out-of-body experience of raw (and perhaps blow-torched) fish. We were awed by the chef's before we even tasted the food. Then we ordered and ate. Then we told the chef to serve us whatever. It was awesome experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Memeorable Meal,1,40,3-Oct-14,"Perched above the Marina Bay Sands casino gaming tables is this small twent five seater restaurant Waku Ghin from chef Tetsuya Wakuda. Every diner will end up with there personal chef. If the sea urchin starter with prawn and caviar is on the menu then you are in for a treat, the canadian lobster was mouth watering, so was the abalone from Tasmania, the wagu beef was sublime. Waku Ghin is restauarnt that Tets always wanted where he can source the best produce from every corner of the world. Start with a martini, the beverage list is well curated, with a fine sake selection. This is a world class restaurant."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Relax, it's only food",1,40,3-Oct-14,"Highly anticipated, our visit was a little disappointing. From the hidden entrance into an almost dark room (sigh) which is way too self conscious and makes you feel like unworthy when you for stumble blindly into the nearest chair in front of a load of snobbish casino goers to the mini-restaurant rooms with 5 bar stools (err uncomfortable, I'm spending a fortune I want a chair back and not to get varicose veins) it was all a bit much. Yes some of the food was very delicious (the beef, some other stuff) but the famous sea urchin, well I literally had to gag it down. The wine pairings were good. We paid about $1800. It's too much for what it just faffed around food. Unless you are a food blogger I'd say don't bother"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Remarkable experience, everything was just perfect.",1,50,7-Sep-14,"This is my second time at a Tetsuya joint and I can honestly say that it just keeps getting better. My first experience was at Tetsuya's Sydney for my birthday and everything was just amazing! So when I heard/read that Waku Ghin was rated even higher I knew we had to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday there. Booking was done via email and the team at Waku Ghin made it very easy. There are 2 seatings every night, 5.30pm and 8.00pm. We opted for the latter and the session usually runs for a minimum of 3 hours. 10 courses in total which includes the petit fours and a dessert. There were 5 of us in attendance and it worked out to be around $672 per person including GST and drinks. We were originally planning on wine pairing but that entails 5 glasses (1 litre) per person and that was simply too much for mum and grandaunt.They don't encourage sharing as there would be an additional fee to do so. Instead, we chose 4 glasses per the sommelier's recommendation: Champagne, chilled Sake, White and Red. My dad and I highly recommend this experience as we believe it heightens the once of a kind dining experience. I have to admit I had my reservations about some of the dishes. Just by browsing a couple of reviews I could tell that the sea urchin and abalone are star/staple dishes. I'm not a big fan of either (Sea Urchin in Tsukiji Market and Abalone at various Chinese New Year functions) and I was really worried I would not fully enjoy myself!At the start of the session, each dining party is assigned a personal chef and in turn they will showcase the live array of seafood we were to consume that night. Live, because they started wriggling right in from of my eyes. Honestly, the sea urchin was mind blowing! There was no taste of the ocean nor was there any imperfections with the dish. It was silk on our tongues and fragrant on our palate. Without giving away too much, the abalone was scored thinly and cooked to perfection. The marbling on the Wagyu beef was crazy (but that was to be expected at a place like Waku Ghin) and Chef Masa barely seasoned it before lightly searing it on each side. Writing this review was harder than I thought it would be because the experience was amazing but at the same time I didn't want to give away too much. I believe there should be an element of surprise when you see fresh ingredients respected for its purity and prepared just to enhance the flavours. In essence, all 5 of us agree it was certainly an unbelievable experience and very well worth the money we paid. Also, we now view food very differently and it leaves us wanting much more."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Perfect. Sublime. Gastronomic experience,1,50,29-Aug-14,"It was a perfect night just what you would expect from Tetsuya. Yes you do need to take a morgage out to dine here but it was worth it! There was no pretentiousness at all, it felt intimate as there was only 7 of us at the table and didn't see the other guests, we had a chef all to ourselves and we had at least two wait staff. The sommelier was wonderful he made the night for us, his choices were divine especially the Pinot wine. He was so accommodation to my daughter (she's 8yo) and even picked matching drinks for her, at the end of the evening he gave us a private tour of the wine room. We also got yo go in the kitchen and have a peek which was awesome. The highlight of the night was of course the food it was so fresh and cooked just right respecting the produce. Everything was melt in your mouth delicious, perfect balance in taste. It really was a gastronomic experience. A must for any foodie. I don't understand how this could be number 50 in the worlds best restaurant list below Attica which I went to the week before (read my review). Unlike Attica the theatre was in the cooking & produce. This is what you would expect from a top restaurant and they definitely delivered. A memorable experience. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sublime beyond all expectations,1,50,24-Aug-14,"The food here is beyond anything I've experienced anywhere in the world, and yes, I've eaten a lot of places! It brings a new meaning to 'fresh' with the base flavours of the main components standing tall, but perfectly complimented by subtle, beautiful flavourings. The sea urchin is incredible. The beef tastes like you could cut it with a spoon. I am dreaming still about the chocolate truffles we finished with. The matched wines and sake were excellent, although the wines were very familiar ones for us as Australians. Unlike the previous reviewer who didn't like the 'hibachi' style seating, we were ok with that because it is still intimate and serious service. There is no Benihana style theatrics in preparation or service. When I expressed interest in the grill (which is actually a very clever induction plate not a Benihana style grill) the chef explained how it all worked and, because I was interested, took me out the back and showed me around the kitchen. Service was unobtrusive and perfectly timed. Yes, we moved to the lounge for dessert, but then lingered over some very excellent Pedro Ximinez while admiring the view, which was a lovely way to finish."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely wonderful,1,50,7-Aug-14,"This is a outraged gastronomy dinner... If you can afford it, don't miss it... Every dish is pure enjoyment and I am grateful to be invited to not one..but twice.... Both out doing one another."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best meal ever,1,50,30-Jul-14,"Absolutely the best restaurant that I have ever been to in my life. The freshest ingredients, impeccable service, and friendly staff. The uni with caviar is my favourite. Just melts in your mouth. Over the past year, I have found myself dreaming of the food at Waku Ghin since our first visit, and had to come back again and again for a quick fix. Thank you Waku Ghin, every penny spent here is well worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Like the restaurant at the end of the universe..,1,50,6-Jul-14,".. the Lobster waved before heading to its culinary execution. Proving how fresh the food was. At the start chef shows you the selection of seafood that will be served. As an Omakase meal you get what is served but as in the case of my wife they check for allergies or dislikes. The food was exceptionally prepared - here is the run down of what we had:French Gillardeau Oyster with Ginger and Rice wine Vinegar.anMarinated Botan Shrimp and Sea urchin and Oscietra Caviarslow-cooked NZ John Dory with charcoal grilled aubergineTamanian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato - mmm best Abalone I've had in Singapore and from sustainable sources from TasmaniaCharcoal grilled fillet of Tasmanian grass-fed beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi mustard (beef from Cape Grim)Ohmi Wagyu from Shiga prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy (hand grated wasabi)Somen with Myoga and JunsaiGyokuro (green tea to clear palate)Desserts: musk melon, chocolate Mousse, Petit FoursI also asked for wine pairing which was an extra 250 dollars but complimented the food nicely, includes sake. The stand out dish for me was teh sea urchin - i usually don't like and Abalone - never had a fresh one before.they also kindly made the mousse into a mini birthday cake with hand written chocolate message for my lovely wife's birthday."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb,1,50,1-Jul-14,"Words almost fail me in describing this meal. Our last meal at Waku Ghin was wonderful - hence our return visit - but in many ways this was even better. This isn't just about the fabulous food, its the whole experience; the theatre of the food being presented and cooked before your eyes, the beautiful presentation, the immaculate service and the venue. Yes it is expensive but we left feeling that it was money well spent. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than expected!,1,50,15-Jun-14,"Having tried Tetsuya's in Sydney, I knew that Waku Ghin would be nothing short of amazing, and after dining there last night, I can say that I was truly impressed with the food, service and the whole ""chef's table"" experience. It was so much better than I expected!Every dish that was placed in front of us, was cooked beautifully and presented like a work of art. Staff were attentive, but not overcrowding and all of them had a lot of knowledge about the ingredients used in the dishes. There is no denying that the price per head is costly! But what you get is a lovely 2-3 hour meal, delicious food and an amazing dining experience that Chef Tetsuya created himself."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Tour de Force,1,50,14-Jun-14,"This is an amazing restaurant with one of the best meals we have ever experienced. To start we did not love the location and the restaurant is quiet. We enjoyed our fellow guests but the seating is not for everyone. However, once the food starts to flow every bite is amazing. The quality and freshness is exceptional and everything is prepared for you in person so there is interaction with the chef. The beef was brilliant and the wine pairings perfect. We liked the change to the scenic windows for drinks and desserts and you get a chance to watch the laser light show. This is a culinary tour de force and though expensive we left feeling it was worth and it and very satiated. A must in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Miles away and miles in front of his Sydney restaurant,1,40,26-May-14,"The product that Tetsyua uses in this restaurant is quite amazing, the dishes are simple, yet they still seem to change on the 3 visits we have had. His Sydney restaurant over the years has become dull and boring, though this is where you can feel a new sense of energy in the dining private communal rooms. Everything was faultless, the abalone and wagyu courses were divine!. Only qualms I could have were the service staff seemed a little lost for such an establishment."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very Expensive,1,50,24-May-14,A beautiful meal prepared in an exceptional way. Everything was so fresh and of the best quality. The deserts were beautiful as we'll. Only problem was the price $1570 Singapore dollars was far too much for a single meal.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Yum Yum for Freshness,1,50,3-May-14,"I don't like its location, walking past the Casino to get to the restaurant didn't do that much for me, casinos aren't my thing. The restaurant is designed so that you get to sit at a counter in one of about half dozen rooms that seats probably up to about 12 people, which is nice and intimate, watching the food being cooked in front of you, I love that. Food was presented to you in its unprepared state and you were told about its origin. Each dish once cooked and served came with a full explanation of the ingredients. The freshness of the food was outstanding. Each dish was presented in such away that your taste buds were screaming out Yum Yum. For dessert you were escorted to a table that overlooked the city which was gorgeous and got to see an amazing light show, very spectacular. I loved every dish that was served to me, flavours were amazing, especially the Ohmi Wagyu, that was just delicious. You are definitely paying for the incredibly fresh ingredients, but the wine was way too expensive, over the top. Would I go back......maybe, maybe not. Service was excellent, but I would expect nothing less for the price. For similar price I personally would always return to the Tippling Club though. That's my favourite."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fabulous experience, delicious food",1,50,22-Apr-14,"This is certainly an expensive dinner, so be prepared... but if you can afford to splurge, then don't hesitate! It is a different experience than what you might expect from most restaurants. You are seated at a bar with each course being prepared in front of you. The food speaks for itself - Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar, Tasmanian Abalone with Aonori, Braised Canadian Lobster with Couscous and Tajine Spice - are a few examples and are all delicious. The Wagyu Beef course was seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted. The staff is friendly and attentive. When it comes time for desert, you are moved to a table in a different room where you are able to enjoy a nice view as you complete your meal. Do it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",best restaurant in Singapore,1,50,15-Apr-14,Awesome food and excellent service. Each course was amazing and spectacular. Much better than Tetsuya at Sydney. The chef himself was very friendly and it was a truly wonderful meal.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Japanese food,1,50,28-Mar-14,"If you are looking for delicious food - waku ghin is the one! I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fabulous Meal,1,50,20-Mar-14,"We went along on a Saturday night when staying in Singapore for the weekend.What a wonderful experience. We've been to Tetsuya's years ago and loved it. This is certainly different.You are seated in a small room at a tepanyaki bar and you have dinner with 4 others. We were forewarned about this possibility. We had a lovely couple next to us who were also celebrating a birthday. The couple on the end seemed nice enough but were a little loud and intrusive, but generally were fine.We did the set menu with the wine pairing. Staff were attentive and asked about allegies and dislikes ahead of time. FOODFabulous! It was beautifully prepared and presented. They rely on the freshness and quality of their ingredients to make the dish. And what quality they are.I actually enjoyed Abalone for the first time. We both enjoyed every dish served.WINEThe wine pairing was very good and complimented the foods brilliantly. I'm not a sake drinker so they substituted any sake pairing with a wine.STAFFFriendly, attentive and professional. Sometimes almost too efficient with the taking plates away and putting new things in front of you but it's a minor thing.DECORLiked it. It's dark but not cold. The smaller room idea is a good one. PRICEIt is expensive. It was somewhere we went as a treat. It is not somewhere you plan to go for the sake of it. Saying that though, we thought it was worth it and would do it again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Indugle in the Best,1,50,4-Mar-14,"It was for a very special dinner celebration and we have decided to choose a very restaurant to indulge and Waku Gin was our first choice and the right choice ! This is one of those spectacular restaurant that is special from the decor to the food , the service and the presentation of each dish, every aspect was perfection. As it was our first visit, we got the manager to recommend a menu for us and each dish was well recommended as they were sublime and each of these dishes went so well with the next one. The presentation of the dishes was creative, the flavours were beautiful and the ingredients were special, fresh and of top quality. Yes, it was indulgence in every sense and $$$ but it was totally worth it ! We look forward to our next visit here again. Great experience !"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A great choice in Singapore,1,50,27-Feb-14,"We went there with my husband 2 days ago and had a great experience. The food is high quality, the service is fautless, and the whole diner was really tasty.Of course this is an expensive restaurant and for a french person like me the air conditionner is way too high ( I will suggest people who are not used to air conditionner to bring a jacket or you'll be freezing). But the overall experience was really great. The beef was so tasty and tender, the abalon was great too and we were not deceived ( as it is often the case after a good meal) by the desserts that were a perfect ending to this great evening.The sommelier is french, and gave us good advice for the choice of the Sake ( they have such a great choice of Sake in this restaurant).We really enjoyed our diner at Waku Ghun and for sure we will come back."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant,1,50,29-Jan-14,"We have eaten at tetsuyas in Sydney a few times and haven't really thought it was phenomenal, but I can honestly say that Waku Ghin was fantastic. Yes it is expensive and yes there is not that much food, but my oh my it is clever and inventive and tasty. Sitting at a table watching a chef prepare the food was magical as he explained where the produce came from and why different ingredients were used. It's what we thought momofuku would be and wasn't. Brilliant seafood and excellent service. Definitely highly recommended by us! Domo arigato Suzuki san."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",It is THE best restaurant I've ever been to.,1,50,28-Jan-14,"The like 15 course menu was absolutely delicious, in a private room with our own chef. He was enjoying our company because my hubby and I like tasting new things all the time. Everything was exquisite! Very pricey, but so worth it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb japanese at astronomical prices,1,50,8-Jan-14,"If you happen to be in Singapore, and you happen to gamble, and you happen to win BIG, then go to Waku Ghin! Upon entry you are guided to a small room with bar stools and a teppanyaki grill, seated down and introduced to the chefs (if you're friendly then you'll also meet the three or four other diners in the room). After asking about allergies and dietary requirements, the chef will then display the nights offerings (most of which are likely to jump at you). The most memorable dish for me was the abalone. It was cooked to perfection, and required no sides - this is surprising considering my hatred for abalone!The only disappointment was the Uni (the only other food that i have never enjoyed). Having said that, this was the best that i've had so far - outside of japan, and the combination of flavours with the saltiness of the caviar was excellent. I would definately recommend this restaurant. An added bonus was that our chef was extremely amusing and very charismatic, only adding to the experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Extraordinarily expensive, but extraordinarily good",1,50,8-Dec-13,"I've had the good fortune to dine at Urazawa and Masa and view Waku Ghin as in that elite company. Of course it's excellent and fresh, what elevates a place (for me at least) is the uniqueness of flavor profiles, combinations and presentations. This place has them. You look forward to each new course and are often wowed. I wouldn't pay to do any of these places twice, but I don't regret splurging on this once."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",I had a great dinner at this restaurant.,1,40,23-Nov-13,"After reading reviews on TA, we decided to have dinner at Waku Ghin. I was impressed by seafood of this restaurant. Ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Dishes were cooked excellent and beautiful presented. Price was reasonable. Staff was professional. These things made this place have a luxurious and romantic ambiance. I had a great dinner at here. Highly recommend. I will get back if I have a chance to visit Singapore again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional Quality,1,50,14-Nov-13,"Anytime you are looking for guaranteed high quality and delicious food - count Waku Ghin among your options. I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great sea food!,1,50,10-Oct-13,"All of their seafood was so delicious, very fresh. Especially their signature Sea urchin: it looked tough outside with all those spikes, but inside, it was sweet and tender. The service, for sure, was great. The view at night was amazing too."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Surprised Indulgence!,1,40,5-Oct-13,"Tucked at the 2nd floor just above the smoke-filled Marina Bay Sands Casino the discreet door led us to this exquisite fine dining of modern European-Japanese cuisine. As guests of a surprised birthday gift specially planned by a very thoughtful hubby for his wife with some of her good old friends, we savoured the signature marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar, and Wagyu with Wasabi and Citrus Soy, the superb birthday chocolate mousse cake and lobster in the 10-course degustation menu. They are very good with a very deep pocket! Go all the way with a special room overlooking Marina Bay for a spectacular view of the daily 8 and 10 pm laser shows! Memorable indulgence with good friends! Thanks for a lovely evening!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Use here for important date or business dinner. Successful.,1,50,25-Sep-13,"You will definitely falling love with the food and ambience. Excellent service, perfect foods and wine. Timing of serving food is also great. I have nothing to complain.If you go there for business dinner with your client, you will definitely close the deal.If you go for dating, she will be impressed by you. They will serve you only course menu like 9 courses. Beautiful presentation.What you pay is what you get. Be prepared for the bill."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent food - once in a lifetime must try!,1,40,23-Aug-13,I celebrated my special surprise birthday dinner here with my husband back in May 2011. The fusion Japanese fine dining restaurant has a very nice view of Marina Bay at night and a romantic ambience! The food was delicious and unforgettable although it took him at least 3 months in advance to book the table!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic food . Outstanding service,1,50,22-Jul-13,This Restaurent is a must if you like to be adventures with your food. You cannot complain it is expensive cause it is worth every penny that you are charged !! My 13 year old loved the sea urchin signature dish and ordered it twice !! Long live Tatsuya and all his great staff 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really Remarkable - but very expensive,1,50,16-Jul-13,"Having enjoyed Tetsuya in Sydney - we were very pleased to find Waku Ghin in Singapore. Although still a restaurant run by the same chef/owner, the overall experience was completely different. While we knew it was going to be expensive, especially with the matched wine course - we were very surprised when the bill arrived. We do not research the prices before picking a place - because we may financially talk ourselves out of a great experience. This was a very good experience, but the 1600USD for dinner for two with wine felt a little more than over the top. Each course was extraordinary, building flavors and textures at each pass. The chef we had was very engaging - but not overly involved in our experience - which i appreciated. We also did not engage in any way with the couple in our room. In hindsight, knowing what we paid - I am happy not to have shared the night with strangers - maybe I am anti-social - but this is truely a once in a very long while type of experience. I am surprised to read that the menu does not change much - our chef indicated that Tetsuya is in residence at least once a month for several days. If I were to repeat the meal and have the same meal - I would be very disappointed. The signature dishes (Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato) were incredible, as was the shaved kobe beef. Our timing was very good - as we were able to watch the early 9pm(ish) light show at MBS. I was surprised to be charged 10SIN for an expresso at the end - felt like being nickeled after spending 1.6 thousand...... I would not repeat - but would recommend to friends for a very special experience. There are many Michelin-star restaurants that are equal or better for much better value. I will though always return to Tetsuya in SYD - each and every trip."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Surprisingly Asian,1,50,11-Jul-13,"The restaurant is very expensive, at the first glance. But when you try the food you understand that it's really worth visiting and trying. Traditional courses but all with some special flavor. Direct contact with chef and observation over the cooking process makes it very intimate. If I visit Singapore, I ll have second try."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Add a touch of personalized service and creativity please,1,40,27-Jun-13,"At $500 (USD$400) for a 10 course degustation menu, the entire experience is expected to be comfortable and unforgettable. The relative high quality with the high price is a given. Therefore I am sorry that I was not that impressed with the dishes compared to other Michelin-star restaurants I have visited around the world. I wish that after repeating the same menu for almost three years there could be some innovations in presentation, some seasonalities of ingredients and some surprises in taste. And perhaps a more permanent chef since it is not realistic to expect the present of Mr Tetsuya. While I still enjoy the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato, I have also discovered many attractive alternatives that offer equally great good outside the prestigious casino with genuine warm service. However, Waku Ghin is still a place to impress someone, given all the publicities the establishment had received."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great for biz and first date to impress.,1,50,28-May-13,"My 2nd time here. The service is top notch. The service staff are ever attentive. The quality of food is at its finest and freshest. Brought my partner for a date and order a bottle of champagne, bill came up to SGD$1224, 10 course meal. Book in advance and u are expected to leave ur credit card details to them via a fax or email. With the understanding if u fail to cancel the reservation 1-2 days advance, $400++ per head will be deducted off ur card."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant WorldWide for me for the time being ...,1,50,28-May-13,"Of course I didn't try all restaurants, but I tried many! And I don't give many feedback... This is slightly overpriced, with the wine it is around 700 SGD per person, but the 6 or 8 times I had dinner was an excpetional experience!Their flagship dish is so expetionaly good that I made it my profile picture!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great Chef. Great Food.,1,50,9-May-13,"We were there to celebrated our 10th anniversary and the chef was very nice in giving us a specially made cake for the occasion. The food, though tiny in portion, was big in gastronomic experience! Love everything they served. Can't wait to go there again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience,1,50,8-May-13,"Be prepared for a gastronomic feast. What a lovely evening we had there. The food was stunning, the staff outstanding and the attention to detail in the ambience of the place made the whole evening memorable. The chef's signature dishes were amazing. I was the only vegetarian person in the group and that certainly did not cause any issues at all and the soup of avocado with potato ice cream and tonburi at the start sent me to heaven straight away! Make sure you book as that is the only way you can guarantee a table."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fantastic teppanyaki-omakase dining, the best in Singapore.",1,50,13-Apr-13,"We ate at Waku Ghin in early April - my wife, 10yo daughter and I. Enough has been said here about the nature of the food already - it's exquisite, and the local, Tetsuya-trained chef at your table will not disappoint. All courses will be memorable, but for me the grilled Tasmanian abalone was just divine. They were great with our daughter, and she shaved the wasabi for the table with the chef who was warm, attentive and personable in a way that we've rarely seen here. There are staff aplenty quietly swarming behind you to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and the service is of a very high standard. At the end of the meal, you're escorted into the dessert room, an elevated, large glass-windowed space of tables from which you view the light show at the Marina (a little reminiscent of Quay in Sydney). By this stage, I was only able to manage coffee and petit fours, having been wonderfully and cheerfully fed some of the world's best food. Expensive, but I'd happily recommend this as easily the best possible restaurant experience in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","""Very Posh Nosh"" at an Exceptional Restaurant",1,50,11-Apr-13,"A fabulous experience, one not to be missed. Tetsuya's Singapore restaurant is amazing, the service is perfect, your meal is prepared by your own private chef on a high tech teppanyaki grill, and the food is absolutely amazing. 10 courses which were the perfect size so not overly full at the end of the meal. Sea Urchin, Wagyu Beef, Lobster, and more, just fabulous. After dinner, coffee taken in a lounge area, along with dessert wine and Petit Fours overlooking Marina Bay and the last laser light show of the night. An exceptional evening, with a price tag to match."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special dining experience,1,50,9-Apr-13,"Eating at Waku Ghin was truly a memorable evening for me and my wife. Firstly, this was a meal to celebrate our marriage just a few days ago. Also Tetsuya is my culinary idol (unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to meet him as he has never been at his restaurants each time I have dined) and we were going to Singapore as a stopover on our honeymoon, so Waku Ghin was a perfect excuse to splurge on a mind blowing meal.The service here is top notch, you get your own private chef, and the food is absolutely amazing (as the restaurant sources only the finest ingredients in the world). Truly one of the best meals I have ever had! For detailed review of Waku Ghin, please see the following link:http://foodmab.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/waku-ghin-singapore-15-june-2011.html"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Cannot be better,1,50,7-Apr-13,"Hard to understand the some mixed assessments of this extraordinary place. WakuGhin really deserves to be among the highest evaluted gastronomique places in the world. Five minutes in walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands, take the way thru the gallery of the casino (impressive), you enter a world which first reminds you on a simple teppanyaki grill. To a certain extent it has similarities, but what and how the food is prepared and presented is a class on its own. You must choose the menu, which is worth every cent, starting with unforgettable Gillardeau oysters, a Sea urchin, which cannot be better in Sicily, a fillet of Tasmanian Grass-Feed Beef, which for us won against the Wagyu and, and ..... Just order and let surprise yourselves, you won't forget the evening. And talk to the sommelier or to the well experienced service staff. If you like Pinots ask for what is not on the wine list. We had the recommended Ontago Burn Cottage, a dream to this menu, so the second bottle was a must."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",very good but also very expensive,1,40,3-Apr-13,"Like many fine dining places in Singapore, the fitout is top notch, the service is faultless and the quality of food is usually very good. all these qualities were evident when dining at Waku Ghin. the food was delicious and very theatrical watching them prepare it all on the hot plate in front of you. the produce is fresh and the uni dish is amazing. however, there is a big price tag that comes with it. having dined at Tetsuya's in Sydney, i think it is a lot better value for money and i left feeling very full. i was not fully satisfied when leaving Waku Ghin. albeit a very different style menu at Tetsuya's compared to Waku Ghin, i prefer his original restaurant in Sydney."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",It's all about the ingredients,1,40,30-Mar-13,"This is a quite unique dining concept. You're showing into small rooms, each with its own teppanyaki-style grill and a chef assigned to you cooks the various dishes from the tasting menu in front of you. There's some exotic and expensive ingredients here but the flavours are surprisingly subtle - too subtle for my liking. Once you're through with the savoury courses, it's into the main room overlooking the CBD for the evening light show across the water and the dessert courses. It's an enjoyable experience but definitely in the special occasion basket because it's quite expensive. The individual rooms, when there's only a few people in attendance feel a little cold and strange but it's nice to be able to chat to the chef."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing,1,50,23-Mar-13,"I walked to the restaurant through MBS and did not expect to find such a perfect restaurant in the casino. We went as the big group of 9, sake Jumnai Daiginjo was very good beyond our expectation. Great food and warm service."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hard to believe there are 62 better in Singapore~,1,50,23-Mar-13,"I was fortunate to first eat at Testuya's establishment in Rozelle, Sydney.Along with the local chilli crab, eating here was to be one of the highlights of a five day eating jaunt with a girlfriend for our respective birthdays.She has never eaten Testuya's food, but as a chef is well versed as to his creativity and notoriety ...she was blown away !Fortunately, once inside the calming environs one easily forgets you are on the 2nd floor of a casino.The private dining room was a haven.The staff friendly, efficient.. special mention must go to our 'private chef' Kaz, also formerly of Sydney who was most engaging both about the fare we were about to consume and local tips !{ Thank you, we took your advice and went the next day for lunch ~was worth getting wet in the afternoon thunderstorm}The next few hours was hynagogic.Whether it was the enlarged 'golf ball' in my scotch tumbler, to the simple but superb crockery the evening was sublime.No need to describe the ingredients..sourced world wide.Being asked whether any allergies or dislikes is welcomed..it would be dismal to waste any of the ten courses that one is about to indulge.The combinations presented were visually enticing...and tasted even better.With an excellent wine list and some great martinis the evening was worth the flight from Melbourne.I was fortunate to explore the cellar after dinner..it was akin to a library, with bottles from every conceivable wine producing nation.Dessert with a view, the BEST(must be an Australian barista) coffee in all of Singapore and conversation with fellow guests from Venezuela and Israel, completed a food experience second to none.Is it cheap ? Of course not. If however, one is ‘in’ to food and the experience of dining like this, it is affordable gratification.Enjoy."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing experience...,1,50,18-Mar-13,"The most amazing gillardeau oysters, they are the creme de la creme of the oyster world... The trout is to die for! And the seafood salad a great sashimi plate. This was just the bar menu you have to go here....!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mesmerizing Moment of Magic,1,50,7-Mar-13,"A birthday meal befitting of a royalty. Before the meal, I was rather skeptical, thinking that Waku Ghin is going to be like all those over-rated celebrities' chef restaurants; form over substance. But Wak Ghin is nothing less than spectacular.We arrived early were seated comfortably in the classy bar area. A sweet fruity white wine was introduced to whet my appetite and I was instantly swooning in delight upon the first sip. It was thus natural to get a whole bottle, which was extremely satisfying and lasted us through the 10 course gastronomic extravaganza~The dinner started off with the friendly wait-staff guiding us to a spacious 4 dinner Teppanyaki room, whereby cheerful chefs greeted us with an impressive array of precious seafood in a wooden box. It was not long before the chef started to perform his magic through transforming these fresh foods into divine dishes that were simply irresistible. We had uni, snapper, lobster, caviar, wagyu, abalone just to name a few. And they are all insanely delectable. The dessert was refreshing and unique, something I would crave for after a while...All in the all, Waku Ghin is a gourmet's dream come true. Since life's selection of tantalizing experiences are far and few, Wak Ghin is certainly one that is not to be missed."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the most fantastic dining experience in Asia,1,50,20-Feb-13,"Waku Ghin offers a 10-course degustation menu with a private chef to prepare each dish in front of you to delight your senses. The restaurant offers modern European-Japanese Cuisine with the finest ingredients. We have come here on many occasions and each time we have enjoyed the service and the food. The consistency in execution is to be well-commended.This time round we started the course with the Oysters, Royale with Ginger & Rice Vinegar and Gillardeau with Lemon.Followed by Waku Ghin's signature dish Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin & Oscietra Caviar. The varying textures combined with the balance of sweet, fresh & saltiness of the caviar was done to perfection. This dish makes me want to dine here again & again.We were then served the John Dory from New Zealand with Roasted Eggplant. This fish was slow cooked in a pan rather than a water bath to keep the fish's freshness. It was moist but still can smell a hint of Smokiness.The steamed Alaskan King Crab with Lemon Scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil was perfectly done. The Alaskan King Crab was placed on a bed of sea salt which water was poured to steam the crab. The result was a perfectly cooked Alaskan King Crab leg which was juicy and tender.We always enjoyed the Australian Abalone with Fregola & Tomato. The basil leaves & tomato was a perfect combination with the abalone which was cooked on a hot plate. The tanginess worked so well with the freshness of the abalone.This was followed by another decadent dish of Braised Canadian Lobster with White Miso. The lobster was cooked perfectly. You wouldn’t usually match lobster with white miso but it works beautifully since the white miso brings out the sweetness of the lobster.The main event was the Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Cape Grim Beef. Cooked medium rare, this fine piece of beef is juicy, very little fat but has enormous flavours. Even by itself it is packed full of flavour and when complemented with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard it is a match made in heaven.Our Sampi Pasta dish was a special request we made. The pasta was cooked Al Dente and then covered in Scampi Oil. The Sampi Oil is made by the restaurant from grape seed oil (healthy!) and the reduction of many kilos of scampi heads and shells. It takes a lot of effort to make a very small amount and it smells and tastes Great!!!We finished the savoury dishes with our favourite tea Gyokuro served at 40C to clean the palate.The desserts at Waku Ghin have improved since we were there 1 year ago especially by bringing in the Spanish Dessert Chef from Santos. This time round our pre-dessert was Cold Soup of Strawberry with Lychee Granita & Coconut Ice-Cream. The extremely light pre-dessert was well balanced with the sourness of the strawberries, sweetness of the lychee and the coconut flavour.The Ghin Cheese Cake was light and airy. The cream consistency along with the lemon flavours was a great dessert which wasn’t too heavy.Our Finale was the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Vanilla Ice-Cream & Macadamias. The mousse was light & airy but still kept the decadent chocolate flavour.We even enjoyed the Petit Fours especially the Matcha Truffle & the Chocolate with Mandarin Cream. Spending SGD 400 per person is quite pricey but all worth it!!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Worth every cent (all 120,000 of them!)",1,50,16-Feb-13,"Despite its setting above a casino, Waku Ghin is one of the finest dining experiences I've had, ever, period: Ambiance. Service. Cuisine. On arrival, we saddled up to the bar for a quick drink. In response to my girlfriend's request for ""something fruity and sweet,"" the bartender thought for a brief moment before whipping up a delicious blended-blueberry something. There was alcohol in it, to be sure. But we couldn't tell what it was. A perfect drink.Dinner was prepared before us, teppanyaki style, by a single chef who tended to us for the duration of the meal. He was charming and engaging without being overbearingly chatty. Our ten courses included the following: (I missed a few items here, to be sure, as the sake flowed on... see full menu in pic below)- yellow tail- sea urchin- ocean trout with seaweed- abalone with rocket and Fregula pasta from Sardinia - lobster with bisque and tarragon - Tasmanian grass fed tenderloin aged 90 days with rocket and wasabi mustard- New Zealand red snapper- Mont Blanc with vanilla ice creamAll of it fresh and beautifully presented, yet simple: no foam bubbles anywhere to be seen! We washed ours down with a bottle of cold sake and some sparkling water. Waku Ghin is not cheap. But the (master) chef has earned his reputation and, in this case, does not fail to deliver once again. Bring your wallet and a healthy appetite! (oh and a shawl or wrap: the Aircon is quite strong!)"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food,1,40,12-Feb-13,"Great food for a special occasion. The chef was able to accommodate to some special diet requirements e.g. No beef, etc. Dessert was served in a lounge overlooking the bay offering a fascinating view. On exit, one gets a even more fascinating view of all the filled up gaming tables at the lower floors!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Something different,1,50,8-Jan-13,"This restaurant is something for a very special occasion. It is very expensive but the tasting menu (you cannot order anything else) is excellent. The dishes are prepared in front of you and the ingredients are shown beforehand. From abalone, via sea urchin, soups, lobster and steak - there is something for everybody. Also special requests are catered today without any issues. The dessert is then presented in a special room from where you have a view on the marina. I really enjoyed the experience but the prices are a all the way up there."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Number 39 in the World,1,50,8-Jan-13,"This restaurant offers a dining experience which is comparable only with the best. It is the 39th Best Restaurant in the World and the experience here is world class. We have eaten at many Michellin rated restaurants in France and the UK and this restaurant by Tetsuya Wakuda more than holds it own. The meal opens with each couple having a chef working opposite in teppanyaki style, four people to a room. There the tepanyaki resemblance ends, the chef discussing each dish and presenting it with matching wines on a degustation basis. After 9 courses with matching wines, one proceeds to the open section of the restaurant to enjoy two delicious desserts followed by coffee or tea and petit fours.We were lucky enough to meet Tetsuya in the kitchen after our meal and this was really the meal of a lifetime. Try it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A such expensive but services and foods are good enough,1,50,4-Jan-13,"First time to try this restaurant according to #39 of World best restaurant , overall impressive and good job Since arrived the restaurant , warm and polite welcome greeting that I can feel , Atmostphere very good as a fine dinning restaurant should be Chef table price truly expensive , but the quality of food material were good , nice presentation and explanation of every course they served , one private table only serve guest more than 6 ppl which privately Foods so tastely and high quality , the beverages were so expensive as well , couldn't find a cheap one , then I had to ordered almost cheapest one Sake 165 SGD (75ml)However , the overall of that night was enjoy and unforgettable"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent for that special occasion,1,50,2-Jan-13,"The uni (sea urchin) with caviar and crab meat is out of this world. This is their signature dish. The other dishes are all similarly very good. It is slightly pricey though, at around S$500 a person without wine, that is around US$ 400 a person. But for that special occasion, birthday, anniversary, I think it is worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Truly amazing,1,50,23-Dec-12,"From the get go it was a sublime experience.The dining experience is very much ingredient focussed. A lot of places these days lay claim to being just that.Waku Ghin however is the true mascot of that philosophy ""Ingredient Focussed"".The pairing that was recommended and organised by Mr. Francesco ""Flamboyance"" Galdeano was spot on for every course.A truly excellent experience overall.Will be back the next time I am in town.Kudos to Chef Kok who was our chef for the evening. He was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than Tetsuya in Sydney,1,50,11-Dec-12,"Having dined at Tetsuya’s in Sydney, my husband and I had high expectations for Waku Ghin.Waku Ghin offers an exquisite 10-course degustation menu created from some of the best seasonal produce imported from Japan and Australia. We absolutely loved the Japanese and European flavours and were completely blown away by the food. To some extent, we actually prefer Waku Ghin over Tetsuya's. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some very good recommendations from their extensive wine list.Guests are seated in front of a teppanyaki bar and the food is prepared right in front of your eyes by the chef. Our favourite dish was none other than the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar which was just sensational. The ocean trout, pigeon and the wagyu beef were also superb. We're rather surprised to read the negative reviews. In our opinion, Waku Ghin is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore and the world even. Sure it's expensive but the dining experience including the food, presentation and service is unparalleled. Our only complaint is that the restaurant decor lacks imagination but then again, you're there for the food not the furniture."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya - you never let us down! Waku Ghin is the BEST dining experience in Singapore...,1,50,12-Oct-12,"We enjoyed our first Tetsuya experience in his Sydney restaurant for our anniversary in December. My partner surprising me for my birthday last week with a trip to Singapore and a booking at Tetsuya's latest venture - Waku Ghin. Waku Ghin is completely unique - I understand why there are so many varying reviews.Those seeking a sublime culinary dining ""experience"" will love it... those seeking anything else will walk away disappointed.Yes, it is expensive... but the quality service and food surpasses anything you will find in a swanky French restaurant. It's simple really - if you're not willing to pay, don't make the booking!Waku Ghin offers a set degustation menu, with 3 couples (6 guests) seated around a teppanyaki bar, interacting with their own personal chef throughout the evening. It is a rare occasion for a chef to show you the food he is preparing and cooking for you, let alone telling you the secrets of how he is doing it!I find the reports of food poisoning hard to believe. The food is fresh... so fresh in some occasions it is still alive when presented to the chef in front of you. Seafood and meat from Australia is flown in every 2 - 3 days.Highlights of our meal included the signature dish - sea urchin and caviar - which was a complete taste sensation, and the Cape Grim beef - we have never, and probably will never again, enjoy steak as tender and tasty as that piece of meat.THANK YOU Tetsuya for another very special evening... you're doing Australia proud!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive,1,40,10-Oct-12,"My husband and I had three days in Singapore and didn't want to miss Waku Ghin. We were impressed with the attentive but discreet service. Staff were friendly when we initiated conversation. The decor is stark but not too cold. All of the food was impressive. The presentation of fresh seafood in a crate before preparation was a nice touch. We requested and received a tour of the immaculate kitchen. We were lucky to enjoy a laser show over the bay while enjoying dessert. We were offered extra petite fours and couldn't resist. Don't miss the coffee. All in all a brilliant experience but I do think it's overpriced. We knew what it was going to cost before-hand so weren't surprised. The bill was $1200 for two people including a glass of champagne, one of wine, a bottle of wine and extra petite fours (don't know if this cost extra). The personalised menu to take home was a lovely touch. I would recommend this restaurant to others for a special occasion."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya back at his brilliant best!,1,50,9-Oct-12,"Yes, it is very expensive (SG$400 per head), however it both met and in some cases surpassed our expectations. It has been a while since we have been to Tetsuya’s Sydney restaurant and we always found the food to be a mix of good and great dishes. At Waku Ghin we are at another level, the food is absolutely fantastic. The regional emphasis of the food here is Japanese rather that Australian. The whole experience is taken to a new level with the “private” kitchen and dining room for all courses up to desert. Your chef for the night prepares and cooks most of the courses in front of you, providing commentary on what is being prepared, where it comes from and answers any questions. Our chef was a young Malaysian from Melaka, he was happy to explain each dish as he prepared it.The signature dish, Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar was a triumph – my partner, never one to be too experimental with food is now a convert to both Sea Urchin and Oscietra.With the exception of the Abalone (a food that has never caught our imagination) we thought the whole meal was fantastic. Our dishes included Pan fried Ayu (fish) with Daikon and Fennel, Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon, Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass Beef (Cape Grimm) with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard and Japanese Ohmi Wagu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy.Green tea called Gyokuro is the final course before you move to the more relaxed desert lounge. The excellent deserts (Soup of Strawberry with Lychee and Coconut and Ghin Cheesecake) is follow by generous quantities of devine Petit Fours with tea or coffee.Given our experience on this visit, it is very likely that we will be back the next time we are in Singapore.Highly recommended for a unique, fabulous and memorable meal."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special night out,1,50,4-Oct-12,"We had a night out at Waku Ghin on the 23rd of September 2012 for my husband's 39th birthday, We had 5 guests so we fitted around the teppinyaki style table easily. It was a bit awkward at first as there was no music and as we were all sitting next to each other, table conversation was difficult. We all soon forgot about this however when our chef came out and introduced himself. This guy was amazing, he answered all our questions (believe me, there were A LOT) all the while preparing us an array of beautiful dishes. The food was excellent, I tried a few things that I hadn't before (which is rare as we eat out a lot). The food was very different to Tetsuya's Sydney restaurant, much more Japanese in style.We were lukcy enough to get a tour of the pristine kitchen before we made our way to the ''dessert room'' for another 3 courses of desserts (one was a birthday cake surprise...) along with coffee, tea and petit fours (and in our case a beautiful bottle of dessert wine)Yes it is expensive but the attention to detail and service is worth it. The staff even cleaned and boxed up our abalone shells after the meal so we could take them home with us to Australia, nothing was too much trouble.An unforgettable experience"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dangerously expensive but unforgettable,1,50,28-Sep-12,"Clear some space on your credit card and don't miss this on your stop in Singapore.This is a dining experience like no other, its like having a very personal fancy dinner party, in your own flashy kitchen,(if you had one;)with a world class chef.If you have been to Tetsuyas in Sydney then you must go here....We had 5 guests, which was perfect to fit in one of the smaller rooms around the teppen. We had a really cool chef with a great sense of humour who explained everything and answered all our, I'm sure, tedious questions! But this guy was AMAZING, we wanted to know everything he was doing!The 10 courses sound like a lot but the food is light, yet still multi faceted. There is no choice with food except dietary requirements, to which they are very obliging. So some things may not be what you would normally order, but it's all about the ingredient experience rather than eating for hunger.Everything is prepared with great precision and care and fastidious order and cleanliness you would expect from Japanese fine dining. These chefs take their craft very seriously. Truly something to be witnessed. The service from all staff was impeccable as it should be in a place like this.We were very lucky to be given a tour of the large kitchen, before our desert courses. It was like an immaculate surgery. Just amazing.The only weird thing about this place is there is no music. Makes you kind of feel like you are there before its opened. Would be nice for some atmosphere. A big Thankyou to the staff at Tetsuyas Waku Ghin for making a birthday celebration one to remember."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great restaurant experience in Singapore.,1,50,20-Sep-12,My wife and I are big fans of tetsuyas in Sydney so deliberately stopped over in Singapore to experience this.The food was divine and it is a great dining experience. 10 courses over a few hours finishing with dessert in the dessert room.We will definitely go back next time ee are in Singapore.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",WOW,1,50,3-Sep-12,4 of us were lucky enough to eat here on August 22. Amazing food / staff. We had KAZ as our chef. Great young man and very knowledgeable re the food etc. If l could afford to eat here once a month l would. One off experience.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive as advertised but well worth the visit,1,50,3-Sep-12,"Access was tricky, lifts behind Hermes. We had our own room which served 4 and our own chef to prepare in front of us, modern teppanyaki style. The uni and cavier was exquisite, out of this world, the abalone presentation was also understanding. The fish was delicate but the three servings of beef was one too many, each was wonderful but come the 3rd sliver, the experience was waning. The food service was excellent and the chefs engaging but we had limited interaction with anyone other than those directly serving us.All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner we will remember for the food and the company. You can't enjoy this except for really special occassions, which I will look forward to again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Heavenly and fresh,1,40,31-Aug-12,"I don't know if there is a fish market just behind this restaurant.... but all i can say is. -->>>WOW<<<--. The ingredients were super super super fresh! Did i forget to say super super super? :) I frequent very high end Japanese restaurants all over the world that serve really fresh seafood but this place presents one of the tastiest i have ever tried in my entire life. In terms of creativity.... they are just one step below Iggy's. However, with every bite/spoon i take, it leaves me wanting for more. So much that i had to ask my mom and sister in law for their serving!! Thank God, women eat too little hehe. The dinner was a 10-11 course degustation but it felt like a 5 course one sigh..... that's probably why most reviewers here rate the value 3 to 4 stars only. One of the last dishes served in this place was the A5. For those who have no clue of what it is, its a sirloin steak (actually they serve strips only since its so expensive) that's very very lean but can beat any Wagyu's softness if it had the same proportion or thickness. The interiors are also a step down from Hongkong's L'ATELIER de Joël Robuchon. However, you'll be amazed with the Teppan table. It was spotless! You'll find out how they keep it in mint condition when you go there. For those thinking of bringing a date, i suggest you eat somewhere else. The degustation here is like a tour. When we came here, we had to wait in the ""lobby"" while they were preparing the room. Once we finished with dinner, we were led to another location within the restaurant for dessert and coffee. The moving about wouldn't help if you and your special other were into a very intimate and long conversation. There's just too many interruptions especially with the teppanyaki guy/ sou chef doing his cooking. Overall, i would say this is the place to be when you want to surprise your friends or family who have the budget and have no clue of what's in here. I'd probably be willing to visit this place again if i have the money or not really that hungry. If all else fails, I'm going to McDonald's afterwards haha."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tepanyaki 2.0,1,50,30-Aug-12,"If you like (superfresh - oysters, lobster etc all are shown to you still alive) seafood this is the place to be in Singapore! But also for supertender wagyu beef. A 10 course (set)diner without being completely stuffed, some courses come from the kitchen but most are made on the tepanyaki in your private dining room. I didn't get the course after having had beef going back to a fishsoup but that's the only negative comment i can thinking off. Desert in a seperate room with comfy chairs. A great (yet expensive) experience and should you have any cash left hit the casino one floor below but better is to top it off with a digestive and a great view over Singapore in the skybar KuDeTa - all at Marina Bay Sands. You will enjoy it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Tetsuya Masterpiece with wonderful staff,1,50,3-Aug-12,"A great restaurant that is pricey but is a dining experience with wonderful friendly respectful and knowledgeable staff. We had a great meal that will be remembered for quite some time, but even better was the conversations with the sommelier and the restaurant manager. Thank you for a great evening.Our only negative is that we were told to gain access to the restaurant through the casino. This was a big mistake as you are constantly having your passport checked and the passport is a smokey smelly noisy place that is not of the quality of the restaurant"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Set expectation before going: novel open kitchen dining concept, not so good for intimate dining",1,40,10-Jul-12,"It was a dinner for a real special occasion. For a dinner that is more than S$500 per person without wine, I had expected the dining experience to have sent my spouse and I to the stars and back. The food is undoubtedly imaginatively executed and tasted fabulous at every dish. 5 stars for food quality. We were not sure we got value for our buck though. That is very subjective matter especially if trying to compare amongst restaurants in this end of the spectrum. As for the atmosphere, we did not enjoy sitting on a high chair (uncomfortable for thighs and lower back) at a open teppanyaki table with 2 other couples throughout dinner , and the conversations are audible to everyone else at the table. Maybe we are more conservative. Maybe it was also how sound travels around a small room and across a stainless steel surface. If you are planning on having a dinner where you can also enjoy your private couple space for intimate conversations then this dining concept may not be for you. It is a matter have having the correct expectations. Overall, it was a great meal and memorable creativity, however I do not think I will come back again for a while until the dining concept is tweaked."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Most Amazing Dining Experience!!,1,50,28-May-12,"Most incredible dining experience....every course was special...the sea urchin was super....as was the alaskan lobster....the teppanyaki chef was proffessional and charismatic...every course had me feeling that it was unique and flavourful and the best so far...until the next one came along!!!And just when we thought it cdnt get any better...we were ushered into the desert salon for more amazing delights....even the petit four was divine...in spite of the steep prices, I cant recommend it highly enough...I wd do it all over again in a heartbeat!!The stunning ambience and fabulous wine selection doesnt hurt either!!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Singapore is a must after Tets Sydney restaurant,1,50,18-May-12,"I have experienced Tet's restaurant back in the hay days when he was on the other side of the bridge in a very small funky restaurant and he was a master of degerstation menu back then. When he moved over the bridge to Sydney CBD you knew that Tetsuya was becoming famous for his dining experience. So with our trip to Singapore last year we quickly booked a spot at Waku Ghin as it is a massive wait. So book well ahead. WOW it was the most incredible experience and meal ever. 10 courses and a take home box of truffles. I do not eat meat, so I was looked after well and my partner so did enjoy his 2 meat dishes and commented best ever meat dishes. The wine list is so extensive and the cost of alcohol is not cheep at all in Singapore and it was a night we were happy just to eat and enjoy the journey. It is not a cheap night out, so do take the cheque book as much more than the Sydney restaurant. But if you are a fan of Tet's then it is a must do at Singapore. You are so well looked after and it is so personal, that no one can beat what Waku Ghin does, well not found any better as yet. The ambience is an experience also."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Perfection,1,50,30-Mar-12,"Our visit to Waku Ghin was unplanned, and having failed to reserve tables at Tetsuya's in Sydney several time, to be able to reserve a table at such a short notice was a good start. We were led to a private cubicle and the Maitre d'hotel started asking if there was any ingredient we were not consuming that night and if we liked some drinks to start with.The restaurant feels very private and classy, but not too extravagantly luxurious. We had 10 different course of the Best French Japanese Fusion Meals. Every course was both mouth-and-eye-watering, each perfectly portioned. Scallop, Sea Urchin with oscietre caviar, Bamboo Clam, Ayu with braised withlof, Abalone with fregola,Blackmore Wagyu and Tasmanian truffles were served in order. Each course has its own distinct taste and blend and with each course, the excitement just grows. To add to the excitement, Mr. Tetsuya himself came in to greet and accompany us, he explained briefly about the motive behind his first move outside Australia. Such a great gesture from the connoisseur. Surely this was easily one of the best culinary journey we have ever experienced. We had several good drinks to accompany the perfect meals including Gyokuro, the unique Japanese green tea made from selected young green tea leaves, Masuizumi, unpasteurized Junmai Ginjo made specially for Tetsuya's, Yalumba Viognier and 2001 Torbreck Grenach. To wind up the already a wonderful dinner, we were brought to a common area overlooking the Singapore Marina Bay where fireworks happened to be in display with Singapore skyline as the backdrop. Granita of Kyoho Grapes, Cheesecakes and petit four are served as desserts. Perfect Finish.The whole experience was considerably expensive, outrageously expensive by Singapore standard some may say but well worth it if it were for a special occasion. It is still a good value otherwise in my opinion. An example of culinary perfection and I would gladly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fabled gastronomic journey."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in the World,1,50,17-Mar-12,"The best restaurant in the world, The best wine and dining experience to go with it.Tetsuya is the maestro now he has his dream orchestra. Beautiful design with the freshest ingrediants from all over the world cooked to perfection in front of you, Bellismo. Dom Perignon to go with the Cold asparagus and Oscietre Caviar then the Marinated Botan Ebi with se urchin and Oscietre caviar.That is just the first two courses.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular food and spectacular view in Singapore,1,50,21-Feb-12,"I had to email to get a reservation beforehand and the restaurant is not that easy to find. However, the meal there was spectacular and on par with the 3 Michelin starred restaurants in New York. First of all we had a private room where the chef only served us. He explained every dish thoroughly and answered any questions we had.We started with a flan of salmon row from Hokkaido served in warm soup. The roe was perfect and the flan was great. Next was the sea urchin with fresh botan ebi from Canada topped with oestra caviar. The dish was fishy, salty and tasted perfect. The shrimp tasted like they were cooked, even though they were raw, and the sweetness of the shrimp balanced the brininess of the sea urchin and caviar.Next was the New Zealand John Dory with eggplant and sumi yaki sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked as was the eggplant, and the ginger taste came through in the dish. The French foie gras with South African mango was seared and spectacular. The mango added a perfect amount of sweetness to the richness of the foie gras and this was one of best foie gras that I have ever had.The seared Tasmanian abalone with pasta and tomato sauce was cooked perfectly and was a little peppery. The tomatoes and pasta added a nice contrast to the abalone. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and arugula added bitterness to the dish. The last seafood dish was Canadian lobster that was cooked with olive oil, garlic, shallots and topped with fresh tarragon. The lobster was fresh and sweet and the broth from the olive oil, garlic, and shallots was amazing. Our next savory course was Wagyu beef with fresh grated wasabi, garlic chips and spring onion. This was the best wagyu beef I've ever tasted. The meat was cut into cubes and cooked perfectly medium rare. The fresh wasabi was mild and perfect for the meat, which melted in my mouth. The final savory course was chicken stock with Japanese snapper and rice porridge. The fish was tender, the broth was great and the rice added a nice vehicle for both the broth and the fish.We moved to another room for dessert, which was granita of Kyoto grape. The granita was very sweet and the grape was great. This was a refreshing dessert. As we ate dessert, we looked over the harbor and across Singapore. The view was amazing as was the food."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sublime,1,50,18-Feb-12,The best dining experience in Singapore. Exquisite ingredients and presentation and fabulous to watch the chef cooking in front of you. Tetsuya was there as well so the experience was complete.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Utterly Brilliant,1,50,20-Jan-12,"Dinner at Tetsuya Wakuda's venture ""Waku Ghin"" in Singapore. There are two seatings per night and the first must have been running late as there was a 10-15 minute wait at the bar.The restaurant is divided into a series of rooms each with seats at a counter and large teppan. The majority of the dishes are cooked on the teppan in front of you by a single chef through the evening. Desserts are served in a single larger room with regular tables and a view of the bay.The dish highlights were the Crushed potato with smoked eel, Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin and Oscietre Caviar, Steamed Alaskan King Crab with Yuzu scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon.Service was excellent - friendly and well informed.I would recommend it as the food is utterly brilliant, easily among my favourites from the trip, I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Was this the best meal I have ever eaten?,1,50,27-Nov-11,"If it wasn't it was certainly in the top 5. OK it was eye wateringly expensive for Singapore ($400 Sing for food alone) but the ingredients were the best quality in the world, they were beautifully cooked and presented and in a lovely intimate environment. Frankly I would rather have one fabulous meal like that than a dozen ho hum meals. Particular standouts were the signature dish of Sea Urchin with Oscietra caviar, the Alaskan King Crab cooked on the teppan on salt and the wagyu with fresh wasabi. We did have some excellent wine to accompany the food but it seemed almost redundant because of the subtle complexity of the flavours. In a word - superb!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting experience,1,50,20-Nov-11,"There's so much to say - where do I even start? The whole dinner was a very interesting (and positive) experience indeed.We booked a degustation (priced at S$500 per pax) for two. The hosts were impeccably polite and polished. We were led to a teppanyaki-styled dining area which seats about 6 pax. The ambience was nice and cozy, with nice marble table-tops.As it was a degustation menu, it was pretty much ""fixed"". However, the chefs were attentive and checked if there was anything which we would like to them replace (i.e some diners may not want beef due to dietary retrictions). The food was exquisite, concocted from the very best and freshest ingredients sourced the world over, e.g botan ebi, abalone, sea urchins, wagyu beef, etc. The presentation was refined and reflected a fusion of Japanese and Western cuision, which underscores the style of each dish. The best dish was the finely sliced Wagyu beef served with freshly ground Wasabi, which definitely left us wanting more!Some of the dishes on the menu were prepared in front of you, where the Chef would cook it on the teppan, to your preference and liking. While the Chef did not demonstrate knife-juggling skills as you would expect in a normal teppan restaurant, he took great care in explaining each dish and how it is best eaten. This made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.The desert was served in a separate room, overlooking Marina Bay. We were treated to an unexpected firework display over the bay, as there were some ongoing celebrations. The Ghin cheesecake, which is their signature dish, was simply yummy! In addition, you could choose up to 4 different kinds of petit fours, all of which were delightfully good. Would definitely visit again, when they have a new seasonal menu."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",even better than tetsyua sydney,1,50,11-Sep-11,"Love, Love, Love this place. Would have to say it was the best dinning experience of my life! A magical evening of taste sensations, best wine list I have ever seen and can not wait to get back"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth it!,1,50,5-Sep-11,I ate here 2 weeks ago and had such a good experience! They only serve a 10-course degustation menu worth SGD 400. It is pricey but definitely worth it. See my blog entry for details of what I thought about each of the 10 courses:http://goodfoodishappiness.blogspot.com/2011/08/waku-ghin-japanese-fine-dining-and.htmlShould be worth a try for special occasions and that once in a lifetime experience!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","do not care about money, just care about.. products and quality",1,50,21-Jun-11,"I am going there every months or almost... been to many restaurants in Singapore and abroad ( I am an expat..) but Waku Ghin is ""very special"". The best products, individual rooms, friendly staff, so what more you could expect ? and for the one who complain about the bill... my answer, don't go ! by the way, if you go to good restaurants in Europe, it will cost you much more !"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Beyond Expectation,1,50,9-Jun-11,"Excellent concept, totally diferrent to Tetsuya. The chef cook infront of you and interact with the diners. Too bad we didnt get Mr Tetsuya to cook for us =(
10 courses, matching wines is available for $150. Bit pricey compare to Tetsuya
Staff are friendly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A seriously misunderstood restaurant,1,50,18-May-11,"I'm not sure what planet the previous reviewers are from, but this is a ""do not miss"" visit when in Singapore. Sure it is expensive, but if you are interested in trying the best of the best you must visit. Tetsuya Wakuda's commitment to only using the best and freshest ingredients possible (even if it means sourcing them from far away) results in an unforgettable taste experience. The light and sensitive touch in the kitchen, with a focus on not messing with quality ingredients is no doubt due to his grounding in japanese cuisine. The sea urchin with barely-cooked lobster topped by caviar is an ethereal experience that I recommend to all. The only down side is a heavily marked-up wine list with no half bottle options, but the sommelier kindly provided 3 glass pours for the price of a half bottle. The service is immaculate and friendly. If this does not get 3 Michelin stars soon, a Senate enquiry will be warranted!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE- AMAZING!!,1,50,7-Apr-11,"I cannot believe that this restaurant has gotten so many poor reviews...i thought it was absolutely fantastic. We came to singapore for only one night after a 2 week trip in cambodia, vietnam and laos. I saw this restaurant as listed as one of the top restaurants and since my family and I are very into fine dining we decided to give this place a try and we were NOT disappointed.Yes, it is VERY expensive so i do not suggest going there if you will be upset about spending all of that money on food- do not go if have budget restraints! However, if you get past that, the dining experience is incredible. We walked into the restaurant and were seated by the charming australian sommelier . He really made our experience. He chose amazing wines for us in our wine pairing. As the other reviews said, you sit in rooms for 5 to 6 people and since my family is 5 we had one all to ourselves. The service was quite attentive and the time between meals was great. Now, for the food...i do not have my menu with us so i don't know every exact name of the dishes but here it goes: our first dish was some exotic fish that reminded me of a tuna belly or hamashi but it was fantastic...very fresh. The thing about the food here is that it is not like allinea in chicago (LOVED) or fat duck (which i didnt like)...the chefs not into molecular gastronomy. The food is just the best ingredients (Thats why they charge so much) done simply and SO well...therefore, some people can misconstrue this simplicity as a waste of money...it's very difficult to do food the way they did even though it seems very simple. The only dish i was not crazy about was the sea urchin which is their speciality. I had sea urchin at Charlie Trotters in Chicago and i liked it better there. However, the kobe was phenomenol and i don't even like crab and i loved it there. The ingredients are so fresh that the menu changes daily (even though i don't completely buy that...it's mainly the same but a few things change like the deserts). One of my favorite dishes of the night was the egg with truffles and potato...SO delicious. The portions are nice sized but theres only about 6 real dishes (i don't count the soup) and then you're moved to the other room for desert. The room has a nice view and it's a great atmosphere change. We had melons and a cheese cake and the deserts were fantastic...a lot of times these 3 Michelin type restaurants mess up the deserts but their signature cheese cake was great. They ended you off with petit fours but thats it...that's always a disappointment when they don't do anything more at the end of such a nice meal...we always look forward to what we called ""the punches""-- the extra deserts at the end that are not on the menu but here's a heads up if you're into that. We ended up with a nice desert wine and some zambuca and a large check...but from the food to the sommelier and the experience, it's worth the money if you can afford it and appreciate cooking at its best."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The El Bulli + Fat Duck of the East... A foodie experience not to be missed when in Singapore,1,50,17-Dec-10,"This is my 4th visit and everytime I have come here, the experience has been a tour-de-force for the palette, never once disappointing - standards still kept high. If you've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney's, this place ratches the ""wow"" at least 5 notches. Be forewarned that reservatiions here are difficult to come by - with at least a week or two prior recommended. The experience however doesn't start off too well as the lobby area before you get to the food looks strangely like a souless airport lounge with an empty bar area. Ushered quickly to one of the 3 or 4 private rooms, the show begins as you sit down in front of a large teppan grill and the chefs present the fresh food of the day. This is really the soul of Waku Ghin - the fresh ingredients. Unlike fat duck or el bulli - there is no magic molecular gastronomy - it is just simply the best of the freshest ingredients from Australia or Japan that money can buy - combined in the most delightfully simple of ways - executed to a science, but performed as an art in front of you... the loving way the chefs prepare each dish in front of your eyes is a visual treat in itself - not to be missed. A cautionary note here that with the freshest and best ingredients - comes a very hefty price tag with a wine paired 6 course dinner setting you back about $700 per person. Without the wine is $400.On to the food - WG's signature dish: Uni with bontan shrimp and cavier - does not disappoint. It is always consistently amazing. My other favorite is by special request only so try to ask for this : a lightly charcoal grilled tuna belly - with charcoal from Japan giving the tuna belly a wonderful just slighly smoky aroma and taste. Served with the tinest portions of grated ginger and fresh wasabi - it is an amazing palette kicker.The other courses are good - but the first two I mentioned are truly outstanding.The abalone (somewhere towards the end) - though visually stunning whilst cooking - is not to my liking as it come out a tad too rubbery and flavors clash. I would suggest you ask to replace this if you are not a fan of abalone anyway.The Kagoshima beef (Grade 5) at the very end served 2 ways - completes the experience with just the right amount of meat. Slowcooked for the last 30 minutes - it melts in your mouth.. paired with garlic chips (fr Japan) - to die for! Lastly, the palette cleansing tea at the end - is very refreshing and tastes very much like a seaweed broth and clearly some of the finest tea leaves used.Desserts are OK - so if you are already full and choose to skip - you won't be missing out."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious and Fresh Salmon Sashimi,1,40,15-Oct-18,"Went there and had the dinner buffet. The spread of items were quite extensive from sashimi to grill to some dishes.I enjoyed the salmon sashimi, pumpkin chawamushi and garlic fried rice the most.I found the pumpkin chawamushi very interesting which felt like a fusion of Western and Japanese cuisine.Service was good but could have been better. Some of the serving staff seemed new and inexperienced.My partner and I managed to order and finish 41 plates/bowls."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and Atmosphere,1,50,14-Oct-18,Good quality of foodGood ambience for friends catching up over dinner. Food is served with reasonable portions. Serving time is not a long wait.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent service,1,40,10-Oct-18,I have been patronising this and their Katong outlet. The service level is excellent and has not failed me. Good choice of buffet. will continue to dine at their restaurants.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner ,1,40,6-Oct-18,Decided to try this much heard about ala carte buffet for my birthday dinner. Food is above average with lots of choices from the menu. From sashimi to sushi to tempura to yakitori and many others. Sashimi was fresh and portion is served accordingly to the number of people. But service was a bit slow and orders left out towards the end thus it took a long time but was rectified after the supervisor was informed. Overall it’s definitely worth a visit but perhaps not on a weekend where the restaurant is really packed. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic ala carte buffet,1,50,3-Oct-18,I came here for their 1-for-1 ala carte buffet by Chope.The sashimi was very fresh. The other dishes they served were tasty too. The served each dish we ordered in small portion so that we can eat more variety of food in the menu. I like!My husband and I kept coming back for this promotion because it is value for money and we get to eat our favorite Japanese food at a fraction of what we usually pay in other Japanese restaurant! Very good deal!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth Ala-Carte buffet,1,40,2-Oct-18,The Ala carte buffet price is worth and the quality is up to the standard. The sashimi are fresh and the grill meats have more varieties.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Slow Service,1,40,13-Sep-18,"Went there with colleagues on a weekday lunch. Plenty of parking in the building.Food was relatively good. Sashimi was excellent. Thick juicy slices. Shrimp Tempura nice too. Sushi was average. The Chopped Tuna Belly Sushi was horrible. We left them mostly untouched (and was told by staff not to waste food).Service was acceptable but very slow. We waited almost 45 minutes for some dishes. After chasing for some orders in vain, we placed other orders, thinking that the earlier orders were lost in transit. But they all arrived together at the end, forcing us to eat when we were already full. All in, we were there for close to 2 hours.We ordered the a la carte buffet at $43.90++ each. Ocha at $1.90++ not included. With Entertainer app 1 for 1 main course deal, it worked out to only $28 per person. Not a bad deal. I was told similar offers are available on Chope. Come here if you like sashimi, have an offer and 2 hours to spare. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,1,50,11-Sep-18,Sashimi is fresh and it is one of the very few places that serve swordfish sashimi in their buffet. Food is served quickly so you don't have to worry about waiting even when it's crowded. And there is a wide variety to choose from.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori UE Square,1,40,1-Sep-18,I prefer the Katong outlet where seating arrangements are more spaced out and staff are more friendly and accomodating.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great buffet,1,40,29-Aug-18,Definitely go for the buffet! If you have The Entertainer App you can get this as 1 for 1 which is very great value for money! I always eat WAY too much though!

Was apprehensive about the service based on reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. New staff Jay was especially helpful polite and friendly. You could see they try hard with English. What would have been nice was if tea was included in the price, instead of $1.90/pax"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food but no special orders entertained,1,40,19-Apr-18,"Tucked away at a really quiet mall (UE Square), lies this Japanese ala Carte buffet restaurant (it basically means that they prepare and serve whatever you order through the ipad). One annoying thing is that the app crashes from time to time and then we’d have to let in the orders again.The quality of food overall was great, and if you go during lunch and get the 1 for 1 (we went for dinner), this would be really great value for money! The staff were very conscientious in clearing the plates of food that we have finished eating.The main irritation was not we could not made any special orders - the feature on the ipad app does not work and the staff were insistent we could not modify any dish (basically we wanted the torches salmon aburi without the rice). Another surprising feature was that we were charged for drinks! Hot or cold green tea is usually included when we pay $40++ for a buffet..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet and Helpful staff!,1,40,15-Mar-18,"(This review is meant for the Katong Square outlet)We were here for the ala carte buffet lunch and as we were early, only 1-2 tables were occupied then. (but shortly, many diners came and it was about 70% full).The restaurant is new (barely started operations no more than few months ago) has a nice and lovely ambience, cosy and it played Japanese songs and music which I think it was great and perfectly nice.We were ushered to a table by the staff, who was very friendly and patient in bringing us through the menu, and how to make the order via the tablet. It was quite ""high tech"" but once you got the hand of it, it was quite easy to operate.The spread of the buffet was quite extensive (over 100+ items), ranging from the sushi to salmon, ramen, udon, tempura, katsu etc. And quality was good too, would say most of the food items met our ""expectation"" or exceeded it. They were fresh, well marinated with tasty sauce and deep fried to perfection.The portion was great and relevant, to minimize wastage and yet sufficient to ""feed"" the hungry stomach. (anyway, you can reorder again and again)Service was overall good. Besides friendly and helpful staff, the used plates were promptly cleared despite of the quite big dinning crowd with only 2 servers! And our orders were also served quite fast unlike some other restaurants that would take a long time for the food to be served.Well, the only feedback we had were as follows. The airconditioning was very powerful and cold (at least from where we sat) and we felt ""freezing"" but luckily thanks to the hot ramen that saved us from the day!To our surprise, there was no dessert or cut fruits in the buffet spread. Usually most other ala carte Japanese buffet would have some ice creams, mochi, jelly and fresh cut fruits within the same price range, to be fair in comparison.Next, there was also no drinking water inclusive in the buffet! This was strange as most of the Japanese restaurants we had visited included that (not to mention some even included green tea, soft drinks or even coffee). A glass of iced water was chargeable at $0.80!!! Though refillable, we felt it was not worth it and so we skipped it (of course not ordering the other beverages as the price was not value for money).For pricing aspect, it was quite great value for money as there's an on-going 1-for-1 promotions for the buffet, so we ended up paying around $50+ for 2 persons, which was wonderful since we were able to try so many different Japanese food.We enjoyed the food here, having tried over 40+ items and if they would include drinking water and some desserts/fruits, it would receive a 5-star rating!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,1,40,25-Feb-18,"Brought my family to their restaurant since my son didn’t have sashimi for a long while. It was almost closing when we got there, servers were too busy to attend us, and we have to wait a while though we have reservation before reaching. We were very hungry so placed orders for some sashimi and drinks first. Generous servings of food served, overall food quality is good. "

And you get much more - an extensive menu that includes yakitori, sushi, agemono and much much more. A must try. I’ll surely be visiting again. My only gripe - the service could have been more attentive. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,1,40,14-Dec-17,We enjoyed the food as the portion is decent and the quality is better than we expected for buffet. The only thing that can be better is cleanliness of the place as our seats initially were dirty which the waiter offered to clean up for us and the floor had paper napkins too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly staff & nice food,1,40,11-Dec-17,Staff are friendly . Food is nice . Unable to try all as too many variety to choose. Will definitely go again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Japanese food,1,50,11-Dec-17,"I have been to Shin Minori several times in the past. Always a great experience. Last week I had a visiting colleague from Japan (native Japanese). I decided to take him to Shin Minori. High risk, right ? Never take someone from a foreign country, familiar with how their food should be, to a restaurant of their heritage, for them to compare against, right ?I had confidence in Shin Minori, as my prior experiences were all great.My friend gave Shim Minori 2 thumbs up! (I wasn't all that surprised!).The sushi, Temaki (hand rolls) were great (but how can you mess up raw fish,right?). The cooked meals were also great (and that was where the real challenge was). Tori Wasabi Mayo (Grilled chicken with wasabi mayo), Kani Tenpura (soft shell crab), Yaki Onigiri (Grilled minced chicken balls), so many other items to choose from, all great.Great service. Great ambiance."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good Service, food is fresh",1,40,5-Dec-17,"Good service, the birthday voucher is really worth it the money. Food is fresh will come again next time."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent salmon sashimi slices!,1,50,2-Dec-17,Came here with a few friends for dinner last week and was amazed at the more than 130+ items on the menu. The sashimi slices were thick and we had a huge spread of food on our table. Reasonably priced too!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",LOVE IT,1,50,2-Dec-17,"this is my go to restaurant for jap buffet, esp with its 1 for 1 deal. cheap but quality food and a wide variety of choices !"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Just a gathering of old friends ,1,40,30-Nov-17,"We are a group of 4 old school pals meeting up for dinner. This place was offered quite a good spread for an ala carte buffet! You get sashimi and sushi, tempura and some meat dish too. They also have noodles like soba and udon. Overall it’s a very good deal if you like JAPANESE food. Don’t expect fine dining but I’ll say that they are above average. I’d definitely return another day!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So far food not bad n fast service too.,1,40,30-Nov-17,More variety will be good as no soft shell crab. If can provide drinks will be much more better as price not cheap for lunch buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,1,40,29-Nov-17,"The selection was quite wide and sashimi was fresh. Especially loved the salmon and swordfish sashimi. The maki rolls were great as well, it was rare to see innovative maki rolls (like rainbow roll, dragon) offered in a buffet instead of the usual California roll. Of course the taste still cannot beat an ala carte order of dragon roll at other japanese restaurant but I am satisfied as it was to have it on the buffet menu. The waiting time can take sometime during busy hours. Best to go early and order quickly."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome experience,1,50,28-Nov-17,"Awesome experience. Food is good and fresh. Service is ok, free birthday cake, and ambiance is great for family gathering too."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great Food, Not-so-Fantastic Service",1,40,23-Nov-17,"Headed over to Shin Minori (UE Square outlet) for the lunch buffet on last Sunday afternoon, because of the pleasant experience sometime in June.Took a little while before we were shown to our seats, but completely understandable due to the staff busy serving the many tables. However, when indicating to the supervisor/manager about a promotion code that we would like to utilise for the lunch buffet, he seemed rather disgruntled, where instructions for us to redeem the code sounded rather blunt. We felt the tone was rather uncalled for, as discount or not, we are still paying patrons. Nonetheless, we brushed it off rather quickly, and waited for our orders to arrive.Food arrived and they were as great as the previous time we had visited. The raw fish tasted fresh, and the Dragonfly Sushi was one of our favorites such that we had ordered twice. The meat dishes were nothing to shout about, but were still good. We were a little disappointed, though that a version of the cheese croquet (previously available) was not there anymore. The staff attending to us did not quite understand what we were conveying too well, probably because she was new to the job.So 2.50pm came and the same manager/supervisor came round our table, shoving the bill to us, and the tone used in informing us of the closing time felt rather pushy. While we understand the place closes at 3pm, we felt that a different tone used would have made the experience more pleasant, instead of making customers feel like they are being chased out.All in all, for the food we will definitely head back again, with hope that the next dining experience will be somewhat better."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty fresh sashimi,1,40,22-Nov-17,Sashimi is fresh and waitresses are friendly. I like the sashimi. Lacks dessert though and would have been great if 5hey offer ice cream.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,1,40,20-Nov-17,"Even though the waiting time for the food is a bit long, but I think is okay since the food is nice. (You order through the tablet)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Japanese Buffet!,1,50,19-Nov-17,"Arguably one of the best Japanese buffets I've ever had so far. If you're really particular about your sashimi, then Shin Minori probably wouldn't disappoint as their thickly-sliced sashimi is really fresh and delicious. I'd certainly go back there again for my next sashimi indulgence."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher,1,50,19-Nov-17,"Great deal when there is a birthday voucher. Reservation went smoothly, food selection is great while sashimi is a steal."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese buffet!,1,50,18-Nov-17,"I've been here before and loved it, so I brought my mum this time so she could try it too. Very reasonable pricing for such great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the portions generous. This is a good choice because everyone gets to order what they want (not hampered by different preferences)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,1,50,17-Nov-17,Good selection of Japanese food at this ala carte buffet. The yakitori especially was really good. The sashimi was really fresh. Would have been even better if other drinks and dessert were included.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",good food,1,40,15-Nov-17,"salmon was fresh but swordfish slightly off that day. nevertheless, the rest of the food was decent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,1,40,13-Nov-17,Buffet is pretty good. Ordering is done through a tablet. However a cup of ice water or green tea costs money!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,1,40,12-Nov-17,Buffet spread was quite big but I wished desserts were included. Sashimi was good and I love their stir-fried beef dish!!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",nice food,1,40,12-Nov-17,food was nice. serving was fast. just the place is too cramp. table to table too close. can't talk freely. no privacy. just eat.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin minori,1,50,12-Nov-17,"Really love the quality of food here! It’s also quite affordable, lunch buffet was $40++/per and if it’s your birthday month you can also get to dine for free with mins 2 adults"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An awesome Japanese buffet,1,40,6-Nov-17,Minori has always been my favourite Jap buffet restaurant due to its affordability and wide range of selection. Ambience is great too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only worth it if you got birthday voucher,1,40,6-Nov-17,Abit pricy at $40++ for weekday lunch buffet. Sashimi and sushi are nice. Only worth it if one of you has the birthday voucher.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fantastic food,1,50,2-Nov-17,very good selection. love how they had pumpkin in their chawanmushi. got to try their japanese fried rice and mentaiko spaggheti! Not salty yet fragrant! sashimi is melt-in-mouth even for tuna which normally doesn't taste well in most japanese restaurants! Price is very reasonable and service is quick!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food and value for money,1,40,30-Oct-17,"This is my second visit to the restaurant. After my first visit , the experience was good and decided to bring my family down for a meal since it was my daughter birthday as well. The food was well portion as instruction was clear on the ipad on how many piece was served. The sashimi was fresh and we all enjoyed our self. Will definitely be back in the future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food is good but expensive for kids,1,50,30-Oct-17,"The food is good but the pricing is quite high for children, only $10 cheaper compared to adult price. Certain dish was served very late. I liked the chawamushi with pumpkin sauce. Empty dishes were cleared very fast which is a plus point especially when the tables are not spacious."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friday night,1,40,29-Oct-17,"Food came pretty fast but somehow because it was a Friday night, a lot of our orders came in repeat ! Maybe can opt going on mon-thurs when there's less people to avoid such. Food was okay not bad for a Japanese buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worthiness of the buffet lunch,1,40,28-Oct-17,My favourite dish is fried baby cuttlefish and chicken wing. Raw salmon is fresh and juice. May be can try to ask for tables with portable ipad for making order instead of the one that stick onto the partition.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",jap buffet,1,40,27-Oct-17,quite a variety of food. sashimi is fresh and tasty. other cooked foods are so-so. desserts and beverages not included in the buffet and chargeable. service is so-so.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",first visit,1,40,23-Oct-17,good overall experience. prompt confirmation of reservation but was not aware of 2 shifts until i call up.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,1,50,23-Oct-17,"Sashimi swordfish, octopus, tempura and pumpkin chawanmushi were good. Lesser variety for teppanyaki. Should have included free flow green tea in the buffet menu instead of charging it separately in the bill. Used the birthday voucher on that day."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",First time try,1,40,23-Oct-17,"I like the foods but Hard to call for service and serving food service abit slow
Hope next attempt I can see the improvement from you all
Thanks"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Birthday Treat,1,40,15-Oct-17,Food was yummy and service was good. Food came piping hot and fresh. I gave it a 4/5 because there is no desert on the menu. Otherwise would have been a perfect 5.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very good,1,40,9-Oct-17,"Food is good but would be better if there are more varieties for the buffet. Only salmon sashimi and steamed egg chawanmushi were served fast, the rest took quite a Long time. Longest was like half an hour for the chicken wing. Suggest to order more things at one go so that You don't have to wait so Long. Saw a mini spider on the table btw."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Ala-Carte Buffet Spread,1,40,9-Oct-17,"We went on a Friday lunch for the ala-carte buffet - it was quite crowded and the dishes took awhile to come. They tend to miss out certain dishes if you order a variety of dishes at once, so try to order in small quantities. Also, note that the drinks and dessert are not included in the buffet. Regardless, the staff were friendly; the best thing was the sashimi, which was really fresh and good value for money. Their sushi options are interesting and taste good too."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Decent food, poor service",1,40,9-Oct-17,"Shin Minori provides you with the typical buffet experience- you can get quite a bit of average food for your money, but the service is sub-par. Many of the servers didn't speak English and weren't able to understand our requests. The food came out relatively quickly except for the grill items, and when we were missing a lot of items we ordered, the wait staff told us that all the orders had been fulfilled. We therefore re-ordered the missing items and they showed up twice (beware of this happening as there is a food wastage charge of $10/100g). The food is decent, though you shouldn't be expecting the most high quality sushi from a buffet restaurant. The gyoza was quite good, as well as the fried soft-shell crabs. It was an easy place to go with a large group and share lots of items. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Always satisfying,1,50,7-Oct-17,"Came many times , this time was the birthday voucher so we came back. Sashimi quality is good.
The rest are all good too. Worth the visit if you haven't been here. Try go during promotions."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value and excellent quality ,1,50,17-Sep-17,"Cosy restaurant parked in a not so crowded UE shopping mall.... good thing.Restaurant usually packed so reservations recommended. Have private rooms and floor seating sections too. Would be better if there were more space to cater for many more patrons.The buffet alacarte menu is commendable. The spread is wide and quality of the food served is excellent. Sections of sashimi, sushi, tempura, maki, rolls, barbecue, salad, noodles, rice, and much more.Good and fast service and orders are placed thru electronic apps (tablets). Sushi and barbecue orders takes a bit longer though as it's made fresh.The buffet price excludes dessert and drinks, though.... and kids below 5 yrs old eat for free & child rates up to 10 yrs old.Highly recommended and happy eating."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb selection and quality of food!,1,40,14-Sep-17,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Shin Minori. Some colleagues and I visited for their lunch buffet and to our amazement, the claim of having more than 160 dishes is fo'real! There was a wide selection of dishes from rice and noodles to soup, sushi, sashimi, appetizers, maki, yakitori and teppanyaki - all this for $45 (including service charge and government tax). Service was good and the waiters were very responsive. The ambience is quiet and peaceful and I like that they do not enforce a time limit for the buffet. A little tip: if you go on their website, you'll find vouchers for special add-on items (for free). We were gifted a free snow crab nabe that was deeelicious! I have recommended this place to friends and family and will definitely be doing a second round there. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent experience,1,50,14-Sep-17,"As usual, the salmon sashimi is a draw for me. Very good! Won't be my last time. Will look forward to going again with my family."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Slightly pricey, but good quality",1,40,11-Sep-17,"Had birthday voucher for one free buffet lunch, but still found it on pricier side. Food was mostly fresh because prepared on the spot. Sashimi a bit fishy, and beef dish was dry and overcooked. Fried items were really great though! Food portions were very thoughtfully adjusted for tasting amounts, but became way too much later on. Overall, good variety and quality!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable Japanese Food,1,40,9-Sep-17,One of my favorite places to go to (with a good view) for affordable Japanese food at HarbourFront area.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good,1,40,8-Sep-17,"The disappointing thing is we requested for a corner table, but it wasn't given even when the restaurant was 80% empty. Otherwise, cooked food were mostly served warm so it was delicious."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch at Shin Minori,1,40,5-Sep-17,"The Japanese Buffet spread is good and it is value for money. The service is good and the ambience is also conducive. Just feel that perhaps, Shin Minori can provide free flow of soft drinks."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic and excellent place!,1,50,22-Aug-17,"Came on a busy Sunday afternoon for the lunchtime buffet using the Entertainer app (1-for-1 promotion). We ordered the sashimi platter several times and it was amazing. Highly recommend the sashimi (Tuna and Salmon) as it is very fresh. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. However, with that being said, I think the place can also improve further. For example, my partner and I were seated at a table which was very squeezy. We were placed next to the utensils drawers. It ruined the ambience for me, as I was constantly listening to the staff pulling and closing the drawers (it was very loud as well). The restaurant uses the ""tablet menu"", and for my partner and I, the table was already small enough (2 platters and the table would be too full for even a cup of water), there was no space (no drawer, compartment below table) for the tablet so we had to lean it against the wall standing up. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value!,1,40,22-Aug-17,Came for birthday one for one lunch buffet. Sashimi is fresh! Would visit again when there are promotions - next year

Hope to see some little desserts included in the ala carte buffet to end off the meal. Dropped a star as i felt the tables were placed so close to each other that we were able to hear each other's conversations.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hmm,1,40,14-Aug-17,Good food but price has creep up a little since last visit. The buffet will be more appealing if free flow tea is included. Sashimi is fresh.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One of the best,1,40,28-Jun-17,"If there's any place I religiously frequent for fresh sashimi it's Shin Minori. I have been visiting this eatery for over 2 years, and it's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants that stick to their standards. Never once had I eaten a badly prepared dish. I have taken a counter seat before and seen the chefs work their crafts. Very dedicated individuals. But like every other no one place is perfect. I think their customer service (from the waiters / waitresses) leaves much to be desired, often not getting the correct orders, and rather clumsy. Their ordering system (the use of mobile devices) is not very fluid either, having experienced network failure and app crashes occasionally. That being said, still quite worth the buck if you are on the Mission to find good sashimi. Rest of the food is good too. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,1,40,27-Jun-17,"The food was excellent. With the self ordering system, it was much easier to manage the ordering and the food was served fast. The dessert and drink were not included in the buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Value!,1,40,27-Jun-17,"Good variety and the sashimi was wonderfully fresh and succulent! Great value for money! Only letdown was the online ordering system as it did not capture our initial order though a message prompting 'order sent' was seen. We were left waiting for quite a while and upon checking with one of the staff, was told that they did not receive the order and we had to key in our orders again. Also, our request for refill of our plain water was left attended and we had to request again. In the end, one staff just came and left a tumbler of water on our table."

Lots of items on the menu to choose from, although unlikely to sample them all. Casual and comfortable atmosphere too.I liked the quail egg alot and their chicken was done well.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday treat 2017,1,40,26-May-17,"As a show of appreciation for customers patronage, they're treating birthday celebrants to ala carte buffet lunch within their birthday month accompanied by at least one paying companion. And what a treat it was! You choose & tap your desired dishes from a tablet and with just a short wait after sending your order, food is served. Want more? Then tap tap tap again. As long as you don't waste food. Service was quick. The food quality was very good with really fresh sashimi & other ingredients. Beautifully plated. One improvement needed though is to train the staff to be more hospitable. It's fine even if they do not smile for as long as they do not sulk as well hehe. Anyway, why are they looking sullen? Maybe they need some positive incentives. Just saying. "

Visited most of the popular jap buffets in singapore and I always find myself coming back to Shin Minori. I love the really great variety of food Shin Minori has to offer and also the freshness of their sashimi and really quick service! They have never missed out a single item on our order as everything was really systematic. In most other japanese buffet restaurants, you have to manually order with the waiter while at SM, you simply order through the ipad reserved for each table. My most recent visit was in May 2017 and I must say I am pleasantly surprised the quality and standard of their food has remained the same (or even better now) compared to my last visit in 2016. I had to ask for several things during the meal such as an extra pair of chopstick and wasabi and despite it being a busy friday dinner time, the staff got me my stuff under less than 5 minutes. Their service here is simply the best!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Quick Service, Good Food",1,40,23-May-17,"My 4th time dining at Shin Minori. Had a birthday voucher to redeem which was equivalent to a 1-for-1 deal - very value for money. Buffet menu was extensive with a lot of variety to choose from. Was impressed with the improved service as compared to what I had experienced in my previous visits. Seemed to have more service staff now too. They were attentive and had good initiative. Prompt to serve up dishes, clear empty plates from our table and refill our glasses. Food was fresh. Overall standard was good. Only gripe was that quite a number of dishes (esp. the fried and grilled ones) were under-seasoned and therefore tasted quite bland which was fine as it just meant we were consuming less sodium - healthier! Will definitely be back whenever the sashimi craving kicks in."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food!,1,50,22-May-17,Food was great. It is my 2nd time there for their buffet. Love their sashimi platter! Would definitely go there again in future.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cozy,1,40,17-May-17,"Other than the onigiri, everything else is nice. Would recommend others to come and try at least once for their buffet.

Perfect place for japanese buffet once in a while."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet lunch at shin minori,1,50,8-May-17,Decide to have sashimi few days before the actual day. Used the Chope app and easily booked a reservation using the app. We were served promptly at the restaurant. Wait time for food was decent despite the restaurant was packed. The only problem we faced was the tablet that was used to order food keep hanging. Have to restart the app many times. The food list we ordered went missing a few time and we have to choose again. Hope they can solve the app issues. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi quality,1,40,8-May-17,"The sashimi was fresh and tasted really good. Many selections of food which was great.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice good and service,1,40,8-May-17,It was crowded for a weekday lunch. I like that the food comes piping hot and the sashimi was fresh.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great but needs to improve,1,40,3-May-17,"It's perfect for every occasion from birthday celebrations, farewells to festivities, or no special day actually but you just need a good food at a great price! Lovely place for yakitori & sashimi especially. Needs to work on their ordering&serving though. Ive patronised them at least once every two months and their ordering system either hangs or the order was submitted but kitchen didnt receive it. Also, once the order is sent, it doesnt get recorded on the list, so no way to track your orders. Just 2 days ago, we ended up waiting 20mins for an order which we eventually got them to check with the kitchen but they insisted there werent any orders left for the table - and we had no way to prove. I'll bring a pen and paper next time to track my orders, but I'll return for sure. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety in buffet selection,1,40,25-Apr-17,I was pleased with the selection n quality but the service of one of the staff was bad on both times i went. He was in all black so i presume he would be a supervisor but his attitude when he served was terrible.. clanging the plates on our table and rushing to clear our plates when we still had food!!

Reservations were a breeze with the Chope app. The place was easy to find and we were settled pretty quickly to our seats. Ordering was via a tablet. The quality of food was very good and fresh. However, one of our last orders never made it to our table but that was fine since we were too stuffed by then..."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really good Japanese buffet,1,50,14-Apr-17,"Tucked away inside UE Mall, you could miss this place if you didn't know about it. You have to reserve a table as the place gets really busy. For around S$47 you get a buffet choice of over 100 items! This is incredible value and you can order as much as you can. Desserts are charged separately. The food items are made to order, so you don't pick from a stale buffet table. You order on their tablet and very swiftly the food will start to arrive. We're not fans of cold tofu, so that item was a miss for us. But everything else was really good. I was actually really surprised at the price because this is a quality restaurant in a nice location, service is impeccable and the food delicious. A must try for any fans of Japanese food. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-money Japanese buffet,1,40,10-Apr-17,"We had buffet at Shin Minori on April 8, to take advantage of the OCBC three-for-one promotion. It was very good, as usual, though we enjoyed our visit three weeks earlier more. That could be because we had not had sushi/sashimi for a long time. The sashimi was very fresh and we enjoyed the moriwase before we restricted ourselves to salmon and octopus. The salmon was well marbled, but we did not manage to get a morsel of the salmon belly on our second visit (maybe that was why we enjoyed our first visit more!!). Looking forward to our next visit, but after a time lapse, of course. Meanwhile, we cannot wait to eat Gayatri's (Race Course Road) yummy fish-head curry!!! I usually tarpow."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",2nd Visit And Still Great,1,40,2-Apr-17,"My 2nd time here.This place is quite hard to get to from train station. But I prefer to walk from Clarke Quay MRT station which will probably take about 15 mins walk. For tourist best is just to take a taxi, grab car or Uber. Location is at UE Square. Food generally are good. But do expect some waiting time during weekends as usually it will be packed with diners. Best to make reservations to avoid disappointment. Service staffs are friendly. So far so good. Price for buffet is at about SGD 50. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reservation Received with Accuracy,1,50,2-Apr-17,Reservation was confirmed with several automated calls. This should be complemented with email confirmation as the calls were sometimes made at times that I was unavailable

This year though was the extra perk of enjoying a free birthday lunch buffet in honour of Shin Minori's 10th year anniversary! Definitely worth it(: and the lunch time service was really good! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",There is some areas of improvement,1,40,29-Mar-17,"Overall the dining experience as a whole was amazing but it was just the ordering of the food as well as the duration to wait for the food to arrive was pretty slow. An example was like I ordered 3 glass of ice water and it took a good 10 minutes to be send to my table. Other than that, food quality was excellent!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable Japanese buffet,1,40,29-Mar-17,"for about sgd40 per pax, the selection of food is considered extensive. The quality of the sashimi is decent, especially the swordfish, and the skewers are pretty good too."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet worth the $ if you eat sashimi ,1,40,25-Mar-17,"I like the a la carte buffet style which requires making our order through the tablet -- it cuts down waiting time and you can decide how big a portion you want, hence reduces food wastage.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food quality with average service,1,40,23-Mar-17,"The food quality was good but the staff was not very responsive, which could be due to the peak period at that time.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh, fast service (mostly)",1,40,19-Mar-17,"We were looking for a buffet place that features Japanese dishes, and decided to try this place after reading other positive reviews.The place was apparently quite popular, as it got crowded quickly.They offer either a la carte or buffet here. You basically order your food using electronic tablets available at each table. The menu on the tablet shows not just names of the dishes but also pictures, serving size (which allows you to know how much of each dish you are actually getting), and explains what each dish was. Basically, you select the dish that you want, indicate the portions, add it to the order, and click send. The process was quite simple and smooth.In general, orders arrive soon after we submitted them; mostly within about 2-3 minutes. Some dishes though, might take longer. For reasons we could not figure out, our orders of gyoza took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Sometimes they do miss an order, and you have to check with them. We had dishes that didn't show up until we asked them about it. So diners will have to keep tab on what's been served and what's yet to be served.We found the sashimi and sushi to be fresh, and the food were tasty.One disappointing issue was that drinks were not included in the buffet; not even green tea or water. You have to pay for those.We found the service to be acceptable, generally prompt. Staff were also friendly.At about S$40 per person, we felt that the buffet price was reasonable, especially if you enjoy sashimi and order lots of those.Overall this was a place worth visiting."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,1,40,18-Mar-17,"Good Japanese buffet with a huge variety of food available. However, it's s little pricey without promotion."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,1,50,17-Mar-17,There is a variety of fresh food! The salmon slices although thick was really good! It was an eat-all-you-can buffet and hence I felt it was very value for money!

Typical Japanese restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Feedback,1,40,13-Mar-17,Food variety is great. Service of staff are average. Chope printed out Groupon was show to staff before dinning but when bill arrived no discount was shown on the bill. Got to direct staff to double check the printed Groupon was with them. Time waste on billing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dining experience,1,40,13-Mar-17,"Food quality is great, the shashimi is very fresh. However service at the counter can be further improved."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bday gathering,1,40,12-Mar-17,We were placed to seat at near cashier whereas the staff and customers keep hitting against our chair.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Takoyaki A Major Score ,1,50,12-Mar-17,The kids felt like having Japanese so we decided to call at Shin Minori to allow them to select what they liked. Buffet was around $37 per pax and the selection variety was good. Sashimi was fresh so we had two servings. The rest of the dinner was featured with a surprise find of Takoyaki. The kids loved this street food in our recent trip to Japan. It was a key highlight of the evening! 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,1,50,12-Mar-17,"The quality, portion size and everything was perfect for the both of us as we love to try everything in small portions and order the stuff we like again.. Very value for money even if we were not using the bday voucher that was sent.. Shin Minori is very customer oriented, but heads up during peak times service may be a bit slower if you are rushing for time as they have many orders to process, however the waiting times were perfect for my S.O. and I to hold conversation and short break in between courses haha "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was not bad,1,40,10-Mar-17,Quite a quiet place and food variety and taste was not bad. Had Donavan who is a magician to entertain us during dinner which was quite amazing to see him perform his magic

But some food never came. Notice other diner also had this problem. When we ask a few time about the order some, some dishes told were sold out. And after few rounds of checking the dishes came out. Other dishes were serve promptly. The Kani crab and toufu dishes were the ones that told 1.5 hr and was not serve despite many round of asking and checking with the staff. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Need improvement,1,50,3-Mar-17,The service need to be improved as well as the order being processed.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value but service could be better,1,40,24-Feb-17,"The food is great but the staff are not very friendly or helpful if you are not local. Very busy so be prepared to wait for your order and book in advance, unlikely you will get in as a walk-in. Good location close to Boat Quay. Food is amazing and freshly prepared - hence the waiting times. Great value compared with Australian prices for sushi. All you can eat! Alcohol expensive. Tip - order a selection of hot and cold at same time as cold will come out faster!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality sashimi,1,40,24-Feb-17,Customers of the japanese buffet menu are spoiled for choices. The food are freshly prepared and sashimi are very fresh. Will definitely come back again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food, not enough service staff",1,40,24-Feb-17,"Not the first time I've been to shin minori; this is our family's go-to restaurant for Jap ala-carte buffet. A group of 4 of us went for the lunch buffet, it was pretty crowded though it was a weekday. Glad to have made the reservation on chope or we may not have been able to get a seat. Food was good, as usual, always love the sashimi which is extremely high quality, thick, fresh pieces. However, the service that day was particularly slow, though I attribute it to only 4 floor staff and thus I feel it isn't really their fault. Perhaps the management may want to look to hiring more staff for service or it is very tiring for them as well to serve continuously for hours. Other than that, shin minori doesn't disappoint and they are definitely a restaurant we will continue to visit :) "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Buffet Lunch,1,40,24-Feb-17,"Food portion such as chawanmushi & soup were reduce as compared to my previous visit some time back, the rest of items are still good.Service wise, probably due to lunch time so service wasn't so prompt, takes awhile for them to respond to our requests.Oerall, still a good dining experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebration,1,40,22-Feb-17,"Second time there with friends to celebrate birthday, is a good trial for friends. If it could include some desert that will complete the meal."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Gathering,1,50,20-Feb-17,Good and value for money! Sashimi was fresh and the food was good as well. There's a lot of people so service may be slow. But customers will have to understand.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese I have had outside of Australia,1,50,20-Feb-17,"Found this place on the net, they have an all you can eat buffet so went on a Saturday night only to find it was booked out, our mistake so we booked for the next night. looking forward to it all day as last day in Singapore and certainly not disappointed, seated you have an ipad with menu on it and start selecting dishes and they arrive very timely some slower than others as they are made to order, from the first plate that turned up WOW, I've had plenty of Japanese here at home but this was just different and so much better in a way I cant describe as I'mnot a food critic, only had to stop as had to catch taxi to airport, if I had to find a fault the woman on reception was rather brash but didn't spoil our experience, definitely on my must things to do next time in Singapore which wont be long."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Second time here!,1,40,18-Feb-17,"As the title suggests it was my second time at Shin Minori. It wasn't as crowded as the first time, but probably because it was a weekday lunch. Food was delivered promptly and I noticed the staff were friendlier this time round :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and fast service,1,40,17-Feb-17,Service was really fast but the food was not bad. The atmosphere was good and they were very friendly.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi till e last dish is too chunky,1,40,17-Feb-17,Food is good initially. Seem the chefs are lazy or not professional. The last dish is inedible as it's big chunks of raw fish which after one mouth full. You can feel like vomit cos the raw fish juice are too much. Shall cut thinner like the initial dish out. Overall ok . Jus the last dish of sashimi standard dropped n wasted the food. How can a chef cut the raw fish into so big chunks?
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good but,1,50,16-Feb-17,The staff sometime uhhh not responsive leh food is food as usual ummm clean and presentable all in all

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi galore!,1,40,15-Feb-17,"Even if you are not going for sashimi, there are also lots of other good stuff like the crab soup. But of course, people go there for sashimi which is good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food and Fast Service,1,40,14-Feb-17,Food served at Shin Minori is fresh and their service is fast. Sashimi sliced a little too thick. Almost double of what we get in other Japanese restaurants. I personally prefer it to be slightly thinner.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great 1-for 1 buffet,1,40,9-Feb-17,The buffet is value for money if it's 1-for-1 as charges for other items like drinks are over priced. The teriyaki BBQ items are a tad too sweet but salted grill are alright. The sashimi slices are thick and juicy. This is good for regular Japanese fare.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,1,40,7-Feb-17,Had a pleasant experience here celebrating my wife's birthday. Food was good except the grilled items which were burnt and overcooked. Staff were helpful and engaging but they are a little shorthanded during peak periods. Overall satisfied and will come back in future!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Superb food, average service",1,50,4-Feb-17,"Went to Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant on the 2nd Feb. Restaurant want not that busy when we entered. The reason I always patronise this restaurant is because the food and free flow and we don't have to get up from our seat. It's all ordered from a tablet which is provided on the tables. The food quality and presentation is really great. However I feel that providing wasabe for every single dish is very wasteful. Most of the times the staff had to clear my plate with the wasabe not even touched. Service staff there are average. However I feel that the managers there should take their job more seriously. Most of the time I can see them chit chatting in the back and even eating food at the back during service. When I thank them for clearing my plates they just totally ignore me. If you are looking for good food this is the place. However, don't expect any service "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good jap food,1,50,3-Feb-17,"Lovely food and good service :)
Though they were very busy

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,1,50,2-Feb-17,"most value for money japanese buffet I had in the longest time, sashimi was thick and fresh with no fishy taste and the dishes were served hot.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Superb quality,1,50,2-Feb-17,"The sashimi were fresh and they were generous with the portions. It's disgusting to see how other patrons just over ordered and waste the sashimi. It's definitely value for money for the sushi and sashimi. The fried stuff we're mediocre and the grilled ones are better. There is a little bit of inconsistency with the quality of the fried and grilled food but then again, it's a buffet and the chef is really busy handling the crazy amount of orders!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese Buffet,1,50,2-Feb-17,"Quality of the sashimi is good. Majority of the dishes are good. Overall, it's value for money as most of the items are good. They do have nice sake."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, kitchen staff are amazing!",1,40,30-Dec-16,"Think as we ate throughout the buffet, being seated at the chef's counter, we got to witness the flurry that the chefs experienced as orders furiously and continously flooded the kitchen. We were amazed at how the chefs worked under such intense speed and pressure, and honestly this is a clear indication that as diners, we need to learn to be patient and wait rather than assume that this is a buffet line and expect our food to come continuously and non-stop. The quality of the food was great, as usual, the staff were helpful (most of them) and offered great service. Had a pleasant experience dining here, not my first time and will definitely not be my last either (: "

Going again this weekend. Recommended.Tip: Make a reservation, it gets busy and the restaurant doesnt seat many...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with Entertainer app,1,40,28-Nov-16,"Sashimi was fresh and variety is quite good. I particularly enjoyed the pumpkin chawanmushi which is not found in other japanese restaurants. We used Entertainer app so we only paid the price of one for both of us which made the lunch very value for money. The only downside was the tablet for ordering the food. The tablet was not responsive at times and it resulted in us double-ordering as we sent the orders twice, thinking the first time was not captured as the system hanged. As such we had double orders on some dishes which meant we had less stomach for trying other dishes."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money Japanese Buffet,1,50,28-Nov-16,This is a great place for unlimited Japanese food at a reasonable price.The assortment of sashimi offered is pretty good.

The iPad ordering service was down but the staff were quick to issue out order sheets. However, this resulted in slowing of service, duplicate orders, and some missing orders. However, the staff who was in charge, Winnie, was always friendly, patient and helpful. She even remained calm after another patron got verbally abusive because of the slow service.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-Money Japanese Buffet,1,40,11-Aug-16,"We visited on a public holiday for buffet lunch. The restaurant was full-house. It might be best to place reservations in advance. The food was fresh and delectable. We especially enjoyed the sashimi, yakitori selection and various maki creations. It is best to place orders for most of the items you want at one go. Subsequent orders take awhile to arrive or might be left out, possibly due to shortage of manpower. Other than this little inconvenience, we were pleased with the quality and variety of food. I will certainly return again with friends/family for fuzz free Japanese fare. The bill for our lunch buffet (4 persons) added up to approximately $185 (including drinks). "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food, interesting ordering system for buffet meal service",1,40,9-Aug-16,"Good food, fresh seafood from their buffet menu.

The sashimi is really fresh though the location is a bit of a pain to get to from the MRT stations. Could be noisy at times, especially during dinner. But do keep in mind that buffet does not include drinks and had to be ordered separately for a la cart price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good ala carte buffet. Sashimi was fresh but the maki needs improvement as the ratio of rice to ingredients is too high.,1,40,20-Jul-16,Wide selections of dishes and good value for money. Staff were attentive.

Need more improvement on customer service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast and attentive service with awesome thick sashimi that I enjoy !really hoping for more credit card collaborations.,1,50,2-Jul-16,"If you are a lover of thick fresh juicy sashimi, Shin Minori is definitely your kindda place ! Was using the entertainer app on an 1 for 1 promo thus it was a great deal .unlikely to go if there is no 1 for 1 though ..If I'm paying the full price , I would rather go hokkaido sushi restaurant which is also currently priced at $38 for ala carte buffet lunch "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Jap Restaurant,1,40,6-Jun-16,"Awesome place to dine Japanese buffet. Free flow of Sashimi is fresh, ambiance is pretty good, food served is mostly fast. It is a bit pricey, and there wasn't wagyu beef."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great sushi for a great price in expense Singapore ,1,40,18-May-16,"Singapore has some amazing sushi places but they can be at amazing prices...Very expensive! This place has a nice atmosphere and good quality sushi. It won't be the best you ever had but certainly stands on its own. It is ""buffet"" style so you pay one price and order all you can eat. You order from tablets at the table. Super easy and efficient. I would recommend a reservation only because they put you near the kitchen on purpose without one...and we were the only ones in the restaurant!Good value and quality for the price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful Tonight!,1,50,13-May-16,Food was really good and the sashimi was fresh! My three kids (six to nine) had a good time helping themselves to the sashimi and the yakitori. My wife and I had a good spread of the food available and also plates and plates of sashimi! Service was good as well and its definitely one of the best dining experience we ever had! Must return again! :) 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh food!,1,40,12-May-16,"Food was fresh and arrives promptly. As it is a buffet, we are glad that they ensure the portions aren't too big so that we could taste and try more items. Ambience was fine as well - quite cozy and not too crowded on a Wed night. Service staff was helpful too. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mother's Day Dinner,1,40,8-May-16,"This is not our first visit to this resturant. Over the years they have been able to maintain the food quality. For a buffet, the food quality is good and decently priced. Sashimi is fresh and the food selection is quite varied. One of my ""must have"" is their garlic/pepper pork skewer. For groups they usually provide a Salmon fish head as complementary dish. A small nick pick, is that it is time to update their tablet ordering system. Which is a little klunky, slow and shuts down in mid order. Service is decent but not very attentive, but all in all a good family experience. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi served here,1,40,24-Apr-16,"We had lunch ala-carte buffet here. Many varieties to choose from and we love their sashimi most. Very fresh Salmon, tuna, yellow tail, red snapper, etc.. others like takoyaki, grilled saba fish, salad, yakitori, were good as well. Food served to us fast & efficient. Can order in small portions which is good and you dont waste food. Staffs were friendly and helpful. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi,1,40,19-Apr-16,"Went here the second time last night. It did not dissappoint. Sashimi as always was fresh and the portions were just like ala carte portions. Their robotayakis was impressive. Makis were just so so. Service was superb. They should check the tablets, they dont seem to work at the right moment. Over all i would recommend this place. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good service and good food,1,40,10-Apr-16,"Went there using the 1 for 1 lunch redemption coupon. We were only given an hour to order our food. Despite this, the service was still fast n prompt. Sashimi were fresh!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",not impressed,1,40,5-Apr-16,"Shin Minori Restaurant what could I say, my first encounter not impressed with this establishment and I could honestly say that I had much better Japanese food elsewhere. Ordering thru a Samsung tablet which is neither friendly nor instinctive placed the restaurant on the cheap eat scale .Staff seemed pleasant and friendly and attentive. Frankly, the food lacked variety, and the quality of food was average with a run-of-the-mill taste. Certainly not worth the price charged. Very dissatisfied, I would not rush for a second return."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality japanese buffet. Excellent service.,1,50,5-Apr-16,"Pleasant trip. Good quality food, excellent service. Staff are attentive, but would be good if they are clearer with the ordering tablet. No one brief us to submit the order, end up we waited in vain for 20 minutes as we thought our orders were already processed. Else, everything was good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Inconsistent and unpredictable, but usually good",1,40,24-Mar-16,"This restaurant's ala carte buffet has an excellent selection of dishes at a rather reasonable price tag. The only problem is the standards that vary on different days of the week and sometimes even on the same evening.Most of the time, the sashimi is sweet and fresh - there was only one occasion where I thought the fish could have been fresher. The temaki selection is wonderful but wildly inconsistent - the same dish ordered a second time might not be as good as the first. If it's good, the seaweed is crunchy. The kabocha chawanmushi (pumpkin egg custard) is usually excellent with the right consistency, but if you're unlucky you will get a watery version. The Gyuniku Shogayaki is very tasty as is the agedashi tofu. If you can afford the cholesterol, try the Uzura Shioyaki (grilled quail eggs with salt). The tori teppan and Asari Shiru are also must -trys. The tempura is nothing to shout about, unfortunately. Despite the unpredictable standard, I'd still recommend this place as the dishes hit the spot most of the time. And the price is inexpensive, considering the variety."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Japanese food,1,40,12-Mar-16,"With the promotional 1 for 1, it makes the buffet really value for money. The sashimi were good in general, most dishes were pleasant, nothing much to comment on negatively."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,1,40,9-Mar-16,"Restaurant staff was friendly and attentive. Food also arrived within minutes after placing order. However, the tablet used for placing orders was having some problems and we had to wait quite a while before we could order. Other than this overall was a good experience"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friend bday dinner for party of 10,1,50,26-Feb-16,"Was given a private room which was unexpected but good surprise n service was excellent :) staff gave a reminder call n though we clocked in 100 items of ala carte orders, food arrived timely n in good portions"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Vday Dinner 2016,1,50,15-Feb-16,"bought 3x Yu Sheng Promo from Shin Minori and their service left me a good impression and thought would take an opportunity to have a meal there.Since its Vday and my buddy is in town, I booked for a table for 4. As there were a crowd, we waited appox 5 mins for a table which is pretty expected. Welcome with a smile by the lady boss and after by service staff Gary. I guess my previous purchases have made it easier for me to reach out to them.The food was served without much delay and hot. The only issue I have was with the tablet, which was a little slow. The salmon sashimi were fresh and thick slices. I love the soft shell crabs. The dessert served that night was unique and delicious. At payment, we are handled a gift which is Jap Table Lamp. Place alittle busy that very evening and so I would also not penalise the lack of attention given. For the amount I paid for 3 adults and 1 child, I must said that we made it worthwhile. Would go back for dinner someday."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummy jap food!,1,50,25-Jan-16,Efficient service and delicious food. Sashimi is fresh and wide variety of food available!Will go back again
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so dinner,1,40,3-Jan-16,Food quality was good but lack of variety compare to other jap buffet need to look into the menu selection not too much pork selection and someone like beef nt much in menu. Green tea ice cream we order was nt so gd was too sweet at first we thought was jus a matcha ice cream but it come with sweet bean way too sweet for us personally. Overall service is normal during dinning in the one guy who lead us to the table I forgot to ask his name he was friendly n very helpful the rest I think need abit of training couldn't smile much. Anyway overall experience is so so if compare to other similar restaurants u way below them. Food service was good that the plus point. Hope my next visit will see a better selection. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet but read the fine print,1,40,29-Dec-15,"All you can eat Japanese buffet is a good deal at $35 per person. Of course, come hungry! Portions are smaller than other Japanese places we visit. Also, watch the fine print. .. one order of sushi from the buffet "" looks"" like you will get two pieces but you only get one. Also if you don't eat everything you order, you get charged $10 per 100 grams. Make sure you eyes are not bigger than your stomach! By the way, ask for a table by the window... otherwise, it's very dark."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Like the buffet concept,1,40,29-Dec-15,"Tried this Japanese restaurant based on the reviews. Had the all you can eat buffet. Pretty good deal if you are hungry!

Unlike most buffets it is not sat around getting all dry and horrible, it comes fresh as you order so the food is lovely and hot when it gets to you. As an experienced eater of sushi, I can say the quality of the seshimi, maxi, handrolls and everything else isreally above adverage for what you would expect from an all you can eat.The staff were great too and on hand to help, were generally polite and well mannered. Thanks again, we will be back again! :)"

They have a very wide spread and I enjoyed myself each time I visited. My only regret is when I step on the weighing scale the next day"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,1,40,21-Sep-15,"Good food, good sashimi, decently fast service when it comes to serving your sashimi, unlike other restaurants.
Unfortunately, I find it a little too pricey. It cost almost 100 dollars (inclusive of GST and service charge) for just 2 person, for a weekend dinner."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place ,1,50,11-Sep-15,"The selection of good available for the buffet is awesome, ranging from sashimi to grilled food.

The bbq grilled meats and mushrooms are also very good. We ordered close to 30 items for 3 persons! Service level at this restaurant was average. Do not expect anything more than bringing the food out to you and making payment. Every order was done via the Samsung tab. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Love the fresh buffet!,1,50,7-Feb-15,"The food was fresh. The service prompt and friendly. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening (reservation) and then ordered through iPads. The food came quick, and quite fresh. I love salmon and the salmon here was very good, with just the right amount of fat. We also had the cheese scallop which was very good and recommended. I also like the atmosphere here which is very home-y and ""uncorporate"" feel which is good. Overall the value for this place is excellent! "

I think it's great, the quality of food is better than good, but not great, but again, what do you expect?

Approx $40 inclusive taxes per person.Must try items - sashimi menu, prawn tempura and curry udon.I would rate this restaurant very good experience.The Service wasn't attentive and waitress always forgotten what order. Not paying attention to table. Fail to top up green tea. This probably because we have more than 20 persons. Service and attention to details must be consistent."
