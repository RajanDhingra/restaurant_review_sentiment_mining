Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",So so Food with Bad Service,-1,20,14-Apr-15,Decided to try out Muthu's Curry. We had initially intended to go Samy's Curry but unfortunately closed.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Food is living in past glory,-1,20,1-Jan-15,"Food quality is below average and the expansion in the number of outlets ha degraded quality of food.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Pricey good food,-1,30,25-Dec-14,The food at Muthus curry is quite tasty.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Just okay,-1,30,9-Dec-14,"Northern Indian cuisine, reasonably well prepared, but the most enjoyable dish was the naan bread.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Mediocre food and service,-1,30,8-Jul-12,Food is not freshly prepared but served from a kind of buffet. Didn't taste very well. Food served on re-sued banana leaves that feel greasy. Service was slow and uninterested. There are many better and cheaper Indian restaurants in town.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Authentic but somehow lacking abundence,-1,30,16-Jun-12,"It wasn't all that different from Samys ... but somehow eating at Muthus has always felt like a more refined experienced , but lacking that sense of ""abundence"".

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",how much salt can you get in a curry,-1,10,19-May-12,We heard great stuff about this icon of food. Our experience was sitting next to a toilet with terrible rubbery chicken and the content of a Russian Salt Mine in the food. NEVER NEVER NEVER again.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Disappointing,-1,20,13-Jun-11,"Over Priced, the food is super spicy and oily. Being an Indian, I thought the food was nowhere near authentic.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",the food is good but service extremely poor,-1,30,29-Aug-18,"As I entered the restaurant I was escorted to my table and served with water.the person who came to take the order was least bothered and was busy chit chatting with another client. We ordered our food first we received a dish that was not for us. He placed the platter and then apologized saying it was not for us. he again said it was for us, we checked and told him it wasn't then again he apologized. (was a very casual apology though). After a few minutes again he got us some food which was not hours and again we told him and then he went to another table. and finally our food arrived. The taste was good, nothing great but good food. The juice came flat and we had to tell him to get ice. normally they should ask while ordering. When we left again no smiles. above all this the restaurant had around 100 people capacity but there were only 8 guests including us so imagine this mess with 4 serving staffs. imagine with more clients. finally we went out and ate a busy food joint which was ananda bhavan trust me had great food !!! There is another restaurant called gokul which is also a good indian restaurant nearby"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible chat item,-1,10,13-Jul-18,"They only waste time ob decorating item
Very expensive
Staff not polite specially if you go in the afternoon and slow service
Bad experience ????"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average Chhat,-1,30,13-Jun-18,"We went there for Chat, but it turned out to be just OK. Lunch choices are also available with reasonable service/I will say overall Average"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The food is very tasty but also heavy so go here only if very hungry,-1,30,5-Jun-18,"We took the Bhatura platter (big mistake as the bhaturas were flat and oily) , Cholas, Paneer kadhai and a mixed vegetables. Very tasty but lots of cream and oilyWould recommend ordering Bhaturas separately as you get fresh BhaturasSeating is comfortable and service is good"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect Indian Veg food joint ,-1,30,2-May-18,It’s known for its chaat. It’s fun to be here. Just that the staff is not that efficient. There are too many errors to serving on wrong table and also the bill errors due to this. One must check the bill properly.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Tasty but spicy foods,-1,30,2-Apr-18,This place is just in front of Hilton Garden Hotel. Food is delicious and authentic but too much spicy. Its snacks and chats are superb.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Greasy and unhealthy food,-1,30,11-Feb-18,"It is a well known restaurant so when we saw it in Singapore last year, we were really excited.The place is clean with good ambience.We ordered a very light meal but it turned out to be an oily mess.I kind of felt sick after eating it and started throwing up. I had to take medicine and our plans for that day were ruined.We were highly disappointed.We visited singapore last month as well but gave this restaurant a miss. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Meh! Overpriced, unhealthy & lousy customer service",-1,10,6-Jan-18,"This used to be a good restaurant, however of late its fallen into decline. The waiting staff don't really seem to understand how food is to be served, for example if a soup and a naan bread are the only thing that is ordered by a customer. Then bring them together.. Not bring the soup first and then leave the customer with just a naan to eat.. Such nuances are not understood.I suppose this is a rather big ask from a restaurant that claims to have a worldwide presence.The food served is unhealthy and excessively oily and over priced,.several hawker centers dish out better options in Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mediocre restaurant,-1,20,21-Dec-17,"If you can, avoid it. I had two chats - bhel puri and dahi puri. Both were bad and felt kinda sick. I would not go. The problem is that part of little India has very few good restaurants."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat Paradise,-1,30,4-Dec-17,Kailash Parbat is authentic and Keeping good Indian food. Its was really enjoyed to ate Indian veg food. I like very much Cutlet and Pav Bhali its was so Delicious.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Overrated and overpriced ,-1,30,21-Oct-17,Just overrated and overpriced. Not that many choices in Singapore so people do go there- but nothing there is authentic enough for the price one pays.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average Vegetarian Food,-1,30,7-Oct-17,"Food is okay but it is not worth for it's price. Restaurant is very chaotic, had to call the waiter multiple time just to order the food !!!!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",North Indian Vegetarian Food,-1,30,26-Sep-17,Good restaurant near to Hilton. The food and service quality was average but lots of choices are available. The ambience is good with many staff.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Poor service, decent food",-1,20,24-Sep-17,"Made the mistake of stopping by at this location. While the food is fine, I would recommend going to their other location on Serangoon Rd. Much better ambience and service. We always go there with friends. At the Syed Alwi outlet, they first gave me a table and then made me move because “the group wants this table.” Turns out they wanted to give my table to five tourists. Don’t think I will be going back to this location ever again. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very std but still a decent choice..they need to just push a little hard,-1,30,3-Sep-17,"I have been to Kailash Parbat a few times. So it means its not bad and you can repeat it, but then its also pretty std stuff and what you want you need to know.Their chole bhatura platter is very good. So are their chaats. But they are pretty pricey. This time I tried their north indian food and I came away unimpressed.We ordered Garlic nanns, which even when hot have a a rubbery texture. They definitely need to look at their flour preparation. We order shaahi paneer and it was white gravy based which is wrong, no issues, the gravy is fine, not great, but its the paneer that kills it. Its not at all soft. This is a shocker. There are many places in singapore that serve very soft paneer , why cant they get it. I am sure their own chefs would admit this is not the kind of paneer that works.On top of it their rates are significantly high. for these rates I woudl rather go to another restaurant that serves much better north indian cuisine. so its a ok and decent place if you know what to order. but nothing great about it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Chaats OK, rice items a BIG No No",-1,10,10-Aug-17,"Have been couple of times to have chaats, which is Ok. One of the visits, ordered Fried Rice. It was too oily. So next visit I specifically asked for less oil in my rice. I was in for a shock, the most oiliest biryani I have ever had. Did point it out to the lady in charge, who defended it saying there was no extra oil added. We already had a tiring day, was in no mood to argue with someone who was not ready to correct. We just left the food , paid the bill and exited. The manchurian starter was over fried. Will never step in there again as they lack basic customer service."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","An average experience, food is good ",-1,30,19-Jul-17,"We went to KP, Little India, Singapore, as we were missing biriyani a lot! We arrived early to avoid waiting. We managed to slip in n get the last available table. The place was really narrow n linear, n cramped up, hesitantly rundown too.. It was extremely noisy, the place was definitely understaffed. The staff was running around, why n where is difficult to comment as public seated on each table was looking disgusted, unattended n disappointed. The food really arrived late, it was delivered to three of us at three different timelines. Food was good with KP standards, die to which I'm giving it 3 stars. Get in here only if you are looking for food 'on the go'. Avoid it completely if you're looking for fine dines or special evenings! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Horrible place, bad services, overpriced food",-1,10,10-Jul-17,"Can't express my disgust enough without being outraged. We had really bad experience, not once or twice but 3 times. 1st time in the branch opposite Mustafa - we ordered food, waited for 25 mins, they didn't serve despite repeated reminders. Funny enough, people who came after us, ate n left, but we were still not served. Finally we gave up after 30min, and manager said ""oo we forgot your order, plz wait for a few min, we will serve"". Imagine the audacity manager had to ask us to wait another 15-20 min.2nd time in the main branch on Serangoon road - history repeated itself. Can't imagine the same thing happened again!!! But this time, i was prepared to pick a bone with manager. Finally, after 3 reminders and 25 minutes later, we were served cold curry n uncooked naan. And look at the hight of shame, manager first refused to speak with us, and finally when i spoke, he wasn't even apologetic.3rd time, again at Opp. Mustafa branch - I honestly didn't want to go in this place with pathetic service, but we had to go as the group of friends decided to go there. Substandard food was served, my friends ate it, I decided to wait and go to other place.I know my review wouldn't make a big difference as there are only a handful places serving vegetarian North Indian food, but plz do look for alternatives before choosing this place. Perhaps give a try to Panchtantra or Bikaner. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Unhappy With the Taste,-1,30,28-May-17,Went there little early in the evening.Had a high expectations from the food because we tried earlier other outlet which is near to Mustafa.Ordered Gobi Manchurian. It came out to be Gobi Pakora style stuff (coated with lots of flour) which was awefull in look and wasteful in taste .Then we ordered Pani Poori . Not bad - StandardLater we decided to try Bhatura. Which was ok but not too good.Since Start was bad and mood was spoiled with Gobi Manchurian this we decided to stop there and could not order main course .Little pricy and could not find worth it for the starter quality.I might not visit this place again because there are a lot of places nearby which gives better taste.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Expensive but tasty,-1,30,27-Apr-17,Had mixed experiences with KP.. had been to their restaurant in Mumbai - not high end but tasty.. in Singapore they are quite expensive but food is tasty.. in general consistent in taste except for a few instances.. try their chole bhature and chat items.. the ambiance in their Serangoon Road branch is better thant he Syed Alwi one..
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",From my recent visit I dont think it offers good North Indian Taste!!!,-1,20,17-Jan-17,"Ragda Patties was lousy and quite cold.. no energy. Club sandwich was another disappointing experience -- in fact this was one of good item they served earlier at Syed Alwi Road. But over this place it was horrible --- the potato in the sandwich was without any masala / taste.Overall I strongly recommend the restaurant owner to improve on North Indian food / taste, food should be tasty -- have some energy!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bad food ,-1,20,25-Dec-16,"The interior of this place is really nice. Unfortunately, the food was really bad. The manchow soup tasted more like Manchuria gravy, far too spicy and garlicky. The jhalfrezi was sweet, the daal makhani too watery. The only thing that tasted good was daal tadka. The quality of the food has been consistent, it was just as unsavory the last time I dined here. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Horrible stink,-1,10,26-Oct-16,"What u don't expect as u enter a restaurant is horrible stink.. is the owner totally ignorant! Can't believe it!
I know that their food is good - have eaten at the outlet on Serangoon road near the temple - surely much better.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Poor service and serve half cooked food,-1,20,23-Oct-16,"I visited with my family to Kailash Parbat after reading reviews on trip advisor. But my experience was totally opposite We ordered Channa Bhatura. It came after 40 minutes. The chana was also hard and half cooked. The service is so slow that when we ordered extra bhatura, they took 20 minutes to deliver. Not happy at all with the service and also ambience. The ambience is also very dingi. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bad service,-1,20,20-Oct-16,"Was disappointed with the service. Had to request for everything from sugar to tissues..when asked to pack, the extra food, it was done hurridly as a result of which most food(bread sandwich) gt soaked in chutney when I reachd home"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Stale, bland and Poorly made",-1,20,19-Oct-16,"Very disappointed. The chaat items we ordered - papdi chaat, sev puri and ragada sev puri - all ingredients (especially the fried items like boondi and papdi) tasted stale and old. I have eaten at this place several times over the last 5 years and the quality of food has plummeted. DO NOT EAT HERE. Costly and horrible food. Service is only decent thing about the place. The staff is prompt. We also ordered Gobi Manchurian (no taste, pieces too big so undercooked) and fried rice (too oily, bland, cheap vegetables)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible Terrible Terrible Food,-1,10,14-Oct-16,"I heard so much about this place and I went here when it first opened (and even recently), the ""authentic"" food that they describe in the menu is not really authentic and it's really pricey. Did not like any of the food and I ended up leaving more than half the dishes I ordered. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaats and Kulfi Falooda!!,-1,30,4-Oct-16,"Great location near Mustafa, an easy stagger to this vegetarian Sindhi joint after an afternoon of fighting the scrum in Mustafa. The service is average however this is ideal for those looking for a refreshing Chai, Snacks and recovery after an energy sapping session at Mustafa next door. The Paani Poori and Paid Chaat hit the spot and the Kulfi Falooda was a hit with the kids. My eldest pronounced it the best Falooda she has ever had!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mediocre food with slow service and noisy environment,-1,20,22-Sep-16,We had a family lunch at this restaurant a few days ago. The service was slow and it was a pain getting the attention the service staff. The Hot and Sour Soup ordered tasted only of corn flour and the 2 'Panner' or Cottage Cheese North Indian dishes tasted and looked and same. The restaurant was noisy and unkept with dirty floors. I am not going back here for sure. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The restaurant was ok as food food and rude staff members,-1,30,11-Sep-16,"Staff remembers talk very rudely and do not give atuff like spoons,however food was well and good to eat"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent Service,Not that Tasty food",-1,30,6-Sep-16,"We went for Dinner on Ganesh Chaturthi. Place was crowded but we were promptly given seats.Service was excellent, very prompt and accomodating as one member ordered Jain food.Foodwise its disappointing, atleast based on what we ordered this time. Soups were tasteless (Hot n Sour, and Sweet Corn). Aloo Chat was bland in taste too.Hyderabadi Veg biryani was a big disappointment. Paneer ke Soole (Grilled Cottage Cheese) and Chinese fried rice was ok to some extent.Didnt try the Dessert."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Noisy, poor & disinterested service and bad food.",-1,20,17-Aug-16,"We ordered two fizzy drinks, a coffee, two entrees, two mains and a naan.The entrees were plain and uninteresting. Spice dusted dry potatoes with day old chopped coriander on top. Blergh. One drink (sparkling mineral water) didn't turn up so we asked for it again and got a room temperature bottled still water. Sent that back and ensued a long and boring conversation about what sparkling water is. We decided not get no fizzywater at all (there was tap water on the table already), and 5 minutes later a lime sparkling lime drink turned up (yep, one we specifically said we didn't want). The waitress honestly didn't give a rats, hardly listening the first time and not taking the time to get it right.Nowhere does it say that this is a VEGETARIAN restaurant so I've just saved you 10 mins trying to find a chicken dish on the menu. The curries we ate for dinner were quite nice - good temperature (both spice wise and temperature wise), and good portions. The naan was ok but not the best.You can see the hand washing basin to the toilets from the dining room which is a bit weird. And there is a bizarre combination of English and non-english on the menu so we could hardly work out what the dishes were. The restaurant was full of families with noisy kids so I definitely wouldn't recommend it after a long flight. Locals may love this place once they know what their favourite dish is, but it's not suitable for tourists."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian cuisine,-1,30,13-Aug-16,Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa has a good ambience and the service is good. The place gets busy on weekdays after 12 pm. Lot of families drop in with kids. Thete is a good selection of North Indian cuisine. They offer a diverse range of Sindhi dishes and chaat. The restaurant was clean and the air conditioning was doing a good job on a hot and humid day.I tried their Chana Bhatura with sweet lassi. The meal cost SGD 18 bucks with taxes. The chana bhatura consists of 2 non oily medium sized bhaturas. The chana was average as I was expecting the chana to have more interesting flavours and aroma. The sweet lassi was very good and not diluted with water that is commonplace at most joints in the Little India area. Those on a tight budget or looking for value for money are probably better off exploring other joints.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very average food and terrible service,-1,10,9-Aug-16,Thought of having snacks and tea so went there to a known place I have visited for years..this time round it was a public holiday and the place was not crowded at all..asked the staff about an item in the menu and he said it's written there just see it yourself! Each item took forever to arrive and it didn't taste as good as it used to.. Even their famous paani puri has become terrible! Staff were walking around and didn't pay attention when I call them..after the first dish everything took forever to arrive...tea wouldn't have arrived if I didn't remind and it was not even hot... Overall a big disappointment and won't bother going back there again!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Not so good food... Poor service,-1,20,9-Aug-16,The service was poor... Food taste is so so. We ordered Ali go hi which was very bland and not cooked properly. Roti tori was so cold. Butter milk very watery.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good yummy food,-1,30,7-Jul-16,Great foodLots of options to choose. Hara bara kebab was very yummy. Naan and side dish gravies were very yummy and perfectly cooked. Pani puri was very hard. Dahi puri Dahi was veri veri frozen cold.Should less oil in the gravies. Naan and chapattis tasted great. Waitress was annoying .We ordered 7 chapathis and she kept on annoying are you going to eat all or any of your Friends coming or you going to pack food for home.Which was quiet irritating and no manners.They should better teach the waitress who takes order to stop asking nonsense to customers. There are people who eat lot and 7 chapathis are not too much for 2 people. Finally food was great and she was not harsh and other people were friendly and neat clean ambience. But her way of questioning was annoying and it's none of her business to question us on are we going to eat all or pack or ordering for friends.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Do not visit if you want to eat good Chaat and Pani Puri.,-1,20,3-Jul-16,"Went to the Belilios Road outlet(there's another one on syed alwi road) today for some Chaat, Paani Puri and Desserts. The puri for the paani puri tasted oily and stale and the same for chaat platter. Complained to the waiter about it but no one really cared. The desserts were good. The only highlight of the trip. The main course probably tastes better and is probably the reason for it's popularity but I'd give it a miss otherwise."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",claustrophobic place,-1,20,27-Jun-16,"seats are clustered, heard a lot about the name but very upset with rundown service and bad quality of north indian food. Was half cooked"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",LEAST CONCERNED ABOUT CUSTOMERS,-1,10,19-Jun-16,They believe in quantity and not quality. They have created a hype to overcharge customers. I recommend TRY OTHER PLACES. AVERAGE FOOD AND SERVICE QUALITY COMPARED TO PRICES
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",horrible service and food,-1,10,18-Jun-16,"no care for the customers , only interested in collecting money . went with friends and lot of hopes but really disappointed . my first and last visit there"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average place,-1,30,18-Jun-16,It is a decent chat corner but nothing great to rave about. The prices are on the higher side. The service was pretty laid back and had to wait for dishes once the order was placed. The servers do not wear gloves and Hygiene factor could be improved
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Stale food and no feedback form.,-1,20,7-May-16,We ordered for pav bhaji and samosa. Both of them were stale... and smelling. While the restaurant manager took note.... There was no action nor ay kind of apology.... Surprisingly.... Kailash parbat does mot have a feedback form. So there kind of food quality and service matters are either very frequent to maintain track or just dont matter.Next time you visit just ask if they have freshly prepared anything and then order.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Famous Maybe Standards of Service and Chaat wose than a Dhaba,-1,30,18-Apr-16,"Our second time, in as many years. Didn't feel welcome at all as we walked in. Tired, insipid and uninterested staff. This ws at 3:00 pm when it wasn't busy.Bhel puri LOUSY! Dahi puri OK; Salted Lassi a thick slurry. Left half and it took as long to get the bill as the man who oversees chaat preparation also closes the bill!! One man dhaba moe efficient."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disappointing Chaat!!,-1,10,14-Apr-16,"I went to Kailash Parbat to celebrate my birthday yesterday with some chaat (as I love paani puri a lot). I ordered for one plate paani puri and one plate dahi puri. I was so disappointed with both these dishes. The pooris used were very hard and oily. It actually bruised my mouth. The sweet and spicy water of pani puri were nice. The dahi puri was horrible. The puri was again oily and hard, the sev used as topping was stale and smelly. The tea they served was cold. The ambiance was nice though but the chaat was a complete NO! NO!We went there with high expectations and were left disappointed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian snack food,-1,30,29-Feb-16,"Kailash Parbat offers a good variety of authentic and tasty Indian snack food. However, I think that they are overpriced."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",What's the fuss about !!!!,-1,20,21-Feb-16,Average food and pathetic service sums up this place aptly !! I am not sure why it's regarded as one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore - most dishes taste stale!! Freshness is something that is not offered on their menu and so is the service. Servers seem to have been forced to work.Give this place a miss and try out loads of better ones during your next visit to Singapore. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent Food,-1,30,7-Feb-16,"Visited this place only once, the food was decent, the sitting is ok. Their outlet at bellilos road is better"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food bit costly,-1,30,18-Jan-16,"Good authentic food. Indian taste. Slightly overpriced specially Tandoori Roti. Ambience is good. Staff is South Indian so difficult to communicate in hindi.
Chana bhatura is good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, awful service",-1,30,15-Jan-16,"The chaats are delicious - the three of us had three chaats which was one too many but the waiter was totally unhelpful with advice on the right quantities for three people. The Hyderabad biryani and curd rice were very good too, as was the dhal and bendi. But why did we feel so rushed? They kept coming to clear the dishes, kept asking if we were done and then brought the bill before we had even asked for it! Noisy. Stressful. Not returning anytime soon, but they probably won't notice. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Tea time with poor service ,-1,20,14-Jan-16,"I visited this restaurant on my way to the major department store across of it as I was craving some Masala tea. I like the Masala tea freshly made and with no sugar. I know this place makes it with both requirements. While the tea itself was what I expected, the service have much to improve. I asked for the tea from an attendant upon entering. She was counting coins and even though seemed she took the order, I wasn't sure as there was no welcoming response, and just kept counting coins. I sat down hoping an attendant would approach, but to no avail. I stood up to get the menu myself as I considered also having some snacks. Was about to walk out since no one approached and was unsure the tea order was made, but just then the tea arrived(on a cup poorly served and stained from serving the tea itself). Just decided to have the tea but no snacks. The snack options on the menu are not as varied either. During my entire stay, no one approached. The tea is good but the service has much to improve. Likely will not return either. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",VERY OIL FOOD,-1,20,12-Jan-16,"had the chhole bhature here after hearing really good reviews.
But after the meal i felt like i drank a pint of refined oil"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bit expensive for Average food,-1,30,29-Dec-15,We ordered food at our Hotel.The food was average but a bit expensive .They dont provide onions with the food which was a minus
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Veg Restaurant,-1,30,14-Dec-15,"Veg Restaurant similar to one's in Mumbai
Chole bhatura was tasty
It is located close to Mustafa centre."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible!,-1,10,30-Nov-15,"This was seriously the worst food I have ever had in my life after paying so much! The samosa was nothing to talk about, bathing in oil for I don't know how many hours, I cannot even be sure if it was made the same day! N the paratha was even worse, fully uncooked from the inside.. Forget about cleanliness if u have to visit this place.. I was so damned disappointed.. N its all so expensive, so u obviously expect good quality but that does not seem to be the case! Anyway I would never ever go back to eat here.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Vegetarian Food....and air conditioning.,-1,30,27-Nov-15,"We chose this place as it looked like they would have air-conditioning and offer some respite form the Singapore heat-and it did.We arrived late lunch and despite the sparse crowd, the wait staff were in no hurry to serve. The food however was delicious and well worth it. Pricier than the surrounding restaurants in Little India but worth it for the quality of food and the air-conditioning"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Veg (Jain) Option opposite Mustafa, Little India",-1,30,12-Nov-15,"This is a typical restaurant like we have back home (Mumbai, India). I have been there couple of times just for the craving of chaats and this is one of the few Jain food options in Singapore. Except for the taste of Indian food (almost all items) and the sweets, I did not find anything great about this place. Place looks to little cramped, and it turns out to be too noisy when full. We (6 of us) were given a table which was joint with another table for capacity of 4, so it felt like we were together and sharing meals :). Service is worse, they cannot manage when the crowd is full and the frustration will come out on one of us if we are unlucky when we ask them for an additional service like providing glasses to drink water. I believe it was a bad day for us. They messed with orders; getting some other item instead of what was ordered. And yes, cost is little on the higher side compared to other restaurants.PS: This review is for the branch they have opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road. I am not sure if Kailash Parbat has any other branch in Singapore. I have seen there are reviews for Serangoon Road Branch as well, so they might have other branch there."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fine Dining in Little India,-1,30,27-Oct-15,The place is slightly like a Fine dining restaurant in Little India. Hence it is pretty expensive compared to the other restaurants in Little India. The food is decent.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but inconsistent!!!,-1,30,18-Oct-15,"We visit this place quite frequently as part of the Little India grocery trip. I find the food to be good -- my usuals are Chana Bhatore, Dahi Puri & Lassi. Generally good -- however, I find the food quality and taste to be highly inconsistent, especially Bhatore can be oily at times. The service too is nothing to call out.Its also a bit of a struggle to manage baby chairs."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Food But Awful Service,-1,30,14-Oct-15,"Food Quality Was Okay not Awesome. The Price paid for the food was RIDICULOUSLY HIGHThe Service was a Nightmare, especially the way they bring food onto the table. When you go to a normal restaurant you will notice butlers / waiters bringing in food in a nice and clean tray, however in this restaurant you will notice a bunch of waiters / waitresses coming with a freaking attitude holding plates and bowls in dirty hands so here comes a question of hygiene. Not sure how other reviewers did not notice this. The lady who looked like an owner to me was polite enough to come and ask whether we received our food on time etc. but the overall experience at this restaurant was Awful. In addition to this, the area this restaurant is in, is the most horrible place.Will never every return here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Mixed opinion, one dish good and other dish is bad",-1,30,14-Oct-15,"First time went and had Jaipur Biryani. It was good. Second time went to other restaurant near Mustafa. Taste sucks. Tried chat platter. It was not very good. Heard great reviews and recommendations. However recently had food in a friends place catered Kailash parbat, it was great. Very inconsistent."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Taste but poor hospitality.,-1,30,3-Sep-15,"Restaurant has nice a ambience and a good food quality & taste.Avoid going at closing hours ,doing so who will be treated as you went there to eat for free.I belong to the same industry and its morally wrong to serve guest forcefully only because its a closing time."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Horrible,-1,10,8-Aug-15,"Never go; tasteless
waste of money & time; taste is not like North India
not for chat, not dinner. not even or sweet"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Aweful service inconsistent food,-1,30,25-Jul-15,"Visited this resturant many times and did not have good experience, taste if food was inconsistent, sometimes ok sometimes not good, service is awful, seems employees are not paid enough or not trained enough.
One of the ok indian vegetarian in Singapore"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",NORTH INDIAN CUISINE,-1,30,24-Jul-15,Kailash Parbat speciality is Main North Indian as well as snack dishes .It is generally well cooked & presented prompmptly .Indian Sweets are also available in the Restauarant.Restauarant Ambience & seating is well done . Size of portions in various dishes is rather meagre & just enough for two people which makes it a little costly. Also one has to carefully place order & recheck as there ia a chance of mixing orders .
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Disaster,-1,20,8-Jul-15,We had a visitor from Europe and my cousin suggested we take him to this place. It was nothing to shout about. Went back again to their other branch with my spouse. The visit just reconfirmed first impression. There is nothing special. It is good for people who want vegetarian food for nostalgic reasons. I would definitely give it a miss. Staff very helpful and friendly.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good veg restaurant ,-1,30,6-Jul-15,Its a good veg restaurant. Been there many times. Their sweets are must to have. I always go there during ganesh puja time. As they make the mawa sweets. Tasty. Service is good but sometime it gets very crowded and need to wait for very long. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Charges for onions seperatly. Avg exprnce. ,-1,20,2-Jul-15,A very average experience. They serve good quality food with a very low quality of service. The food is a bit over priced and they even charge for onion seperatly. The waiters are not warm and welcoming during the serve. Whereas the other indian restrnts in the neigbhrhood are much better. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",PATHETIC SERVICE !!!!,-1,30,27-Jun-15,"i visited this restaurant after going through reviews on trip advisor but hugely disappointed by there service. It took more than 20 minutes to get the order. Even a small request of providing plastic plate for my kid took them 15 minutes.the place is clean and can cater upto 40 to 50 guests at one go, but they have only ONE CHEF (as told by there staff to me) so if you are a a big family avoid this place because your order will take lot of time.The food was better than average, nothing I can complaint about the quality of food. but the service is awful I suggest the owner/manager of the kailash part to look into there service part as tasty food alone cannot help you build a reputation."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,-1,30,17-Jun-15,"This joint is located in busy area of Little India. It is famous for Indian fast food & sweets. Only veg items are available. It is expensive with regard to the food quality, service & ambience."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good Indian snacks joint, situated opposite Grand Imperial hotel and you can try Paubhaji and Masala chai. Nice ambience",-1,30,18-May-15,Nice Ambience and nearby hotels. Some dishes are good but some are recooked. I had bad experience of Samosa. Dripping in oil. Avoid it.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Had India vegetarian food,-1,30,3-Apr-15,Spent around 2 hours... the food was well cooked and tasty. The ambiance was good and it was not expensive. Had the feeling of India...
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",home away from home,-1,30,30-Mar-15,The place serves authentic Indian chaat. The taste was just like what you are served in India. So if you happen to visit Mustafa Shopping centre and want to splurge on Indian food the Kailash Parbat is a good option. The Cholley Bhatura are authentic so is the Chaat.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Posh Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,-1,30,19-Mar-15,"I have always heard great reviews from people about the restaurant. But when I went there, I was not very impressed. The food was fine though I would say nothing special. On the other hand, the ambience of the restaurant was very nice. I felt that the prices of the food there were exorbitant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good North Indian Food,-1,30,14-Feb-15,"Good North Indian Joint in Singapore
Chaat items and Chole Bhatura, especially Masala Bhatura is very tasty
There are variety of sweets available as well.
They are slightly costly but a good fine dine option"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",it's opp Mustafa-not Pulau Bin,-1,30,27-Jan-15,"The address given on tripadvisor is wrong. As far as the Restaurent is concerned it's pure veg and the food is not bad, but it's other branch (10 mins walk from this branch) is much better.If you decide to eat here, try Chholw Bhature, Pani Puri, Samosa Chaat, Dahi Bhalla, Sev Puri and Bhel puri in that order of preference. Apple mint and lassi are good as drinks. Desserts are not great."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good ambiance, expected more",-1,30,30-Dec-14,"Had lunch here on recommendations of a few friends. On ask in the waiter for the specials, he insisted all the items were special. Either he did not know what a special was or there wasn't one in the first place. The food was generally very good. We wanted to try Sindhi food and since our waiter wasn't particularly helpful we ordered foods with Sindhi on its name. Eat here if you know which Sindhi food you want to try out."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent chaat house, do not fall for the Punjabi Dhaba promo",-1,30,19-Dec-14,"Our son recommended this outlet for chaat. We ordered a chaat platter, which was excellent. That is what it is good at and one should stick to that.We saw a promo of the week on our table - Punjabi Dhaba at lunch. We greedily went for 'sarson ka saag' (mustard spinach) with 'makai ki roti' (corn bread) & gajar ka halwa (carrot dessert) and lassi.I mentioned to our son that the Punjabi Dhaba was a failure. His immediate response was, 'you failed falling for Punjabi food in a Bombay savoury (chaat) house. Sure our fault. The stuff was not fit for human consumption - Yucky. The service staff was friendly but casual. Chaat very good to excellent, it gets average on account of poor Dhaba."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent chaat house,-1,30,15-Dec-14,"We were craving for chaat. Our son recommended we try their recent one opened at Syed Alwi Road. Chaat platter covered everything we needed and salted lassi - was just right.We were tempted by a promotion, which the waiter said was for just this week at Mon to Fri lunch only - Punjabi Dhaaba - Sarson ka saag with makai di roti. That was a disaster!I messaged my son - chaat was very good but saag roti failed! His reply. ""You failed for having fallen for it in a Bombay chaat house"".My response, ""I should have known better, they had a disclaimer on the picture on the table promo 'presentation only for illustration purposes'. Saag seemed canned and makai roti mixed with white flour - not fit for human consumption. We should have stuck to chaat."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",go there if you are craving Indian food,-1,30,24-Oct-14,"Went to Kailash Parbat once after moving to Singapore. The food was just about average. Not as good as what you get at Kailash Parbat in India. However the food here is really costly. The staff is helpful but there is definitely hygiene issue, place can do with some cleaning and same goes for cutlery. Expensive compared to other Indian restaurants in the area."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average food and service,-1,30,15-Sep-14,"Been here once for dine in and once home delivery. Evrything we had, tastes avegrage nothing special. Service just average. Lot of paneer(cottage cheese) options in the menu and, all paneer dishes tastes almost same. Too many spices in everything. Chaats are not bad but again, nothing special. Puri for pani puri could be alot better. I would only recommend their chana bhatura which actully tastes good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible food,-1,20,24-Aug-14,"After reading good reviews and upon being suggested by a friend, went here for dinner. What followed was terrible .First up - The ambience is very good for an Indian restaurant in Singapore. Service is reasonably fast and efficient. That's where the good part ends. Now coming to food, we ordered Pani poori - very averageTikki chaat - terrible Pav Baaji - reasonably goodThai noodles -Had so much oil that you can cook for entire week for 1 person and very spicyBiryani - spicyMango lassi - reasonably goodWill never visit again."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Was expecting good quality,-1,20,23-Jul-14,"Not sure if I say poor would be fair but to my surprise it was poor at least what we ordered was not tasty at all, happened to visit kailash parbar in syed alvi road singapore in the evening on a weekday, ordered pani puri and it was awful to the core, its meant to be good for chats but I felt like I was eating plastic puris they were that hard I could feel they were not fresh at all they were literally like plastic, and the taste wasn't good, I couldn't chew in my mouth coz it wasn't even breaking it was that hard some weird taste, decided I will never eat pani puri ever in this place again, but I am assuming other dishes and roti currys will be good as they are served all day.Wouldn't recommend for pani puri at all"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",great food - poor service,-1,30,7-Jun-14,"The food was amazing, but service was ""different"": when we asked the waitress what side order she would take, she answered, none, I don't like the food in this restaurant.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Expensive,-1,30,22-May-14,"This is one expensive restaurant in little India , to pay s$ 160 for food for four person is very expensive for an average restaurant. That's more than what one pay for 5 star hotel in India. Food is okay , their chats are good . Service is not like upmarket restaurant. overall avoid if have less budget for a restaurant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible Terrible Terrible....a full grown dead Cockroach in Curry,-1,10,20-May-14,"We visited this restaurant on 13 May 14 at around 2100 Hrs, We went to its branch at Kailash Parbat Restaurant, 93 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207669 for dinner and ordered a platter of Chhola Bhattura, Hyderabdi biryani and plain yoghurt.To the worst of our experience, when we just started eating and had half a bhattura,in chhola curry I found a big dead cockroach. We reported the same to restaurant manager and he had no explanation other than just sorry. It was a major hygiene issue and even I had starting symptoms of mouth ulcer after that food.Me and my family were really very very upset with the incident as we are pure vegeterian and could not have food that night. My 6 year old daughter slept hungry that night. It spoiled our night and my daughter could not have food properly throughout the stay in Singapore in any of the restaurant due to the same suspicion.We reported the incident to the hotel admin (Mr Amit on admin@kailashparbat.com.sg sales@kailashparbat.com.sg) that night itself but his response was again just a sorry. Terrible restaurant and average food....."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good chats, value wise remain unconvinced",-1,30,18-May-14,"Went back to Kailash Parbat recently, wanting to have chats for Sunday brunch. While good and consistent food taste wise, I do think that they need to rethink their pricing a little bit. 13-15$ for a vegetable dish, 3-4$ for a cup of instant coffee and 8$ for a small serving of Kulfi probably pushes it a little bit. We tried their signature Chola Bhatura, and it is a stand out good dish. Their shahi dum aloo left a lot to be desired - chaat items are consistent as always and service was good all around."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent Food & Service,-1,30,12-Apr-14,"It's one of the few places in Singapore that offers a considerable variety of chaat and by virtue of that, has good awareness here. However, both the food and service are pretty inconsistent - could be great one day and a downer the next. Their Chole Bhatura is probably the only dish that I've found to be good every single time I've had it. What they call Hyderabadi Biryani is more like Mint-Coriander rice, and their Paneer Khurchan is a heavily gravied dish, which shouldn't be the case.This branch is still okay but the one opposite Mustafa is a disaster. The staff is not receptive to feedback at all and can be quite indifferent and rude about it - maybe one of the reasons they don't offer a survey!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic food but slightly disappointing,-1,30,11-Apr-14,"I went to Kailash Parbat thinking that I will get authentic Mumbai chaat; however, was slight disappointment. The food taste was quite contrast from what is offered in India. Also, the portions where inconsistent. Further, the variety of chaat in menu card was limited. Overall, an average experience. Maybe due to the brand name, I had high hopes. For people who want to enjoy Mumbai chaat, this is place to go provided you are able to manage your expectations."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Declining quality of food coupled with bad staff attitude!,-1,10,10-Apr-14,"We have been going to Kailash parvat a number of times since they have opened. However, the quality of food especially in this outlet (Grand Chancellor Hotel) has been on a declining trend ever since! The last we went there was last week - 2 April and after that we have sworn it off our list!For starters we ordered pani puri - which had a stale smell like the oil used to fry it was old. When we pointed it out the staff, his answer was - ""No one else has said that, so you are wrong""Secondly, we ordered food without onions and garlic and sure enough the food arrives with big pieces of onion. Thankfully it was big enough to be visible to the staff as well so he could not say that we are delusional! Without getting into too many details, the staff's attitude despite this mistake was very arrogant. The manager came in after 10 mins of argument with the staff and after being repeatedly asked for. Although his attitude was much better, the damage was done and could not be redeemed. We paid for our hardly eaten food and left immediately.While Kailash Parbat is off our list, I do know quite a few restaurants now that offer much better food minus the attitude. Try Komala Vilas in Race course road for pure veg food or Bikanerwala, Raj or Bombay cafe for better chaat options."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian restaurant in Little India,-1,30,13-Jan-14,"We were in Little India on the evening of the Dec 2013 riots. Walking around the place in the evening, we were surprised by the poor quality of restaurants and eateries in Little India. Being a Sunday, it was crowded and thankfully we spotted this restaurant which is a reasonably well known chain from India. While its facade looks average, the place is very nice from inside with efficient service, good food and stands out as an oasis where one can have a good quality meal in a comfortable, safe ambiance. While not a good place by itself, it stands miles above its local competition. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch/dinner in Little India."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lost In Translation,-1,30,11-Jan-14,"Sindhi food is generally very unique and probably one of the best Indian option. But needs special culinary skills . KP though being Sindhi food, lacks altogether the Sindhi menu and Sindhi flavors. There are few options on the menu, but that is not what one would expect from such a restaurant.Even the least of Sindhi Paratha or Rajma or Sayal Bhaji is all missing.Overprices and is ok for perhaps one visit, till the restaurant gets all the sindhi dishes on the menu.Visited the one near the Mustafa this time, but have been to the Temple hugging one in the past. Both almost same."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good decor but expensive,-1,30,10-Jan-14,Found the place to be neat and clean. Decor is quite nice. And good location in Little India. Also good variety of chaat options if u are in the mood for something different from the usual meals or heavy snacks. but price wise it is on the expensive side. So if u are on a tight budget better check the menu before settling in.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste Inconsistent,-1,30,8-Jan-14,"I believe this place has undergone some rapid change in staff, including the chef and manager. While the service staff are generally nice, the change in chef was a huge disappointment for a period of time. Food taste and quality went down drastically; to the extent that we thought that the food served was spoilt. Before that, I used to go down there almost every Saturday and Sunday for brunch. After a long hiatus, I decided to try them out a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the food tastes really good now. I wish this consistency is maintained. Ambiance is quite good and the place is easy to locate. My suggestion is to try the restaurant neat the temple and not the one behind Mustafa."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Skip the falooda, rest is good.",-1,30,23-Nov-13,"This is the restaurant outlet across from Mostaffa not the one of the main street. Bhel puri, chaat was good but the falooda was disappointing. Overall a clean restaurant and service was prompt. The mithai was good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food - The place is a bit smelly though,-1,30,1-Oct-13,"We were looking for a good indian place to have a quick bite at around 11 in the morning in the Little India area and decided to visit this place, having seen it so many times from the bus. The first impression as we entered the restaurant was about the strange pungent smell that was there in the restaurant (might have been because it was quiet early in the day). This was to a point that we thought of leaving without eating.We did stay and ordered. We ordered 2 dishes, 'Bhel Puri' & 'Regular Batore', though we were served Dahi Puri instead of Bhel Puri (and I am not someone who sends things back, afterall we are there for the good time). The food did actually turn out quiet good. The Dahi Puri's flavor was a bit all over the place and the chutneys and sweet yogurt didnt complement each other too well. The Batoore were a total treat. We loved it. Though we may not go back to this place (despite of the good food) because of the whole smell in the place."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Highly priced,-1,30,10-Aug-13,We ordered for home delivery today...we wanted to eat paneer chilly from a very long time but we were totally disappointed...it was really stale and pathetic in taste.. With such highly priced food we didn't expect such disappointing dish..!!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good only for fast food..,-1,30,30-Jun-13,"We visited the restaurant over the weekend when its highly chaotic and crowded in Little India area of Singapore. The atmosphere wasn't different inside. It was well crowded and we had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated. Never mind. We got well seated and staff was friendly too. Well, not attentive enough as compared to what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Any ways, as we made ourselves comfortable with few sips of water, we saw the ambiance was nice but hardly noticeable in the crowd. We ordered a few snacks, followed by the main course. I must mention, its a pure vegetarian restaurant, so if you fancy Indian non-veg selection, its not for you. Talking of the food, the snacks and fast food selection is nice and would remind you of food street in India, if you have been there and tried that. As of main course, its a total disappointment and doesn't satisfy any parameter of a good fine meal. Service was below average, may be because they weren't well equipped to handle crowd. So, if you are going down to this place, my recommendation would be to try street food option on menu, like Chole Bature and Chaat. If you are out to enjoy a lavish meal, you can safely avoid it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Overrated, Overpriced !",-1,10,24-Jun-13,"Kailash Parbat is highly overrated for the service, ambiance and most importantly the food it serves.Located in the heart of Little India with a finely lit up ambiance, it is sure to grab attention of on-goers (both Indian and others). It did grab our attention too for the first time I went there with my friends.Upon entering the noisy food-court like environment was a sure turn-off. I pulled my iphone to check on the decibel levels in the restaurant and no wonder it wasn’t me but it was really noisy (110 db). But looking at the number of people, it did give a sense of confidence about the place and I decided to not judge the place simply by its ambiance or comfort to my eyes/ears. We walked towards our table for 4 and we were seated in what looked like a place for not more than 2 adults. Maybe 4 kids weighing 30 kg each is what they made the table for. We successfully pushed ourselves in through the cramped up table and ordered our food. So far I was still giving the place, a second and now a third chance, banking highly on the food they will serve. After all, restaurants are meant to serve food. Other things are add-ons.After a not-so-long wait, our orders were on our table: few starters of Paneer (cottage cheese), Pani-puri, few drinks (around SG $5 for a lime juice!!). The first few bites of food added to the severe wounds of ambiance, seating and service. There is no way there will ever be another chance if the restaurant fails at its food.Pani-poori was broken and it did not hold the masala/paanis (syrups). Other chats either were tasteless or excessively spicy. Paneer was half cooked and hastily massaged with a layer of masala/garnishing. There was nothing to complain about the roti (bread), but that’s no rocket science for any restaurant. The core strength of this place as claimed is their Chat (snacks) , which was nowhere close to being even half good as what we get at any Indian restaurant.To my surprise every time I went there with an open mind to accept the place and see if anything has changed, I returned with disappointment. I made around 4 visits and now I am writing this review.The final blow was the bill which looked like injustice to what we just experienced. Overpriced!In summary: The place is a lit up version of a food court experience with food half as good as what you get in food courts, as noisy as it is in food courts and you pay three to four times of what you will otherwise spend. Food quality depicts the haste of serving you and pushing you out of the restaurant to get the next in line seated.Maybe a few non-indians may even get close to liking this place. I wont blame them, its just Indian food for them and nothing to compare against.My verdict – avoid ! Save your ears, eyes, tongue and hey, your wallet too."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Flavours away from Home.,-1,30,23-Jun-13,"Awesome food - was homesick on my singapore trip with respect to Indian food. Kailash Parbat tickled my taste buds like never before. The chats reminded us of the Kailash Parbat we visit back home in Colaba, Mumbai. The glitch was that it was understaffed, hence servicr was a tad slow - the chef had to bring out the dishes on a few occasions. Management needs to work on the same."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Waste of time and money,-1,20,5-Jun-13,Not worth it.....food is not that great....if you ask for alterations (like leass spices and all) they will never follow it!Home delivery time is 1.5 hrs and food never reaches before 2 hrs.Once i even received my entire order with out salt n that too after waiting for 2 hrs.Bikanerwala does much better job.Papri and rice flakes which they use in their chats are alwys soggy and not crispy.Boondi raita is a mix of very less curd and lots of red chilli.Masala lassi is again filled with red chilli only.Staff is most of the time too hay wired to be organised and attend to guests properly that can be beacuse vegetarian people dont have much options.Definitely not recommended if you have time and patience to wait and look around for another decent place.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best avoidable indian restaurant in singapore,-1,20,18-May-13,"After coming back from India recently my taste buds were tickling for some good indian chatpatta food ... Looking at the lay out of the restaurant and what I heard about the restaurant in radio advertising ( Of course they are paid) ... I thought this is the place best suited to give me the same experience what I had in Delhi few days back however to my surprise the food is not at all good ... Not fresh... Oily ... Forget about the taste. Even the tea took almost 15 mins to come and was clearly not fresh as I could see the clotted layer on top, when I asked to the person serving the tea..... Is this Fresh ? His reply was yes the tea is fresh however it's just served late!!!!! The Ambiance is nice however to get repeat customers ambiance ONLY will not help. For the time being I am not returning back to this place hope they make some changes.Thanks "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Highly overated, below average food.",-1,20,8-May-13,"I went to Kailash Parbat for lunch during my visit to Singapore. I ordered a 'Thali'. First the waiter said Thali is only upto 3.00 PM, I reminded him that time is 2.50 PM. He agreed to provide me with Thali.Food quality was average, very oily and spicy. Lassi was very sweet. Customers have no choice of getting plain or salty Lassi. I was provided heavily buttered roti. I was told that's how bread is served in Thali.I think its best avoidable if you do not like oily and heavy indian food!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible attitute of Staff,-1,10,26-Dec-12,"Hi called Kailash parbat today (26 dec 2012, 15:48) and was checking about the buffet arrangement. First of all the staff not respond and said check the website for any details. When i asked i had a bad experience last time but i hope this was just accidental so want to order again, the staff rudely ANSWER , THEN PLS DONT COME. Same happend in August when i thorw a party at KP and it was full of mismanagement. Foods was not served and most of the time many dishes not available and i was busy to greet my friends. I thought it was just bcoz of 1 staff member but now i KNOW whole KP staff is rude and no customer respect. FOOD IS LIKE NOT WORTHY AS THE PRICE ON TOP OF IT THE TERRIBLE STAFF."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is hit or miss,-1,30,15-Nov-12,"I was very excited to try this famous Indian chaat chain here in Singapore. The dahi puri was great, the chole samosa was not good. We ordered a few more dishes, they were not memorable. Overall, about 6 chaats, only one was outstanding. Very disappointing from my high expectations. The decor is great, very modern and clean. Nice dishes and good service. We won't go back, we will try some cheaper chaat places."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Street food is average,-1,30,19-Oct-12,"Their street Chaat items on their menu are elaborate, but expensive for $ 12 which is the price for a snack only...The main course is just average. Had taken my parents when they came but it do not think we would ever go back there as the food is very very average and prices overrated considering Singapore's wide choice of indian restaurants with very good food and prices.We personally would never go there given a choice."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pathetic and expensive food,-1,20,19-Sep-12,"This is pathetic restuarent and these guys are looting people in name of thier restaurent decoration. Only thier plate, table cloth and restaurent jhoomar(lighting) will attract you here.The quantity of serving plate food is too low and i feel the food was reheated food.I order bhel poori and i feel this was they pout maggi sous on it. No standard, not proper table service (very less staff in ratio, all serving staff passing ball to next if you ask something).IF YOU TRUST ME NEVER GO TO KAILASH PARBAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT TASTY AND REASONABLE RATE FOOD.I appriecite ""Kahansama"" who is just in front of this reastaurent for great taste and resonable rate."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","The high price of food here is only in the good looks of the food, not the taste of the food.",-1,30,5-Jun-12,"A place which deserves a miss. Just because the food is nicely decorated on your plate for you, don't make the taste nice or expensive. These guys here are literally slaughtering their customers in Singapore dollars and having the last laugh at their customers. Every Singapore dollar is now 45 rupees and to be paying s$30 for 2 plates of pain puri and a glass of lime drink equates to 1350 Indian rupees. So keep laughing guys! It's matter of time before we laugh at you."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chats are disappointing!,-1,30,10-May-12,Kailash parbat being an Indian chain is popular for its Chaats. Our first visit to KP (last year) made sure we are a regular visitor to this place but after that all visits have been highly disappointing.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tourist place, similar menus, ok price",-1,20,7-Aug-18,"The menus and stalls all selling the same items, more or less. Seafood, satay, grilled stuff, prawn mee, carrot cake. there are some other options but quite few. Food can be expensive and can be similar depending on items. Quality and taste not really good and don't really think it's a good show of all the food in SG. Good place to hang out with friends."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go for lunch,-1,30,27-Jul-18,"This is primarily a place to go for dinner, as 2/3 the stalls are closed at lunchtime. Rather disappointing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful,-1,20,1-Jul-18,A group of us well travelled business people who were there for FHA and another government sponsored conference decided to go to experience the local flair. Unfortunately there are some very unsavoury operators there and it ruined our night. I would say that at least...More
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",All under one roof,-1,30,24-Jun-18,"If you are short of time and eager to see the varieties of food the Singapore has to offer, can can do that here at one go. However, since this is a touristy place, be ready to pay a premium vs other better deals in...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey and somewhat overwhelming,-1,30,5-Jun-18,"This hawker market is really more for tourists than locals and as such the prices are much higher than the markets locals would eat at. The proprietors are outside their stalls touting which makes it difficult to walk around, read the menus and select what...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The mall is a better option ,-1,20,1-Jun-18,"Really disappointed , the food was really quite bad and very expensive !
Unfortunately we were sat next to a group of teenagers who a vendor was happily selling them alcohol... was shocked by this in Singapore.
Satay was minuscule and calamari was coated in...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quite expensive,-1,30,29-May-18,"This place is located across the road from Newton MRT station. To get here, you need to cross the over head bridge. There are many stalls here which sells a huge variety of delicious seafood ranging from clams, crabs to even giant prawns. But the...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Singapore is soo expensive now, so why should this place be any different?",-1,30,23-May-18,"We were so looking forward to having King Prawns, so came to Newton to get our fix. But we might as well have stayed in NZ, or gone to Australia, as the prices were outrageous. S$40 for 2 King Prawns!?! That dream faded fast. So...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too Commercialised,-1,10,8-May-18,Visited Newtons Food Centre tonight. Very dissatisfied. So over commercialised its lost the Songapore charm and feel. Vendors are pushy and disinterested in being polite and happy. Food very average or not good. Can't say much for this place or any of the hawker centres we've heard so much about. Wouldn't recommend or return to any of them sadly. Visited Singapore a couple of times now and have to the food is definitely not as it used to be
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced,-1,20,24-Mar-18,"Whilst not a complete ripoff, the dishes are definitely way overpriced.For example:Chicken Fried rice Newton: $20Chicken Fried rice Tanglin Mall: $6Food quality is only average, or maybe it’s the price leaving a slightly bitter taste.There are a lot of locals there, which indicates they are either happy to be charged 3-4 times more, or they are getting a different priced menu to the tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go a s a tourist as they rip you off,-1,10,2-Feb-18,"It's one of those places you feel you should go but it's expensive and they load the prices for tourists, only ever go for fixed prices and avoid the ones marked that you pay by weight as they always add S$20 on the price. Meal was very average to be honest."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Well, not much, very touristy ",-1,20,26-Jan-18,"Honestly, average quality food here. Or I should say in general Singapore local dishes is not that good. If you been to northern Malaysia, that will be a real deal.Expensive, tasteless, dont have any distinctive characteris in the food. Well, if you dont mind the above, please visit then. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience,-1,30,20-Jan-18,"A local friend brought us here for a midnight snack, and it was fun with a lively atmosphere. I stuck to the ""carrot cake"" as it seemed a safe option, and it was actually really tasty (I will try to make it at home now I think). My boyfriend ate loads of things, BBQ stingray amongst others, and he raved about it although the day after he really suffered with a bad stomach upset, he thinks it was the mutton soup but it's hard to say as we were eating out lots and he eats seafood wherever he goes. So I would say eat here as a thing to tick off the list but choose wisely."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",busy but food was disappointing ,-1,20,28-Dec-17," i was looking forward to taking my wife to a hawker centre to try some great food including the chilli crab, now it is only a hawker centre but my previous experience in singapore is that they have been very good , I checked this place out on trip adviser and took the MRT to get there. Arrived , all good , busy and a good vibe however the food was not good in fact it was far from good . perhaps we were unlucky with our choice . However i would suggest that unless you have been recommended a place at the centre, really don’t care or happy to just risk it i would think carefully about this centre - there are other choices .If you decide to go i hope that you have a better food experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very average,-1,30,16-Dec-17,Tried a few stalls and the food was very mediocre. Had the curried skate wings which were the best of the variety of items we ordered. Certainly not the Singapore hawker food of past. This is OK for a visit if you want to say you tried a hawker center but not a must visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit over hyped,-1,30,2-Nov-17,"Went with a local who eats there alot. Mixture of locals and tourists. Large open area with tables. Tables also available along the edges next to the stalls. Try to get a table in the open area as it's less stuffy. Have someone save your table as you browse all the food stalls and then switch. Lots of options, though most offer the same fare. Prices are reasonable but I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the food. Make sure you bring your own tissues/napkins as they are not offered there."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cut throat pricing,-1,20,3-Oct-17,"For tourists, take my advice, do NOT visit Newton Hawker Centre in Singapore. Because there are mamy tourists visit this centre, the hawker will tend to charge you at a sky-rocket price (especially the seafood stalls) than the local. If you are not aware, they may charge you $100- $120 per king prawn. If you really want to eat here, ask for the final price first before they cook.The taste of food here is of average standard. I personally prefer other hawker centres like Maxwell Hawker Ctr (they serve mainly lunch, no dinner)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable food at reasonable price,-1,30,17-Sep-17,"We were jet lagged and needed a simple meal close to our hotel so ended up here. There are other hawker centres that are better, but we were all able to find something we wanted to try and enjoyed what we ate and drank. Place was clean with lots of staff clearing tables etc."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,-1,20,14-Sep-17,"Great food but really, what a rip off. Go to Whampoa Hawker once, and this place will feel like you're paying like a Michelin Star restaurant in London. This place is purely for tourists who want to say they've eaten like the Singaporeans do. It's probably 3 x more expensive than it should be. No Singaporeans eat here!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",newton food centre,-1,30,20-Jul-17,"Food is fresh and cooked good.
Prices are above average.
No smoking.
Beer is available.
Taxi are difficult to get after 8pm.
Mrt nearby.
Clean toilets.
Generally its okie."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Undercooked Satay,-1,30,20-Apr-17,"Went for a dinner in this newly renovated hawker center in Newton. My colleague and I, ordered different dishes in one of the sea food . He ordered also satay in one of the Halal Satay stall. But lo and behold, the satay taste was disgusting. Its undercooked and taste like a raw mutton and chicken too. I spit out some of the portion and did not bother to touch others. I believe this is the worst satay i ever taste. Other dishes like the chilli crab were okay, but the bun they gave also not fully baked. I was so disappointed coming back here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere and cheap beer,-1,30,13-Apr-17,It is always packed whenever we go there. It is hit and miss with the stalls - we normally find an Indian stall and it is usually pretty good. Watch out for the rip offs but it is one of the iconic places in Singapore.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced for what it is,-1,30,4-Apr-17,We hit many hawker centres across the city and this one was by far the most expensive.Our taxi driver had warned us they have had issues with ripping customers off here - I can see why. The beers and water were significantly pricier than elsewhere.The food was good but not the best we had in Singapore. It was full of locals but actually seemed the least authentic of the dozen hawker markets we visited. I say this because it was the only one that had true hawkers trying to sell us their wares. This is what made it feel as though it was staged for those looking for this experience.It seemed to mainly cater for seafood which is all well and good but for me variety truly is the spice of life. There is nowhere near the choice of the likes of Amoy Street.We ate at Alliance Seafood (in the Michelin Guide) which I cannot deny was very nice - the prawns were very tasty indeed. Shame we left Newton wishing for more.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",All Newton Centre stall owners are much too pushy,-1,10,13-Mar-17,Very disappointed because stall owners kept pushing menus in our faces. I will never visit this hawker centre again
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touristy. Overpriced ,-1,30,12-Mar-17,The food is average. Prices are crazy high compared to other hawker centres. Nestled in the middle of expat hamlets and orchard road - it's a convenient hawker centre. Food is acceptable - similar to Lao pasat. Staff are not friendly.If you can I suggest chomp chomp or Adams road. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Memory lane visit,-1,30,25-Feb-17,Memory lane visit - still very popular - and has a wide range of food. Tidied up since old days. Worth a visit for the feeling.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus has had its Day....Long ago!!,-1,20,13-Feb-17,"Visited Singapore in January 2017 and stayed at an AirBnB accommodation in Novena. Newton Circus Hawker market was about a 10-15min walk away and in the evening was a pleasant walk.On arrival at Newton Circus as you walk in there are signs which state ""No Touting"". From the minute we walked past that sign we were constantly harassed until we found somewhere to sit. The variety of food is not to bad but predominantly seafood but beef, chicken and pork are available if you look around. It is imperative that you confirm prices as they can suddenly change for an unsuspecting tourist. The Indian food was to die for but the rest was fairly plain and nondescript but the kids seem to like it and it was easy.The overall feel of Newton Circus was that it had had its heyday and it looked and felt old and well past its use by date and is need of a clean both in stalls and atmosphere. having spent 9 nights in Singapore we ate here twice and the second time was due to necessity and not by choice due to a long day at Legoland and the train stopped at this location. We ate at far better places including La Pau Sat and China Town."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Different experience,-1,30,12-Jan-17,"Well we decided that we would go and have some dinner at the Newton centre. I had been there 30 years ago it would be similar, then it was very much like to the seafood marking where we could choose our own food and They would cook it in front of you. However it is quite different now and the selections are very similar across the board. It was hot and could not find a table so we left. It was quite cheap however."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a let down,-1,20,8-Jan-17,This place is way more expensive then the maxwell road hawker centre but it does have alot of seafood dishes. We went on a Sunday for lunch and only about 1/4 of the places were open. Head to maxwell toad hawker centre for better food and cheaper prices. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive tourist trap,-1,20,30-Dec-16,"Food quality is really quite poor : stingray was old & smelly , sambal was straight out of a bottle ; vegetables were old & woody ; satay was mediocre etc etc Very very expensive Far better places to eat in Singapore than this tourist trap"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's an institution ??,-1,30,10-Nov-16,"Newton Hawker Centre has become a must visit on the tourist check list. I've been visiting for the past 35 years. The food is varied and affordable. But like most street food it's invariably acceptable quality. The centre is open well past midnight so it's a popular late night option. Local favourites include oyster omelet, sate, chicken rice and a wide variety of sea food.It's prudent to check what the ordered items will cost while ordering "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A tourist trap,-1,20,31-Oct-16,Disappointing experience. This hawker centre is not what it used to be. It now caters to tourists looking for sea food. Most stalls sell sea food...which also means there's a big competition amongst hawkers and you can feel quite intimidated by them trying to make a sale. There are much better places to eat in Singapore. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap,-1,20,31-Oct-16,"I guess it would be correct to say, one gets what one is paying for. Still I think in Singapore, One can get a more satisfying meal for the same budget elsewhere. I was surprised to see many locals here too but I won't be back."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and should be,-1,30,24-Oct-16,"This is a cheap eat, and it should be. The quality ordinary. The shellfish I had and on previous occasions looks great but lacks flavour, I suspect all farmed and I don't dare ask where (or how). I enjoy watching the life at this place and how the stall owners work. A different view of the world."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A good place to go,-1,30,12-Oct-16,Always a decent food court. Never disappointed and the food is always acceptable. The chili crab is 1/3 the price of Jumbo Restaurant and I think it tastes much better when eaten with fried ManTo.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for a quick cheap eat,-1,30,13-Sep-16,There is plenty of choice and the food seems fresh. Its very tasty and everyone is catered for. Definitely worth a visit for a cheap eat.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist-trap food centre,-1,30,8-Sep-16,"Newton Hawker Centre was my least favourite of the 6 food centres we visited during our recent 4-day holiday to Singapore.It was hot and very busy on the Friday night we were there....the aromas of cooking food filled the air.There was nothing wrong with the food we received....in fact it was quiet impressive. BBQ stingray....black pepper crab and satay.......all were delicious. Prices were reasonable....but not as cheap as other centres.I think it was the atmosphere here that was the biggest let down for me.....all the stall holders are out the front of their stalls touting. It was the least ""authentic"" of all the food centres we visited. As a tourist......don't let this be your only food centre experience in Singapore.....there are so many better options for you to try!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Expensive, touristy and hot!",-1,30,21-Aug-16,"It's one of the obligatory stops when bringing tourists around Singapore. This one is just off the Newton MRT stop (one away from Orchard) and is almost always packed - not with locals but with tourists. Yes, the cereal prawns are tasty, the satay tender and salted egg crab really yummy but if one would cost SG$60++, then I will have to refrain from coming back. If you find yourself here, best to look for a table ans order from any of the establishments circling the center. The ""uncles"" would gladly cook your orders and deliver them to your table. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not what it used to be,-1,30,20-Aug-16,"Went to Newton Hawker Centre for dinner. This place used to have a wide variety of very decent food at reasonable prices but now seems to be predominantly seafood stalls, drinks stalls and one or two others. Some of the traders persistently tout their stalls despite the rules against this, and others can be quite aggressive about pushing you towards their stalls. The food is pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. We had some decent satay, but the drinks (fruit juices) were watered down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Bog-standard, overpriced, not authentic, unhygienic",-1,10,20-Aug-16,"Any shopping mall food court offers better value than this dump! Despite being heavily promoted by the STB, this crummy food centre is not truly representative of SG food. Even Lau Pa Sat is better than this."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chaos in the crowds,-1,30,30-Jul-16,"We recently revisited this hawker centre on a trip to Singapore. Granted it was a Friday night but boy were we shocked with the crowds. We could not find a seat anywhere and spent twenty minutes looking for two seats. Once you find your seat, you can proceed to order your food. We had satay and I had to have the spicy stingray. My husband had nasi goring and it was all fine. I have to say the place was super busy and we waited longer than usual for our food. It was definitely an experience and was good to eat at this long standing Singaporean institution. I would recommend not going on a Friday night unless you are in early as it was crazy! It's also very cheap and I would also suggest pinning the seafood stalls down to a price before ordering. Some of them don't have menus with prices on them and I think this is a bit risky customers. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Late night supper & drinks,-1,30,28-Jul-16,"You may find this place cheap and value for money while gathering with friends. I usually have beers with friends after work here. However, for seafood lover, remember to ensure the prices before you ordering. Some seafood stalls will charge foreigner higher prices. They open till late night so it's a great place after late work. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pretty good,-1,30,24-Jul-16,"There are many many different stalls here. Hence, the quality varies. When you get a table, stalls selling seafood will pass you their menus. Ignore if you are not interested. Choose what food you would like and remember to give the stall your table number. Some of the food is top quality stuff, so choose wisely! Furthermore, the food centre looks much better after the recent renovation."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a tourist trap,-1,30,23-Jul-16,"At first glance, it's a nice place to get a variety of local fares in one location, with nice open air seating. But it's a bit of a tourist trap, with some of the food being too expensive for local standards. I do have some friends who come from overseas and hear from word of mouth to come here, but for the same variety of food, I'd prob take them somewhere else to get cheaper food, such as Chomp Chomp or even East Coast. But if you do choose to eat there, some of the local delicacies to order include: BBQ Sambal Stingray, BBQ Chicken Wings, Hokkien Mee, Carrot Cake and sugarcane to wash it down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an open air place to dine local fare,-1,30,9-Jul-16,"took a few Aussies for dinner to sample the array of local and regional fare available.
A bit of a disappointment unfortunately."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Less than expected,-1,20,4-Jul-16,"When I first came to Singapore I visited many Hawker centres, then I visited Newton to see what the hype was about. Sadly, I was met with pushy vendors, expensive prices, disposable plates, small serves compared to the many other ""non-tourist"" hawker centres. Get a bus further up Bukit Timah Rd to Adam road and try the hawker there - it's so much better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A huge grouping of local eateries,-1,30,28-Jun-16,"You can get many things to eat of a Malay-Chinese nature. Just go around and choose what you want, they'll bring it to your table. The quality is not the best but it is authentic and colourful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",I'm a Hater. But stop harassing me for overpriced food,-1,10,19-Jun-16,"This is good for tourists. It appears cheap. You can get good quality meals for $10-$15. I've been here 3 times now. I'm over it. The food is just like most other hawkers but it's more expensive for all food and drinks at this place. And the hawker people heckle you to buy. I hate being heckled or having menus shoved in my face or someone saying ""my food is good for your tummy, boss"". If you want good seafood without restaurant prices like Jumbo, then go here. If you're a tourist, this is a good first experience to hawkers. Otherwise, I would never tell someone to go here. I hate this place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This was okay,-1,30,16-Jun-16,"I came here probably an hour or so after the lunch rush, so not many people were around and about two thirds of the stalls were closed. I definitely wouldn't characterize this as ""cheap street food""; the prices were comparable to restaurants with similar fare. I had some kind of noodley stir fry thing from a place that claimed to have ""Famous Muslim Food"". It was tasty. This is very convenient to get to by MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Out with the old,-1,30,27-May-16,"Went to Newton to see its latest incarnation,a bit too sanitised for us.It was Mothers day weekend and very busy. We were instantly bombarded with large menus in our faces from stall holders, it gave you no chance to have a good look at all the stalls. Found a shared table eventually, ordered the food and then went for drinks.The prices we paid were nearly 50% more than Maxwell rd. and it was mostly seafood on offer, we also like to pay for food as we order it, the people on the other end of our table were having a dispute with a stall holder about overcharging them.A good halfway house between Maxwells or Lau pa sat and a restaurant."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",More expensive than other hawker centres ,-1,30,22-May-16,"A lot of seafood served here so ideal if you want seafood, not as much variety and seemed more expensive than other hawker centres iv been to. Just across the road from Newton train station"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newly Refurbished Seafood Hawker Centre,-1,30,19-May-16,"A good hawker centre for seafood. We went on Mother's day so it was very very busy, our last visit was 15 years ago and sadly IMHO it had changed for the worse. I now much prefer Maxwell, Chinatown or even some of the enclosed food centres. It was busy mostly with locals so they can't all be wrong. Because it specialises in seafood the meals are generally more expensive than other centres. But not really expensive compared to restaurants. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonably delicious food,-1,30,1-May-16,"Opened on 24 April 2016 after renovation. Been a regular there for many years, prices are not very cheap. Be careful, especially the stall owners and touts like to overcharge foreigners, although that happening now is lesser as stalls face punishment if they tout. Follow the queues. Sporeans are food junkies. They know where is the best food. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ripoff,-1,20,1-May-16,This is a classic ripoff hawker center. You need to challenge the prices if you are a foreigner because they always try to cheat you. I used to live very near and went there many times. Just beware
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable but not the best,-1,30,21-Apr-16,"Newton is a tourist food market in my opinion, the taxi drivers will try to take you there if asked where is a good place to go. There are plenty of stalls to choose from and don't worry about the stall owners hassling you just find a seat then walk around the stalls to see what you like, the routers will try to get you to sit in their stall location. The food is very good and a reasonable price but can get better else where cheaper. It is an experience to say the least. Take a taxi or the MRT is right there as well so easy to get to. Funny enough we have den there several times and stall 69 s eels to be a good place to site and eat but have a look your self before choosing.There are clean toilets on site which us a bonus"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful on the per 100g prices,-1,30,20-Apr-16,"We lived close by for quite a while so we went here now and again, the food is ok but its so easy to spend a lot if you start ordering what they are famous for - seafood. Many of the prices are per 100g and the cost quickly adds up. Its worth a visit but you definitely need to confirm the price before you order. The vendors will let you run up a bill before they let you know"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware of overpriced items,-1,30,20-Feb-16,"Very good variety of local food. However, tourists must beware. Some of these hawkers will sell you food that are way overpriced. Eating in a hawker centre should be a cheap and affordable experience. Not an expensive one. Check prices of items before ordering and you will never go wrong."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food court - good atmosphere,-1,30,18-Feb-16,"Decent food court that seems to specialise in seafood. Not as much of a tourist trap as expected, although not the cheapest food for hawker centre. Food was ok quality however, and lots of choice. A good stop for my first night back in Singapore!Was very busy, but there are lots of tables, so seating rarely an issue. It does have a good feeling about it though, not quite so drab and functional as some of the other hawker centres in town. Good place to get acclimatised."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Total Rip off,-1,10,7-Feb-16,"This place is a total rip off and tourist trap. Food is average at best. Go to other hawker center for better experience such as Maxwell, Tiong Bahru, etc. The locals don't come here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hit and miss....,-1,30,5-Feb-16,Some vendors are bad. Some are good. This is a tourist trap. Prices are higher than other place. If you want to try chili crab and xereal prswns. Expect to pay around 100 sg. 40 sg for crab 25 to 40 for prawns depends on size of plate you order. Tables always full but you can find a seat. Alot of people eat and leave. Tried to order satay from 1 vendor told me sold out... but had alot of sticks still in stall.Tried to order oyster egg. Vendor told me dont order unless you willing to wait 30 mins. Crab was nothing special. Boiled crab. Pour chili sauce on it.Cereal prawns. Fresh and ok... but not my type of dish.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lifeless at lunch and not an environmental friendly food center compared to Whampoa Food Center,-1,20,20-Jan-16,"We explored the Newton Hawker, Lau Pa Sat and a local hawker center called Whampoa Hawker Center during our recent trip to Singapore. Amongst the 3, we rated Newton the lowest. We visited Newton and Whampoa for lunch respectively. Whampoa, which is connected to a local housing estate, has long lines in many stalls during lunch and is full of life. We were indeed on our way to Newton and the taxi driver recommended Whampoa instead of Newton. We tried the Hainanese boneless chicken rice, and the spicy turnip, peanut, bean sprout, pineapple salad at Balestier Road Hoover Rojak, made famous by HK movie star Chow Yun Fat. All utensils are reusable, a big thumbs up from our family as we care a lot about the environment. The atmosphere is friendly, pricing is affordable and the service is great. The next day we made a trip to Newton because of our positive experience at Whampoa. Over 2/3 of the stalls at Newton were not opened, so it's pretty lifeless. We had a Ba Kut Teh (pork rib soup) and a roasted chicken rice. Food quality was okay. Yet the food stalls in general use a lot of disposable utensils and styrofoam. It is not at all impressive. Please also note that Newton will be closed for renovation from Feb - Apr 2016."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive and a rip off,-1,20,17-Jan-16,"Stall 82 (Lucky) served up some good BBQ sting ray with sambal sauce. They charged us $14 per butterfly prawns which was tasteless and tough after being overcooked. They had sprinkled on some half cooked garlic for flavour. Massive rip off. Stall 73 served a tasty oyster omelette but you only get a very small amount of oysters. Stall 13, the famous duck noodles was salty and the saltiness was so overpowering. Their curry char siew, nothing to write home about. So disappointing. Other hawker centres have much tastier and cheaper food. Will not come again even if it is just around the cnr from home."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Varieties of different Foods,-1,30,13-Nov-15,"Went to Newton Hawker Center where the choice of food is endless ranging from Malay, Chinese, Curries,and many desserts. At each table there is number, which you need to inform food staller so he can bring your order. Please bring your own napkins as I found out that most eateries do not supply .The food at Newton Hawker Center is relatively inexpensive. We had Hainese Chicken with rice which cost about $5 and also Tom Yum Shrimp noodle soup for $5 for dinner. Both dishes were Ok, but you can do better Lau Pau Sat Food Center which has over 200 food stalls and it is cheaper."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Locals tell me to avoid this place - A tourist trap,-1,30,1-Nov-15,"And so I do, Unless I want thai from 52. The only thai place there. I like the green curry with rice. The store owners are in your face and off-putting for my liking. And even the local paper claims that they overcharge. If you want what the locals like go to Tekka centre. The bus 66 or 67 from newton will take you there easily within 5 minutes. I found the best Garlic naan and chicken tikka.Hawker centres are warm so be ready with a hanky or two."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overhyped & overpriced,-1,30,20-Oct-15,The food is mediocre and the location unimpressive. Merely targetting the gullible tourist. I'd give this place a miss and opt for takeaway from the neighbouring 7/11.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","SHOP 70, NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT SINGAPORE CAN OFFER",-1,20,6-Sep-15,"I have been going to Singapore for over 40 years and have always had a good opinion of the people and the food over the years, so much so that I suggested to my friend on her first visit to Singapore that we eat at Newton Hawker centre for dinner. I had a Thai meal which was lovely but my friend fell for the slick, smooth talk of the lady serving on stall number 70. As is normal you pay by the weight in seafood but I doubt that any stretch of the imagination could accept that one prawn cost $22 as the serving lady said it was 150 grms - firstly that was added up incorrectly and when we pointed that out to her she flew into a rage saying that my friend was getting it cheap, secondly that was the end of the service - no cutlery, no drink, no serviette and rude whispering behind my friend's back, plus having the fan moved from us to them. It was a particularly humid evening. I do not know if the owners of that stall realized how much their shop will be effected by a rude and aggressive employee but I do know that the owner next door to them was very apologetic to my friend over the rudeness of the employee in shop 70. A word to everyone - ask to watch when your prawn or other seafood is weighed and also make sure that the maths are correct when you get the bill and do not be afraid of speaking up if it is not right.  Would I go back again - probably not because I have been to a lot of hawker food areas in Singapore and I think that Newton has out priced itself for no good reason and unless you travel by train it is very difficult to get a taxi in that area."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",not spectacular,-1,30,19-Jul-15,"The location was great in relation to our hotel (Sheraton), however comparatively speaking, the food were ok at best as nothing stood out, and the highlight of the night was the Pale Ale."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap frequented by locals,-1,30,30-Jun-15,"While not how it was in it's hayday, the food quality and value are exceptional on different ends of the spectrum. Food is excellent and fresh but you could get the same dishes for 25% of the price from other more local hawkers. I would recommend this as a stop for tourists, but not a replacement for Little India or China Town. Be sure to wash down your meal with large Tiger."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not as it used to be, but still, great 24 hour seafood place!",-1,30,30-Jun-15,"There's not as much selection of food as there used to be - more seafood but if that's what you're looking for, Newton Hawker Centre is great! Also, 24-hour Singaporean local food choice near town so very convenient for a late night snack!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Priced for tourists - be aware,-1,30,4-Jun-15,Food quality is good but most of the seafood stalls (for which Newton is known for) charge exorbitant prices because the centre is popular with tourists. It is near Orchard and regularly on the tourist 'must do' list.If you really want good seafood try the East coast seafood centre which has a better ambience and probably similar prices.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A favourite now a disappointment,-1,30,11-Apr-15,"This is our 10th visit to Singapore and about our 8th to Newton. First time was when the stalls were makeshift with dirt floors. All modernised and clean now. We always go to #36 Michael, the stall owner with dyed hair, a different colour each time we visit. Usually he serves our choices (mine always Chilli crab) just perfectly. Not so this time. My crab was quite black, eggs and dead mens fingers still present in sauce. Meat too well cooked, so tough and legs dry. Sauce was just mushy. Everything now served on polystyrene plates, food goes cold quickly. First time ever I've left a lot uneaten. We ordered satay sticks first and they came after husbands main course, which was fried calamari. Looked a good portion on plate, but found much of it was deep fried onion rings.Can't help but think standard may be slipping as resting on good reputation of the past. Will have to think twice about returning on future visits to Singapore, especially when so many other centres are popping up with good food and good value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Okay tasting local food, but all located in one hawker centre",-1,30,27-Feb-15,"I visited Newton Hawker Center on 26th Feb and at 730pm, the car park was almost full and the parking attendant was making his rounds and issuing parking fines! Do note, they do not have a gantry system, so have your parking coupons ready!There are a lot of BBQ Seafood stalls in Newton and most of them sell the same stuff. Do note that though they tout and push each shop, every customer has the right to say NO! The touters get commission based on what they sell to you. To avoid getting cheated, pay upon ordering and INSIST so, else you might end up with a 3 digit bill at the end of your meal, with no explanation.Here's a review of the food we shared amongst 6 people.The Ocean BBQ #01-016 We just picked the stall we sat right next too, but I did notice that the stalls facing the inner circle seemed to be more popular. This ocean BBQ, is one of the outside stalls facing the car park.1. Lemon Chicken $15I loved lemon chicken and we ordered this. Expecting to be a thick chicken cutlet, I was surprised to see it served as fried cubed chicken. Some pieces were of the thigh meat, hence more flavourful, some pieces were breast meat and very dry. The sauce itself was decent, very lemony and you can taste the slight blend of honey. But I guess having cubed-sized chicken makes it easier for sharing.2. Sambal Singray $15My friend mentioned that the sambal was nice and it was! It was slightly sweet and for someone like me who doesn't eat spicy. This was the perfect sambal stingray for me! The stingray was meaty and the meat was easily separated from the bones. 3. Sambal SotongA similar sauce from the stingray was stir fried with the sotong, hence making the sotong abit sweet. The sotong tasted fresh and the serving was big enough for the 6 of us to share. Chances is, I might hit this stall up again, the next time I'm here. Definitely in love with their sambal!Bedok 85 Fried Oyster #01-0401. Oyster Omelette $5They were very generous with the oysters, The egg was crispy on the top layer, but on the bottom layer, it was soggy and was very mushy. I didn't quite like it in the end. If you want really good oyster omelette, try Kim Keat at Bradell.2. Carrot Cake White/black $4Even though their sign boards still says the carrot cakes are sold in $3 portions, They have increased their prices. The black had alot more egg and was sweet. The white wasn't crispy and tasted bland. Overall, another upsetting local dishKwang Huat #01-015 My friend was patiently waiting for this stall to open at 745pm! And at 730pm the owners were ready to take orders, but we didn't get our food till about 750pm.1. Hokkien Prawn Mee $5For $5, you get a satisfying plate of prawn mee with a lot of gravy, and 4 big prawns. The gravy is truly tasty and yummy. Although you can tell they did not use any lard, so it's missing that special taste. Some sotong and egg is what you get with the prawn mee, no three-layer pork meat either. I guess this stall is now muslim-friendly. 2. Char Kway Teow This was a rather OK dish at best. I couldn't taste the wok-hei and there were a lot of cockles and no other ingredients, there were like 2 slices of 50 cent coin sized fish cakes.. I do not like cockles, so I found this very upsetting. Char Kway teow to me is my most favourite dish in Singapore but I wouldn't come back here for this.Singa Cafe #01-014 Their sugar juice drinks are $1.50 and can drinks are priced at $1.50. Very reasonable pricingSoursop Juice $2I loved that their soursop juice was full of soursup meat. The drink was served with a plastic spoon, which you will need to scoop up the fruit.For those unknown to the benefits of soursop.Soursop contains a number of natural substances that have biological benefits such as, relieve stomach distress, fever, pain and respiratory problems such as cough and asthma.TKR #01-030 After walking around, we realized the prices were standard for the chicken wings $1.30 and 60cents per satay. We decided to go with TKR as it was a chinese stall, which meant they sold pork satay!1. Pork/chicken/mutton Satay 60 cents eachWe ordered 10 sticks of pork, 10 sticks of chicken and 10 sticks of mutton which added up to $18, and they gave us 5 bowls of satay sauce. The pork satay had alot of fats in them, which for me, I actually enjoyed. For the health conscious, you might want to just take the chicken sticks, which were more tender. The mutton was considerably drier than the chicken and pork, but it didn't have the weird smell. So I was okay with it.2. BBQ Chicken wings $1.30 eachThe chicken wings were pretty good. I enjoyed the crispy roasted skin. The meat was very juicy and I felt that for BBQ chicken wings, these weren't too oily and is a good choice for me! I've had BBQ chicken wings dripping with oil and that's usually the reason why I avoid them.They were presented very nicely on the styrofoam plate. They definitely gave some thought into present"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Carrot cake,-1,30,22-Feb-15,Awesome carrot cake and pepper crab. Enjoyed the meals with family and friends. Quick service. Wish it was cleaner.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not like the old place, bit of a rip off",-1,30,14-Feb-15,"Last time we were in Singapore we visited the original Newton Circus hawker market. It was great food,great atmosphere and fantastic value for money. The new sanitised version is OK, but comes no where near the original. Food was advertised as very reasonable however when you ask for the bill it has shot up dramatically. We had; small rice, small noodles, large shrimp, chillie shrimp and spicy chicken. We expected about 75 to 80 Singapore dollars, it came in at 120??? No written bill and no explanation . Food is ok but you can eat better and cheaper in the city."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This place is for tourist,-1,10,28-Jan-15,"It suppose to contain alot of local food, but that is for tourists.
And the price is cater for tourists too.
Head for hawker that most local will go, cheaper price but good food, examples are alexandra food market, brickworks market (ACB)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overwhelming ,-1,30,1-Nov-14,"Went for dinner one night on the recommendations of friends. It's outdoors and even at night is hot! You walk in and it is overwhelming there are so many food places!!! The second you sit down you are swamped with people giving you menus telling you to eat at their food stand which we didn't like, we wanted to walk around and browse before we chose but it was almost impossible with people heckling you!! The boys decided on Chilli crab, nasi goreng and chicken and rice which was amazing and not expensive compared to home! Chilli is put on everything so make sure you make it very clear if you don't want it, they won't remake a dish or give a refund! At least the whole coconuts with straws were a great respite from the heat. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the Seafood Scams,-1,10,26-Oct-14,"If you are not careful you will be ripped off here by unscrupulous seafood stall holders. The one who took us for a ride was from Stall 23, Takara Grilled Seafood.It works like this: - Friendly host escorts you to a table and brings out his colourful menu. Most of the prices on the menu are reasonable. - He strongly recommends the grilled prawns, listed at $8 per 100 grams, and suggests two each is about right. You agree because it is a marketplace and everything else looks reasonable. - The prawns come, they are OK. - As soon as you finish them, he comes and whisks the platter away. So no evidence!! - When the bill comes, your prawns cost about $20 each (i.e. 250 grams), and you have no way of disproving it.Unfortunately this is one of those episodes where the mistake we made was trusting a friendly local person."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Rip Off/ Below Average Food,-1,10,23-Oct-14,"Unfortunately what could be a very pleasant outdoor-eating experience is ruined by the vendors. Expect to be hassled by various touts and then to be ripped off by them or a stall holder. If you choose anything with a marked price it is generally ok - although prices are no cheaper than restaurants - it is NOT street food prices. But if you choose anything by weight you will be ripped off big time. Go anywhere for street food, such as Adam Road, which is quite nearby. For seafood, head to the East Coast Seafood Centre.But avoid Newton Circus. Amazed the government haven't dome more to clean up the brazen thieves that run this place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Rip off,-1,10,8-Oct-14,Don't eat here. Many years ago it was affordable and the food was reasonable but now it's a rip off. Last night we had a small chili crab and a plate of vegetarian noodles together with a bottle of water and a coconut juice and it came to $60 for street food. Especially stay away from the lady at stall 46. there are many other places in Singapore worth spending your money at.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average to below average food,-1,30,6-Oct-14,"The centre has a large variety of local cuisine - hawker food and seafood. However the food is slightly over priced compared with other hawker centres, and locals say the reason is due to tourists who frequent the place. We have tried a few different stalls and unfortunately, have not found any stall that provides really good-tasting food. Most food centres in the shopping malls provide better tasting food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tips for a great experience despite the daunting setup,-1,30,19-Sep-14,"Went to the Newton (circus) food hawker centre.Pro's: Great atmosphere, lots of stalls to choose from, great satays and noodles, reasonable pricesCon's: Many touters for seats infront of there stalls to infer to eat from them. Prices reasonable but not cheap. If new to this it can be daunting of which stall to choose and confronting with the touting and some being pushy.Recommendations: Less hectic seating on the perimter than inside the middle plus you get any breeze/air. Less touting on the perimter.Try to choose a stall with a hygiene symbol of AWe were lucky that we sat and got advice from a local family.Our best food choices were the malaysian satays from #22 best satay stall on an end of the inside perimeter."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Terrible, find another hawker centre",-1,10,13-Sep-14,"We went here with family and the atmosphere and the sellers where unfriendly and pushy.
We settled for pretty bad and overprised laksa and not good at all meatballs.
Satay and Beer where OK
This place have no soul..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Food ok , and not as cheap as you would expect",-1,30,5-Sep-14,"The food is ok and more expensive that you would think, due to the vicinity and the amounts of tourist. However the experience is still worthwhile if you enjoy experiencing something different. A different style of life in a different culture. I enjoy the outside environment and the smells floating around the air. However, if you don't like to sweat and eat at the same time then this is not for you."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Horrible atmosphere,-1,10,28-Aug-14,"Came back to Singapore after 20 years when I used to live across the street from Newton Circus. They have seriously destroyed everything that this hawker centre was. Not only is it unrecognizable, but the vendors are pushy. The atmosphere is stressful and uninviting. Go to Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown for a real hawker experience. Don't get trapped in to Newton Circus. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A 48 hour experience ,-1,20,6-Aug-14,"We visited newton circus as one of our colleagues wanted to see what had changed in 25 yrs. his last visit Was a buzzy , lively place and I thought the food was great , however three others had squid and suffered very badly the next day , I'd still go back as I had a great meal but disappointing three people were ill "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",worst hawker centre in Singapore,-1,10,12-Jul-14,"Really dislike this hawker center. One visit was enough for me, I won’t give it a second chance. There are so many amazingly wonderful hawker centers in Singapore, why anyone goes to Newton Circus is beyond my comprehension. You get accosted with pesky hagglers the second you arrive, the tables have warnings about not ordering from the individuals haggling you but to order directly at the stall instead. This sort of says it all. Newton Circus is a generally unpleasant place because of these people. Lau Pa Sat satay evenings has a slight bit of this same scene but they leave you alone after one attempt, and the overall vibe is enjoyable and hectic and manageable. At Newton Circus, there is nothing enjoyable at all about the persistent hecklers who are there, it feels like, to exploit the tourist element. As to the quality of the food, I can’t even comment because I couldn’t wait to leave. Thankfully I have tons of other fantastic choices for hawker food, I am not missing anything by opting out of this one."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",really for locals,-1,30,2-Jul-14," Very different to 15 years ago when it was relaxed and cheap food. This time it felt hustled. Rushed to a table and seemingly forced to order in a rush. The food was very expensive and average quality. We got poor value because we looked like tourists, which is a bad thing here now."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid Stall 46 Jian Ha Seafood BBQ - major rip off.,-1,20,6-Jun-14,"The hawker centre was busy on a wet Friday night and had limited 'free seating' as most tables were for diners of a certain stall. 46 said we could order from other places so that suited our group. We had no complaints about the food: string ray, chili crab, 4 prawns and fried rice. The menu indicated prices but we were not asked or advised to the reality. $8.00 per 100 g it said but they claimed $80 for 4 prawns- $20 a prawn!!! Served with plastic plates and forks. I'm sure they were not over 200 g per prawn. It's too hard when they have been eaten. We asked for a small serve of the sting ray but were charged for the large. We also asked for a small crab and that was $40. That didn't seem too bad but to hand over $60 per head for a meal on plastic plates, wet ground and tables seemed a real rip off. Tourists beware. Ask for proof and cost. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be Warned,-1,10,5-May-14,"2 years ago we were warned not to go to Newton Hawker Centre as it is a tourist trap. Previous years we had fantastic chilly crab. On the previous trip we could not go to the centre so we went this time. The chilly crab was a watered down tomato paste with a little chilly taste. The crab we chose was also not the same crab when it arrived. Previous years you got a receipt when you ordered your food and you paid straight away. Not this time. When we got the bill, they increased the amount. When we queried it, they got very aggressive. We refused to pay the amount. In the one corner of our table was a telephone no you phone if you feel done in. I started to phone that no and only then they started to change their attitude. We paid a lesser amount but still more than we were supposed to pay. BE WARNED and stay away. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the prawns!,-1,30,20-Apr-14,"My husband and I decided to go to Newtons Circus for local cheap food for dinner while in Singapore tonight. I had a $5 meal, and he decided to have the garlic prawns recommended by a nice little old lady saying ""hmm yum yum"". On presentation it looked fantastic. Looked more like lobster than prawns. Four of them. When it came to paying we thought she was saying $16 for prawns and fried rice. Turns out it was $16 for EACH prawn making a grand total of $64!!!!!!! Apparently they go by weight......so when ordering garlic prawns (yum yum), ask the price FIRST! Not the cheapest meal ever :/"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a miss if you are extra sensitive to strong smells,-1,30,13-Apr-14,"For vegetarians, it is a worst place to go. It smells like hell and I eat non-veg stuff pretty frequently, and still I couldn't stand the smells. The look and feel is of course, third world and not clean as per Singapore standards. If you want a cheap eat and can stand smells, go for it. Otherwise, skip it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good but overrated,-1,30,5-Apr-14,"There are so many stalls to choose from so you have to look around to make sure you pick the right one. After you order and pay, the food will be delivered to your table (you have to get a table first and note down the table no.) Food here is OK so-so but what you get is the variety and the experience of being in a hawker-centre environment. Plus it's cheap! Worth a visit."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What a taxi driver would recommend,-1,30,30-Mar-14,"9 out of 10 times when I hop on a taxi and ask the driver to bring me to a hawker centre, they would recommend Newton Circus. Later I found out why from my Singaporean friends - (i) for tourists, this place can't go too wrong - it is big, with different varieties of food; and (ii) the driver can always pick up someone from there. It's actually not bad, but the food is more expensive than other hawker centres, and especially for seafood, the menu has no fixed price and if you're not a local, you'll certainly be ripped off. There are a lot of local hawker centres. You just need to ask your Singaporean friends, not taxi drivers."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not a good place for hawker food,-1,20,17-Mar-14,"Same food everywhere, and not impressive. They are just not delicious. Good thing about Singapore hawker centres are they are very clean, but I dislike them using many non-recyclable materials, which in long term it is bad for the environment."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best fish head curry,-1,30,15-Feb-14,This was on my first day in Singapore - went there due to a recommendation and ordered the fish head curry because she never lets me down. Fabulous!!!!!The only downside was that when we went it was almost empty. Granted it was a Sunday around noon - I didn't think ahead about the time of day. It would have been nice to see it busy with all the venders open.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Overpriced, but maybe worth the experience",-1,30,24-Jan-14,"As others have said, the food is not particularly a good value, and we seem to have gotten mild food poisoning. This in a city where it is very hard to find bad food. However, the experience of haggling for food and then sitting outside while sharing long tables with locals and visitors alike might be to your liking. We found it an interesting experience but will not return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Severe food poisoning from chilli crab,-1,10,14-Jan-14,"We got into Singapore from Australia as a stop over on the way to London and decided to sample the 'must-do' things in Singapore on our short visit. We had heard that sampling the chilli crab from one of the bigger hawker centres is well worth it, so we asked our concierge which is the best place, and were advised to try Newton, as another popular centre is undergoing refurbishment.We arrived and were pleasantly surprised that the ""aggressive selling"" that we had been warned about was not the case - apparently there has been a crackdown on this. People will encourage you, gently, to read their menu, but to be honest, I was expecting and almost disappointed to not have to engage in friendly banter and got the feeling the stall owners were holding back due to the new rules.We walked around for 20 minutes and eventually selected a stall, spoke with the owner and ordered the crab. It was ok (we have high standards), and we finished it, paid and left feeling happy. The middle of the night saw an end to that! I have never been so ill, and my wife was almost as bad. I won't bore you with the gory details but needless to say we were violently ill for 2 days with acute gastroenteritis, and almost unable to get our flight to London. We saw a doctor and I was close to being admitted to hospital due to dangerous dehydration (what a nightmare that would have been!).In short, be very careful before deciding to eat here. It's worth seeing one of the markets, but maybe better to get a sealed, commercially produced drink from one of the vendors rather than risk what we went through - it was just awful and ruined our trip to Singapore, as we spent the entire time running between bed and bathroom.As an aside, we stayed in the Mandarin Oriental, who could not have been better. Apart from it being a stunning hotel, the staff went out of their way to assist us during our illness, and gave us a late checkout of 8pm on the day of departure so we could go straight from bed to the airport. I look forward to going back to Singapore, and staying in the Mandarin Oriental again, but will most likely give the hawker centres a miss next time!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Some great stalls, if they were open.",-1,30,6-Jan-14,"We visited Newton Hawker Centre around 2.30pm on afternoon for a late-ish lunch. We arrived in the pouring rain to unfortunately find about 60% of the 'stalls' closed for business. We did however manage to find some hianese chicken as well as some fresh indian food, both which were very tasty and resonably priced. In saying this, prices were no substanically cheaper than some seemingly more 'upmakret' offerings in ION Orchard etc, however we understand the food at Newton was probably more authentic and more true to the Hawker experience.Was the food good? Yes. Was the value and atmosphere amazing? Not really. Would it have been better if all the stores were open? For sure.Would drop back in if passing by but would definately check out some other Hawker Centres first."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive ,-1,30,30-Dec-13,"Newton hawker centre is definitely worth a look, & the food was good without being exceptional, we had stingray, 2 king prawns, sweet & sour chicken, 9 chicken wings, seafood fried rice & 4 tiger beers.Total cost $160.00, & that was after arguing with the vender & getting a $10 discount. We won't be back @ those prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but was looking for more,-1,30,16-Oct-13,The food was good but not great. I liked the chili crab but Im sure I could have had a better version of it somewhere else. Its really hard to know exactly which stall will have the best food. The Chicken Rice I had was not good at all. We had better food at the satay stands close to Lau Pa Sat (closed for 2 more months apparently). I liked Makansutra better to be honest.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too tourist focus,-1,20,10-Oct-13,"I wish the hawkers focus on the quality and taste of their products. It not exactly sheep to eat here, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired. V disappointed, especially to some brought up in Malaysia and Melbourne"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad place with a standard food,-1,20,1-Oct-13,"The food seller is pretty aggressive and annoying, not like any other hawker center.
The food price is a bot high, maybe it is because there're too many advertising promoting this place, so they tend to put higher price for their food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to try out local fare,-1,30,31-Aug-13,Good place to try out local fare if you stay near orchard. . The fish soup near to the Carpark is great. The rest you can get around the same standard at a cheaper price elsewhere. Be careful of ordering seafood. Got some experiences of rip off by the hawkers there. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid! Avoid!,-1,10,20-Jul-13,Everyone will tell you that this is a FAMOUS place to eat local food in Singapore. I've lived here 13 years and the place always gives me the creeps and makes me feel cheated by the aggressive hawkers selling their expensive seafood. The only time I ever go there is if I'm stuck in the neighborhood at lunch time and have no other option. If anyone were to invite me to a group party there in the future...I'd pass.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Dodgy Seafood hawkers,-1,30,13-Jul-13,Seafood very fresh but be careful that you get what you pay for. Some hawkers will try to sell you over priced seafood so make sure they weigh it in front of your eyes as you pay per 100 gramms.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worst hawker centre in Singapore ...,-1,10,16-Jun-13,Rude and pushy vendors ...late night fights and very very pricy...they only want to sell large BBQ overpriced prawns ....AVOID !!!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A nice spot for hawker,-1,30,29-May-13,"The food here is not bad, there are many choices around but it seems to be centred towards seafood. Be warned though, the seafood stall people will definitely pester you to order from their stalls. Be firm."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but very touristic,-1,30,21-May-13,"The food here is nice, but for a Hawker Centre it is overpriced as they know many tourists come here. You can also find better food at a cheaper price in other Hawkers."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Tourist Trap,-1,30,14-May-13,"There are almost 100 diffent talls all selling much the same food. I was told that this was cheaper and a lot more local Singaporeans ran this up until a few years ago. The food is still good but beware of the prices. Ask price before you order or you will get ripped off. Our meal for three with prawns, BBQ Stingray and Chilli Crab was $128.00"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Overrated- Overpriced, pushy staff that rip you off",-1,10,5-May-13,"If you want a hawker experience go somewhere else- La Pau Sat, Chinatown, Tiong Bahru but not Newton. You get pushed into buying very overpriced food, it's not a normal hawker experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food,-1,30,25-Apr-13,"Like:Close to orchard Scotts
Disliked: too many approach from staff to buy food in certain stall.
Too crowded in some nights."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Becoming expensive overpriced & portions reducing in size !,-1,30,24-Apr-13,Used to be very good and cheap a few years back I don't mind the touting after all it's an open air hawker food centre and that's what you will get ! Definitely over priced for such small portions and the old Newton circus hawker center many years ago was much better but I must say the food is still delicious . Better find somewhere more affordable next time.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over priced and too harassing, better hawker centres nearly everywhere else",-1,20,21-Apr-13,"We were warned about the inflated prices, but were still happy to try the experience . Very disappointing, the food was average and not as good or at least no better than food we had eaten at other hawker centres, including those within shopping malls. The harassment from vendors was relentless and made it hard to browse the food stalls. The prices were much too high for the size & quality of the food we had, definitely would not go back or recommend"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre,-1,30,7-Apr-13,"1) The ambience does not seem the same , after the renovation
2)Some stalls still over-charging.
3)Choices of stalls variety seem to be down"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","overpriced, crowded, too much hussle and hassle",-1,20,6-Apr-13,"we went for a quick family dinner and having lived in Singapore for many years we feel quite ""local"", but here we were treated like fresh off the airplane foreigners and the prices quoted for fish and seafood were way beyond what market price is elsewhere. Vist for the experience but take care!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Mixed skills and different quality local food,-1,30,3-Apr-13,It used to be one of the best places to eat at in Singapore and my family often frequent there but much has changed. Not every stall that you go to serve you good local food. You've to be wiser and more selective now. I recall the Thai food stall there is one of the best. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nice seafood, a little more expensive than other food centres.",-1,30,19-Mar-13,"The seafood here is mostly good, but you will pay more here than you would at another food centre as many tourist are brought here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Many visitors come for local foods,-1,30,18-Mar-13,"Many staffs, different kind of foods, near ochard area , expensive and mainly for tourist! Different staffs with different standards. You must ask how much the price especially for sea food stalls. Some times cost a lot because the charge by weight , like fish , prawn , crab and etc.If the stall is long queue , normally , the food is nice!So, open your eye to observe, your nose to smell,.. and may ask your friends! Enoyed your food !!!! Good luck :-} Sun"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth a visit,-1,30,16-Mar-13,"Regarded as a tourist venue with 'expensive' hawker food, for most visitors it will be more than a worthwhile visit and not deemed expensive. It has certainly become more ' established' than when last there some twenty two years ago.There are plenty of other hawker venues that are more authentic and cheaper...but was happy to go with friends who had never been."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,-1,30,15-Mar-13,"After many years of eating at Newton circus, we just don't anymore. It has become far too expensive. It is a shame that it has become so commercial and expensive. We might try again soon, but at this stage it is not going to be for quite some time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Realtively recently-renovated hawker centres,-1,30,14-Mar-13,"The hawker centre at Newton Circus badly needed and received a renovation. It it well-known by the tourist crowd. It is not heavily frequented by the locals, as there are much better hawker centres around the island."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Average food at best,-1,20,14-Mar-13,"The fact that I lived a 10-minute walk away from this establishment but only visited the place 5 times in 6 years tells you all you need to know. Let's start with the good. It's spacious, ventilated, clean, you're spoilt for choice and there's a nice buzz about the place. Now for the not-so-good. If you're a food snob, there are other tastier places to go to for local food - way better. Secondly, the harrassment you receive from the hawker stall assistants can be frustrating. There are strict rules about touting at Newton and i tend to look the at my options from afar so as to not be pressured into making a decision. Next the price. Be aware, that Newton is a pricey neighbourhood just a stone's throw from Orchard Road. As such stall rentals are expensive and need to be covered. So expect to pay more for your food. Watch out for the seafood prices. Most locals won't go to Newton for the seafood so I would advice that you double check the price for prawns/crabs etc before placing your order. Lastly taxis can be a challenge to find when you're done eating/drinking so do be prepared to take the train/bus."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really a Tourist Trap,-1,20,14-Mar-13,"Good food stalls wouldn't park themselves here. Everyone here is out to make a big buck from innocent tourists. They had a renovation few years ago to spruce their image, but in the process much of the good food has run away from the obscene rentals. Only came here with a foreign friend who insisted on trying. He became receptive to my recommendations at other places after that meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Touristy, but probably worth it for the experience",-1,30,28-Feb-13,"I am old enough to remember the good old days in Singapore when mobile food stalls were wheeled into places at night and set up in a hive of activity to provide a range of good quality, cheap and delicious varieties of dishes that you could watch being cooked, and virtually without tourists so you got the real deal at rock bottom prices. The one at the Cold Store Car Park off Orchard Road was my favourite (if anybody can remember that far back!). Alas such itinerant food stalls no longer exist, all being now confined (on the grounds of hygiene) to a permanent stalls at fixed locations such as the Newton Hawker Centre– this being one of the largest. Oh well, all good things change over time, but I have to say that it is not as good as the old transient stalls.Having said that it is an interesting experience for the uninitiated, although it has become too touristy and not as good as some other, less tourist-orientated food centres – much better food can be had in Chinatown. Nevertheless, if you want to go for the experience then there are some good dishes to be found, although they do vary. My advice would be to walk around firstly to decide what you want, ignoring the blandishments of the stall owners who try to entice you to sit at their table. Probably 75-80% offer the same things, but some offer different or specialist dishes. Also, remember you don’t have to eat everything from the same stall, as if you fancy something from another stall then order it and they will bring it to you – but do ensure you make it clear to them where you are sitting (and best not to pick something from too far away, although if you don’t pay for it until it’s delivered they will find you!). If you want to eat all dishes at the same time, then ensure you get the timing of your order right if ordering from different stalls (order from the furthest stall first)It’s also worth noting that the Newton Centre is not particularly convenient for walking or public transport, and although taxis are cheap and easy to find to take you there early on, they are not so easy to get to go home later in the evening as most that turn up have been pre-booked. It is possible to flag one down on the adjacent main road, but you may have to wait a while before a free one passes, so you might consider ordering a taxi in advance to take you home and avoid much frustrating waving at taxis when all you want is to return to your hotel room!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","overpriced, overhyped - living off vulnerable and less aware visitors",-1,20,25-Feb-13,"i visited this brothel of an eatery several times in years gone by and vowed i would not return. however i did, with three friends who were visiting singapore and insisted they must visit newton circus. alas nothing has changed except the prices - now more ludicrous than ever - definition of 'market price' is the maximum that the food seller feels he can rip the customer off without provoking violence (at which point local 'helpers' insist you pay your bill). food was average, service aggressive, and prices high. as many posters have said, there are many less expensive and, frankly, better hawker centers - try maxwell road, the food street in chinatown, farrer road, or even go out to changi village."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced tourist trap,-1,20,19-Feb-13,"Newton Hawker centre is an overpriced tourist trap, particularly the stalls selling seafood. You can get food of the same or better quality at lower prices at any of the hawker centers in Singapore. The stalls on the edge, away from where the tourists normally go are much better value. If you want the atmosphere, and the seafood than Long Beach at Dempsey is better (although it is also a bit of a tourist trap) whereas if you want the Hawker experience than Lau Pa Sat has a wider variety at proper prices"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey,-1,30,3-Feb-13,Worth the try but a bit pricey compare to other locals hawker centre. Good to go there once for the experience.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,-1,10,1-Feb-13,"Most of the food here is over-rated, though I find the Muslim food pretty good. If you are in thsi area, why not try the Adam Rd Food Centre, which has better choice of local food but with better prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Largely tourists,-1,30,20-Jan-13,Mainly an evening night experience for tourists ... there are better places ...... Beware of seafood prices check beforehand
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore Experience,-1,30,18-Jan-13,"Going to a hawker centre like this can be a daunting exprience, knowing you will be attacked by people trying to get you to sit and order food with them, but a trip to Singapore should include a visit to this for the experience. The food also is usually excellent - and unless one orders something very special, one can have a delicious meal and be very surprised at how little they paid at the end of the meal. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Same ol' food, twice the price",-1,20,17-Jan-13,Newton hawker centre and Boat Quay must have shared the same founder. Head down to East Coast hawker for a better deal and better view.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice local foodfare,-1,30,15-Jan-13,"NIce spread of local food, but for foreigners, please beware of the cheaters there, who tend to hike up their charges when they sense tourist presence. Make sure you ask the price before ordering!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not impressed,-1,20,8-Jan-13,"Nothing much. Despite the recommendations to go there for the food, I do not get the attraction simple because for that price and the kind of food, I can get it at other hawker centres at better price and similar taste"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","So this is, the famous Newton Hawker Centre",-1,30,7-Jan-13,"...and we lived in Singapore so long and everybody is talking about it, so we went. Well...ok.....by far not the as good and cost effective and nice as others. ...and we heard that real Singaporeans would not go there either. May be good for tourists?"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Travelled for 40 min to get here and a little dissapointed,-1,30,4-Jan-13,"Didnt like the way they all jump on you to eat at there stall, no other Centres do this and I think they chase tourist away with this pushy attitude, not nice for ladies to be jumped upon like this, food experience was not as good as other Centres"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,-1,30,2-Jan-13,"Std Hawer food, will not travel there as a Singaporean. There are other places with similar food, better taste and more reasonable price"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Busy Hawker Centre, be early! (for both parking and seating)",-1,30,31-Dec-12,One of the many outstanding Hawker centres that Singapore has. A nice way of getting to know Singaporean and in general Asean food. This place is very popular so you have to be early and taking a taxi is preferred.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go before 6pm,-1,30,27-Dec-12,"We arrived approximately 1500 to find only about 10% of the store were open for business, luckily we found michaels little shop who provided us sting ray, calamari, prawns and chili mud crab. All of the above we're cooked we'll and tasted fantastic, with bags of flavour. Value was not fantastic but service was very helpful.Not a bad place to visit, just come in the evening when every thing is open "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Marketed to tourists,-1,30,5-Dec-12,Certain stalls are good but the place is a tourist attraction so prices are overall more expensive than other hawker centres.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to visit,-1,30,2-Dec-12,"Newton circus used to be the go-to place for Singaporean suppers, but there are so many other options available now![Alfresco/Outdoors]1. Chomp Chomp Food Centre (at Serangoon Gardens) Accessible by public transport, but any self-respecting taxi driver will be able to bring you there. Small, only open from 6pm. It has the best BBQ stingray in town. 2. East Coast Lagoon Food CentreAt the end of east coast. Great place if you were planning to visit East Coast Park.3. Glutton's BayStarted by a famous food critic, , he brought together the best of Singapore tastes in one convenient spott (beside the Esplanade). Also opens till late, this is my favourite supper spot after catching a show at the Esplanade or Marina Bay Sands theatre. 4. Food Republic Beer GardenIn the footsteps of Glutton's Bay, this newly opened makan place is right beside St James Power Station, which is a great stop after a day at Sentosa. [Air-conditioned]All-time favourite: Food Republic at Wisma Atria. It has all the yummy local food like fried Hokkein mee and carrot cake. The more expensive sister brand is Food Opera, B4 of Ion Orchard."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",average food at high prices,-1,20,27-Nov-12,There are only a couple of stalls at the Newton Hawker centre that I would patronize....the Malay rice stall ( Nasi Padang ) and the Duck Noodle stall. All the other stalls are over priced and not that great in terms of food quality.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive food!,-1,10,18-Nov-12,The food is expensive and not even that good by local standards. Tourist trap! Please avoid going to this place if possible. Hawker food in singapore is really much cheaper and better tasting at other places. One of the main draws of this place might be that it is open till late at night. But there are other alternatives available.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap,-1,10,17-Nov-12,"So many much better places to eat local food without the rudeness of the vendors,overpricing and often poor food quality.............Singapore hawker food can be brilliant but generally not here.This is where you go if you are using an outdated guidebook. Try Lau Pa Sat instead."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore's worst kept secret.,-1,10,17-Nov-12,Touting is prohibited but there are many ways you could be harass. The most expense outdoor food centre in the city. The Tourist Promotion is the biggest culprit. They should not call this lemon an apple.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's good but more expensive,-1,30,6-Nov-12,"I go there all the time because it's close to where I stay. The food there are nice, such as chicken rice, Hokkien noodles, satay, and seafood. But since the seafood price don't show on menu, they charge tourists more. Make sure you compare the price before you order!!!! I am serious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Harassed by dishonest vendors,-1,10,31-Oct-12,"This is a disgusting place to eat due to heat, humidity, poor hygiene and dishonesty.Store vendor # 49 pestered us to eat there and after circulating the food court once and being hounded by store vendors with what is essentially the same menu, we settled down at #49. Instantly the affiliated drink vendor requested that we order from him and so two coconut juices were bought for S$6. The crab was supposedly 900 grams and was quite tasty in Singaporean chilli sauce. When asked how much in total, the owner suddenly could not converse in English. The next dish two tiger prawns in garlic sauce were dry and bland. We dipped it in the sauce of the crab dish. The oily fried rice was equally bland and also had to be drenched in chilli sauce.Whilst dining, owner of #49 calculated on a napkin and when the bill for S$100 arrived we requested for a receipt. The receipt arrived five minutes later with the description “seafood dinner”. We asked for some descriptions and five minutes later abbreviations and prices were made available on the receipt. We took photographs of the complaints number to call but never managed to call. Would it have made any difference? Surely we were not the first customers to be cheated. After all that chilli we had some crushed ice desserts which was cooling and escaped the place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,-1,10,29-Oct-12,"From the moment you arrive you are pestered by store owners desperate for you to try their chilli crab or swordfish. Each store holder will try to convince you that the tables near their store are theirs (which obviously they aren't) and force you to sit with one of their menus.The food is overpriced and available much more cheaply elsewhere. It's quality is dubious and generally much lower than what you will find a Food Repulic or Kopitan in a shopping centre.I believe the problem with Newton Circus is that green tourists staying in Orchard Road hear about it and head there where they are easily manipulated into paying through the nose for second rate food.My advice: get on the MRT to Raffles Place and head to Lau Pa Sat Pavillion. Cheaper, better and far more authentic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",disappointing,-1,20,20-Oct-12,Be very careful when ordering seafood of any kind as they price it by weight per 100 Grams. This can turn out very expensive if you do not insist on the cost beforehand. We have not been back since we took friends over 2 years ago. One the up side the FRESH juice outlets are excellent value.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre - Just okay tourist trap,-1,30,15-Oct-12,We bring guests there when they come if it is a short visit - lots to eat in one location. But the stall hawkers can be really aggressive (for one who lives there) and the prices astonishing. Plus all of the high school aged kids drinking while still in school uniforms is off-putting
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive for a hawker center,-1,10,18-Sep-12,Overly priced just because it is a famous tourist spot. Total rip off for very very average food. Most hawker centers in singapore have better food and way cheaper.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overated,-1,30,17-Sep-12,"Food there is pricey compared to other hawker centres, very tourist type of place....

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,-1,30,31-Aug-12,Hawker Food and price for tourists and foreigners and visitors to Singapore. Much better at other Hawker Centers.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food but nothing to shout about,-1,30,26-Aug-12,"This place was great 15 years ago but today, it is just another hawker centre. With so many newer food courts in town and in almost all shopping malls, Newton Hawker Centre has lost its appeal. Today it is spacious and fairly clean, with lots of seating and parking available. But I agree with the other reviewers that there is not a lot of choice as every hawker seems to be offering the same dishes. If you're in the area and need a meal, by all means visit Newton Hawker Centre. But it is not worth going out of your way to have a meal there. Just make sure you check on the price of the dish you want to order first to avoid problems later on."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nothing special,-1,30,20-Aug-12,"Went to this food centre yesterday for dinner. spacious open space, not so smoky but once you stepped in the area, there will be a few people help you to look for empty tables and they'll bug you after that with their food menu. It's good for their service but frankly speaking i don't like to be forced to order their food because of that. Food was okay, could say that every stall cooks same types of food, a bit pricy. Overall, it's just another food hunting spot for tourists? "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive hawker fare,-1,20,16-Aug-12,it is generally a rip off place and prices are beyond almost any other hawker centres in Singapore. Gives tourists a bad impression of Singapore.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,-1,20,26-Jul-12,"The closest hawker centre to the tourist belt but expensive and the food is not as good as elsewhere. If you really want to try better food, Go to Lau Pa Sat. A cab ride is cheap compared to other big cities. Of if you're really adventurous, then a true blue hawker centre like Tiong Bahru market is a good bet."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",No variety.,-1,10,23-Jul-12,Selling similar food at almost 3/4 of all stalls. Ripped off and average quality food even local don't patronise!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too expensive for normal food.,-1,10,19-Jul-12,Im in a F & B business. The food that Newton Hawker offer are too much expensive and food are just so-so. I can find better food all around Singapore at a cheaper rate.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food choices keep repeating,-1,20,3-Jul-12,"I don't know if it's the management who accept the tenders from food stalls or coincidence, it appears the food and drink selection keep repeating themselves after every 5-6 stalls. There are several stalls offering similar dishes (eg, grilled seafood, fried kway teow/ noodles and even packed drinks). I stopped coming here ever sine my last visit due to the lack of food choices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","""Nice local hawker food with questionable prices for mere hawker food""",-1,30,22-Jun-12,"Newton Hawker Centre is a must place for any type of visitor from anywhere in the world when visiting Singapore. A good range of local foods to choose from to truly enjoy what Singapore is all about when it comes to real tasty food. For sea food lovers, be weary when you order the sea creatures for your meal as the hawkers running such stalls will rip you apart when it comes to paying for such a meal. Still, this is the place to enjoy a great meal and lots of beer. Fantastic surroundings with lots of people from different walks of life every other night, makes this a great place to unwind. Go for it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over-rated,over-priced",-1,20,20-Jun-12,Locals would generally eat somewhere else. Rowdy drinking crowds late at night. Watch out for over-priced seafood stalls.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,-1,20,25-May-12,"Iconic hawker centre, but most certainly a tourist place. A few good stalls but dominated by seafood BBQ stalls that charges exhorbitant prices! Go there for the atmosphere, and stick to non-expensive food like satays, oyster omelettes, fried hokkien noodles etc."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very annoying,-1,10,24-May-12,"You have people asking you to eat at their stand while walking around looking at menus, very annoying when you try have a nice diner without being pushing around. That's unfortunate this centre used to be a good one. People told me that the high rents that stand owners pay make them ""agressive"" toward getting customers... The food quality has also decreased the last 3 years. Avoid this tourist trap."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated,-1,10,12-May-12,"The food there is good, however, prices over there are way above the usual prices. Try other local hawker centres such as ""Chomp Chomp"" at Serangoon Gardens, Adam Road Food Centre or Tiong Bahru Food Centre.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too pricy,-1,10,8-May-12,The place only interested in tourist. Avoid those hawkers selling BBQ seafood.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,-1,30,6-May-12,"Newton Hawker Centre may be worth visiting as a tourist, if you want to see what hawker centres are like, but as someone living in the city, I feel it is over-rated and very expensive. I avoid visiting it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker experience: things you should know!,-1,30,3-May-12,"After the cab dropped us off at the center we were a bit overwhelmed by the activity. Here are some tips that I wish I had known 1. Be ready to be approached by all vendors particularly the high margin seafood vendors2. Take your time, walk around and find a seat near a stall that appeals to you. They will bring the food to your dedicated table.3. keep in mind that the seating area is a public space, and not owned by the seafood guys who will thrust a menu in your face. If you want satays, sugar cane juice and beers only, then no problem; no obligation to order from them.4. If you want the seafood which is indeed fresh, be sure to inspect it checking for size of claws and have it weighted. I was missing a gigantic claw, they just shrugged and walked away.5 . Aside from the missing claw, we had lots of fun and enjoyed this experience.Next time I will try Maxwell hawker center for greater authenticity and less wheeling dealing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Never again,-1,10,2-May-12,Lots of touts with overpriced items. Good for tourists though but not for the natives since quality of food is just passable. Nothing great.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad choice of plce to savour local Singapore food,-1,20,30-Apr-12,Touristy and expensive. Stalls basically sells the same things.

I ate a bowl of Bee Hoon soup at Stanley Market in Hong Kong for HK$16=Sing$2.80. I couldn't believe the price, I ordered another bowl of bee hoon soup.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not a good choice,-1,10,12-Apr-12,"Newton Hawker Centre was built up to be a place to go ans sample great food and great prices; I found neither! It was dirty, smelly and not great value. Visit at your own peril"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touts are still bad news,-1,20,27-Mar-12,"We are locals so we were careful not to be fleeced. But the American guy sitting at the next table was not so lucky. We overheard him questioning the stall helper about his $72 bill for five prawns. Granted, these were big prawns, but $72??? The food is nothing to shout about either. Go only when you're in the vicinity and hungry. Definitely not worth going out of your way to visit this. Lots of better, cheaper and more authentic hawker food in many other places in Singapore. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker Gone Wrong,-1,10,22-Mar-12,"Where is the Newton Circus Hawker Center of yore? Where a bowl of the best Indian Mee Goreng was $1.80? A plate of over fried anything starts at SGD$ 22 for a small plate, and by local standards, that's more than extortion. It's so sad that that whole area has been gutted out and re-fitted - the old one epitomised what Singapore food fare had to offer and in its own unique setting. Sadly, that's all gone now and I hear the beautiful back and whites are also headed for the demolition derby. I bid a tearful adieu to an area that all Singaporeans have great memories of."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for Seafood!,-1,30,21-Mar-12,"As a local, this is a great place to come for seafood and a beer. It has a busy and noisy ambience, making it great for people spotting. However, the stall owners and touts can very pushy and bothersome, despite attempts to prevent such actions. The 1/2 dozen entrances/exits are also permanently 'manned' by smokers meaning you can't get in or out without a lung full of second hand smoke."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",They are killing Singapore's reputation,-1,10,17-Mar-12,"Touting, price discrimination and rude service..... Is this place for real? I mean... if you just want a quick meal and get out, no problem there. BUT, if you want to enjoy an evening having some of our beloved local food, this is the wrong place to head to. Avoid this place if you are a tourist and want to have some decent seafood at a fair price. They are just 'sharpening their knives' and waiting to rip you off the moment you get there!!! And if you are a local.... what are you doing there? At least thats what i am thinking after my last outing there!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the Most Famous Food Courts in Singapore,-1,30,17-Mar-12,"There are good hawker stands here, but not all are up to the same standard. Watch where the locals are lining up for a hint on which spots are the best."

However, when I went with my mom to a particular Malay stall in December 2011, my mom complained that we waited the food for over 10 to 15 minutes, but the lady boss just told my mom to be patient. After that remark, my mom and I never go back to that stall again."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go to Newton Hawker Centre,-1,10,28-Feb-12,Place dirty. Food overpriced. BBQ food stall pulling customers and eyeing everyone that walks in esp. tourists. Does not create a good feeling. You just want to finish quickly and get out.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey.,-1,20,13-Feb-12,"Prices and services are tourist orientated. Most locals avoid here since you can get the same at other hawkers at half the price.
Not recommended unless you stay across the street and do not have time to explore other options."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Revamped and better now...,-1,30,9-Feb-12,"Years ago I would give only 1 star to this Food Centre. It does not get by with good food. Prices are not exactly cheap too. But it is a one-stop to taste the local delicacies without having to travel to too many places. Having itself near Orchard Road, I suppose the little price increment is a premium the tourists have to pay. For me, I'd only go in the middle of the night if I am in the vicinity and too lazy to think of where to get a bite."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eeeks!,-1,20,7-Feb-12,"This place is known for being bad service, overrated, dishonest. I've eaten there once when I was young, but have heard lotsa horror stories from friends, relatives, and the media. Go to other places... u can find better food at better prices!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to eat than at Newton,-1,30,27-Jan-12,Newton Hawker center is centrally located with many stalls. Many of the food sold are not that bad but not excellent either. Because tourist do not know of other places to eat - they tend to go to Newton to eat - and pay very high price for the food. In Singapore there are a lot of places to eat - including those food courts in shopping malls and coffee shops. Tourist - I urge you to ask any people in the streets or at your hotel where ELSE you can go to have some local food... and you should be able to find one within 1 to 2 km....
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Used to be a great place, but alas, no longer",-1,20,24-Jan-12,"Pushy stall owners, only ok food, and ridiculous prices! Not a place I'd be recommending. Waited more than 25 minutes for our food, then went back to the stall to realise they had lost the order. And when the food arrived, it wasn't anything to write home about."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",you can always find better!,-1,20,23-Jan-12,This place is definitely over-rated. Food quality is not fantastic and price is definitely a no-no!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful when ordering,-1,30,21-Jan-12,"This is a hawker centre which tourist have become attracted to. Be aware that many of the items on the menu's are sold by their weight, which may not always be obvious. That said most of the food sold, (mainly seafood) is of good quality and flavour.Can be reached by MRT to Newton Circus just one stop from Orchard Road. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,-1,10,20-Jan-12,"This is very close to home, but we actually try and suggest to friends not to go there. They are expensive, the Hawkers is not as good as the many others around town - this is an example where they have gained a good reputation through word of mouth or travel books and they don't deserve. If you do decide to go, make sure they don't rip you off on price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The old magic isn't there,-1,20,20-Jan-12,"Since it was renovated, most of the shops aren't there anymore and it's hot and it seems like there are just those seafood shops.

So have not been back in almost a year!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","It’s a tourist attraction, not a foodie hawker center",-1,30,20-Jan-12,"As a native, I wouldn’t say this is the best hawker center around. There are only a handful of good food stalls there but most are average. What makes this hawker center unattractive is the prices. Because it’s a “tourist” attraction, you get higher prices; basically it’s a tourist trap. Don’t be pressure by the touting hawkers. Find a seat and take your time to decide on what you feel like having."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,-1,20,19-Jan-12,"If you are a tourist looking for a 'real' hawker centre experience do not go here. The food prices are highly inflated, the touts will drive you crazy and there are other touts who want to sell you sunglasses, watches etc. For a real experience, go to Lau Pa Sat in the financial district, If you are going to lunch you need to get there by 11:45 as the tables fill very quickly. Leave someone at your table to 'mind' it or place packets of disposable tissues at everyone's seats or you may come back to find others sitting in your seats. If you see an 'empty' table with packets of tissues on it, this means that the table has been taken."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worst hawker centre in Singapore,-1,10,18-Jan-12,"This place is a tourist rip-off, there have been several incidents of people being charged hundreds of dollars for hawker food. Examples may be found in Tripadvisor reviews, as well as a search of past news stories. If you are cheated, you should file an official complaint with the Singapore Tourism Board, they have successfully taken one of the stalls at Newton to court before on behalf of a tourist who was cheated.If you want a good Hawker Centre experience try Chomp Chomp, Lau Pa Sat, Maxwell Road Food Centre, East Coast Park Food Centre, or just about any other hawker centre in Singapore for a more authentic experience and better food. Ask Singaporeans for recommendations, just about anyone will be willing to share their advice on this topic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware the touts!,-1,30,17-Jan-12,"It's quite touristy and the prices reflect it. It's more expensive than going to Lau Pa Sat or a smaller local place, but the food is good. Always cheaper than a proper restaurant, just prepare to get hassled by the stalls as you walk past. The best bet is to just walk around the whole place and look at each stall to see what you want to get - don't let the hawkers get too pushy - if you tell them no then they should leave you alone. Check prices before you order - especially things like crab which are done by weight. Confirm what size you'll be charged for."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",bad,-1,10,7-Jan-12,"overpriced, too much touting and not much good food. it servers more like a tourist destination than a place for locals. i would definitely not recommend this to anyone. the only stall i wouldn't mind having is the XO ba chor mee, but i wouldn't take the effort to go there just to have that."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Centrally located hawker center with pricey tags.,-1,20,2-Jan-12,Newton has a good variety of local delights that comes with higher-than usual price tags. You wouldn't see much local Singaporeans at this hawker center.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food but $$,-1,30,28-Dec-11,"Favour of tourist where you can try all sorts of local food, but over priced and know to charge tourist prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A little overrated?,-1,30,23-Dec-11,"I know this is one of “the” Hawker Centre’s in Singapore and, to be honest, I did use to really enjoy this place. It all depends on your expectations. It’s in a good location, and does serve pretty good local foods. A nice introduction to the Singapore Hawker experience.For tourists, it’s definitely one of the nicer looking centres in Singapore… leafy, open, green and secluded from the traffic. Plus the stone floor is attractive and, of course, very clean. But, the downside is that the choices are very limited. And, depending on your expectations, a little expensive.Most of the stalls specialize in seafood. I don’t particularly like seafood, which leaves with me one or two BBQ meat stalls. These are fine (and actually much cheaper than seafood), but you can get BBQ meats in almost every street corner in Singapore!So, like I said… it depends on your expectations. I still recommend this place to tourists, but don’t come here so much myself anymore.Tips: be forceful with the touts… if you really don’t want what they are offering (i.e. their table, their drinks, their food, their napkins etc…) just tell them. And please take a look at the signs giving advice on the pricing… those visual signs do a much better job of describing the correct “haggling process” than I could!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton,-1,30,23-Dec-11,Not delicious as before. food are generally overpriced.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ask the price before you order!,-1,30,22-Nov-11,"We went to Newton on recommendation of the taxi driver- it looked a fun place to go, as it was, very evocative of the amosphere of Singapore. There were many ""trawlers"" trying to lure you to their tables- we were seduced by giant barbecued garlic prawns and chilli crab- which were delicious and we enjoyed- until we recieved the bill! 144Sin$ for a meal for two with plastic plates and knives and forks. Left feeling somewhat taken for a ride. The Singaporeans have heard that this place is expensive, the system seems to be go round to the stalls and pay as you go, do not accept what is brought to you and then pay later!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker centre to avoid if you can,-1,10,15-Sep-11,"This place is more for tourists and locals will avoid if they could. Foods are so-so and pricey. You have other better hawker centres elsewhere than this, where foods much tasty, better and cheaper.Hawkers here when they see locals walking in, they do not bother, knowing that they cannot ripped them off unlike tourists. So tourists be warned.If you wanted to try local foods, there are many hawker centres around the island, that sell the same things what Newton centre offered. You do not need to come here to try.Chances of tourists getting ripped off here is high, which has been proven on newspaper."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated and annoying touts,-1,20,16-Aug-11,"With so many great places to eat in Singapore, Newton Hawker Centre should be avoided. Lots of pressure to buy overpriced items, particularly seafood. There are many other places in Singapore where you get better food, at better prices, in a more pleasant atmosphere."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,-1,30,7-Jul-11,"Having grown up in Malaysia and being a keen cook, I like to think that my palate is quite educated in terms of Malaysian/Singaporean cuisine. We went to Newton Hawker Centre on the recommendation of a hotel staff member. From the start, you feel pressured by the touting. As you arrive, scouts from the various seafood stalls will spot you as tourists and notice your helplessness as you look around for an empty table. Having found you one, they push their menu onto you and, being a pushover, I feel obliged to order something from them. We had an oyster omelette (good), satay (tiny skewers, chewy beef), BBQ skate (tasty but greasy), fried rice and koay teow (both tasteless and rather devoid of protein or vegetable matter). I do concede that we might not have sampled food from the best stalls and that I may be making sweeping generalisations, however, even the food we had from the Kopitiam food court in Vivo City was much better in both taste and variety, and also cheaper. The other thing that detracts is that you have to use flimsy plastic cutlery that gets caught by the strong gusts from the strong oscillating fans, often showering you in food. Also, we were told that there wouldn't be a problem getting back to the hotel as there is a taxi stand there, but this is not the case. Most of the cabs that were dropping off passengers seemed to be enroute to some pre-booked destination. It took us 45 minutes to finally hail down some cabs that hadn't been pre-booked. All in all, an over-rated and disappointing experience. The night after that, we went to Chinatown and had a fantastic meal, both in taste and value. Note that this is in the food court (level 2 of the market building) and not in Food St, which is pretty but looks even more of a tourist trap than Newton. In the Chinatown food court, there are extensive numbers of stalls selling all kinds of foods. Make sure you go early as many were already shut by 8pm."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chinatown is sooo much better,-1,10,30-Jun-11,Honestly save your self the disappointment. You will get far better service food and prices in Chinatown
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's not that great!,-1,30,30-Jun-11,"This is a place for the tourists, the locals hardly patronise this area, as the food is more expensive than those served at the neighbourhood food centres. Furthermore, the food is not necessarily more delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still a rip-off,-1,30,28-May-11,"Yep they haven't changed. Coming back to this place after years. Last time I was here, there was an older chinese woman throwing up on the table. In spite of the 'no touting' signs the place crawls with them. The quality of the food is average at best. It is arguably possible to have a good dinner there while beating off the touts and trying to make sure you're not getting ripped off. But why bother? There are better places in Singapore and I for one will not be coming back."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average taste of food,-1,30,12/28/17,"The food is ranked averagely. But the service crew is very friendly. Food ordered are Pork belly + duck rice, soup, prawn Che Cheon Fun, Sao Bao and spring roll Che Cheong Fun."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Trying out this place famous for roasted duck,-1,10,11/12/2017,"A pure disappointment. The roasted duck skin is not crunchy and thus quite chewy. It ended up half of the serving, I had to leave it behind instead of into my stomach. The roasted pork belly, the first bite was ok. Then the second bite the meat is too hard. I m a food tasty. Definitely I have eaten much better ones. The Cheong Fun with roasted duck meat was a disaster. How can this dish be cold. Definitely not worth trying at all. Unable to eat this cold Cheong Fun"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OK food and bad service,-1,20,11/6/2017,The food in this restaurant was ok. The duck was good. The roast pork was ok. The carrot cake was soggy and tasted awful. The vegetable dishes and the carbs were all just ok.What was really bad about this restaurant was the service. The restaurant was understaffed and the waiters were simply overwhelmed. Some of them seemed very uninterested in serving the customers. I had to ask five times for rice and condiments. This needs to be improved.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Standards have dropped ,-1,20,08/18/17,"When this duck outlet first opened, the queues were always very long. It was worth the wait. The roast duck was fabulous and remain consistently good for the longest time.But after a recent visit in July 2017 standards had seriously fallen. And not surprisingly, no queues in sight ! I am forgiving. I will give it one more chance ! Perhaps it was just a bad day for the chef. We shall see. Alan Leong Singapore "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Chance,-1,30,05/20/17,"Nothing great. Pricey. I still prefer Ding Xiao Er. We just gave this craze a chance and will not be coming back for it. There are a lot more cheaper choices with the same quality. If not, same price but better."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London fat duck VivoCity outlet ,-1,30,5/9/2017,Duck was good.. the floor of the place is very slippery Becareful is walking in.. food was good the duck and the plum sauce goes very well.. but still abit pricey for me
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lame London Fat Duck,-1,30,04/18/17,"Tasty no doubt. The duck and the xiao long bao were prepared well. My big concern was the duck serving size. Almost half the duck served was bone. Nothing much to eat. Disappointing. Would have rated it 2 of 5, but the xiao long bao saved the day. Somehow. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nothing great,-1,30,4/8/2017,"The decor was nothing great. We ordered the duck pancakes(1/2 a duck), xo fried rice with duck, yeong chow fried rice, hakkaw, prawn spring roles, kai Lan etc. the ladies serving were nice. The food was average for me. In a place like Singapore they really will need to turn up the game to survive. For me it was not a meal to remember!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just not worth it!,-1,10,12/25/16,"Tried this restaurant for the second time. First time it was when it had just opened and the experience was not good. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and put it down to the teething problems of a business at the start. So, now after some time I decided to give it another try. Bottom line, I shouldn't have done so. Nothing changed. It is still the same terrible food, indifferent service and expensive for what it is. You are certainly better off in every aspect to go to the nearest food court or hawker center."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average,-1,30,12/20/16,"Average dimsum restaurant. The only dish i would recommend is Signature black pepper london duck bun. The London roast duck rice was also average too. For dessert, the mango puree with sago is good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Fat duck, inconsistent service ",-1,30,12/17/16,"We wanted a light lunch , hence ordered noodles with duck drum stick (extra $3), fish porridge and a bowl of wanton. Found the quality and taste of food average at most, but the duck drum was quite fatty in my opinion. However, some of the staff seemed to lack experience and worked at a snail's pace. They could improve on their professionalism and work pace. Prices are reasonable for it's Orchard location."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated for the Duck,-1,30,12/10/2016,"Roast Duck - Nothing special especially for $40 a duck.
I prefer the dim sum. Buns were very tasty. Reasonable and nice.
Service is poor - an older gentleman did all the work."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Ditch the reservation!,-1,10,12/4/2016,"Forget about trying to reserve a table for dinner. The service is useless and overwhelmed on tthe Saturday that we went. Despite making a reservation, no table was available when we got there. while one staff was clearing a table for us, another ushered a different group to the table and ifnored our protests that we had a reservation. In the end we left since the staff werent even interested in making any attempt to accomodate us. I wont even rate this restaurant a one but the app wont let me."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Might've been good,-1,20,11/27/16,"I was by myself, hungry, and only had a short time to eat, so decided to order 2 items for takeout from the dim sum menu. Half an hour later, I was still waiting. Not only was I starving, but I couldn't help but wonder why all the other patrons were getting their dim sum while I was just sitting there watching and waiting for my measly 2 to-go items. They weren't that busy. When I finally got up to inquire, for the second time, and say I was out of time to wait, the woman who took my order rushed into the kitchen and came back with one of the items (the black pepper duck buns) and then grabbed the other item that had been sitting on the counter for at least 20 minutes already, and said they made a fresh batch of the black pepper buns for me. That's nice and all, but the shrimp dumplings that were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes were now ice cold and greasy. It's too bad, I was excited to try this place, but won't give it another shot now."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Won't Queue For This,-1,30,11/21/16,"We went on a weekend and was fortunate we didn't have to queue for a table. The menu is focused mainly on the duck, roast meats, some noodle dishes and mainly dim sum. I wasn't impressed by the quality of the dim sum. The roast meats were better. The famous roast duck is pretty tender and tasty although I do find the duck to be on the skinny side. The food is not too bad but I won't queue for it should I visit the next time. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sucks !,-1,10,10/20/16,"This is not worth visiting if you are a duck lover. Is a HK joint and most likely operated by mainland chinese in the kitchen.The braised duck wings are salty, salty and salty that's all I could remember. I couldn't even finish the small portion of wings. Simply too salty for my taste. And is the worst I have in my entire life.Regretted and will ever step into this place agian."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,The duck is not fantastic,-1,20,09/26/16,"Ordered the duck bun, chee cheong fun, duck noodles, wanton noodles and duck porridge. But the duck meat is not crispy enough and not fragrant enough. The noodles texture is not bad but very very small portion. The porridge is too plain and tasteless. The chee cheong fun is alright. Prob won;t go back. The beijing duck from imperial treasure beats this ."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,The jury is out,-1,30,09/25/16,"@TheKuoKnowsI am in two minds about London Fat Duck. On the one hand the Roast Duck was quite superb. But on the other hand, the price seems a little steep at 48 bucks for a whole bird.That said, the duck was exquisite. A tasty skin enveloped a meaty duck"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner,-1,10,09/23/16,This place i strongly do not recommend as there are many houseflies flying around and disturb me and my friends while we have dinner. Heard is newly open in vivo city at basement 2. Wanted to try out but it was really dissappointing. The food is not tasty at all and to have so many houseflies flying around the table while having meal is horrible. All the service staffs are not attentive at all. Horrible horrible please do not waste your money.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Thinly sliced moon cake as ""pickles"" in my tab",-1,20,9/11/2016,"This being the moon cake festival in singapore, when a small dish of 4 thinly sliced moon cakes were served we thought it was for tasting so we could buy them home when our meal ends. At checkout we were told these were ""pickles"" and chargeable at $3. I requested for the bill to be retabulated since we were not told the cost beforehand. A rather non-transparent bit of marketing here, i wld say. Although they acceded to my request, this left a tinge of a bad taste to an otherwise juicy and fatty duck rice I had. Check your ""pickles"" when you come here. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OK,-1,30,9/4/2016,"Took our dad for Father's Day. Best dish was the signature crispy snow buns with duck. Ordered seconds.
Otherwise the dim sum are pretty standard."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck ... disappointing,-1,30,08/31/16,"We had heard so much about London Fat Duck and decided to check it out for ourselves. We ordered the Pork Congee with Century Egg, and Roast Duck Noodles. Both were pretty good. Unfortunately the rest of the dim sum items ordered did not hit the mark at all.The Duck Snow Buns were way too sweet; and so was the Steamed Chee Cheong Fun. The Shrimp in Crispy Beancurd Skin Fritters were super greasy and almost dripping in oil. The Crispy Black Pepper Duck Spring Rolls were indeed crispy but the filling was again too sweet and I found the black pepper to be overpowering. The panfried carrot cake was just average.My advice to the restaurant: stick to serving the roast meats and forget the dim sum."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat duck was skinny.....,-1,30,08/18/16,"Maybe they ran out of fat ducks....but ours was not especially juicy and fat like those in London. ...
Maybe they have lost their magic......
Duck also was that tasty....no different from what we can get from the food courts...."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,More Misses Than Hits,-1,20,8/12/2016,The signature roasted duck was fragrant and quite juicy. It was not bad but did not impress at all. Both the black pepper bun and crispy snow bun was good. The rest of the dishes was quite a disaster. 2 of items was almost uneatable: the jellyfish was too sour and the the char-siew was over burned. Service was not able to cope with the pack restaurant that afternoon. Overall it was a very disappointing lunch.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch ,-1,20,8/6/2016,Located in Scott's square. Food is so so only. The har kau skin is thick. I ordered their signature roast duck with roast pork as in photo. I was given the breast meat which consist mainly bones. Maybe just my unlucky day.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Average place. Decent food, not mindblowing but service was horrible.",-1,30,7/7/2016,"Being a fan of roast duck, I just had to try this new place out. There was a queue even though I decided to have an early dinner at around 5.30pm. Waited for around 30 minutes or so before we were shown to our table.We ordered the combination platter for 3 people, which was made up of some roast duck, roasted pork belly and char siew. We also ordered a plate of dumpling noodles and carrot cake.The roasted combination platter, although they said was for 3, was miserably small. The duck we were given was made up of mostly ribs. We should have tried ordering half a duck or something, which would give us a more well rounded taste of the bird. There was nothing spectacular about the duck I must say. The char siew on the other hand was pretty good! It had a nice smokiness about it with the flavors lingering in the mouth. Quite well done for local standards. The roasted pork belly was the best of the 3 meats. The meat was not too salty and the skin was beautifully crispy. It went perfectly well with the horseradish sauce. If I had to deduct points, I would deduct it for being too small a portion.The carrot cake was quite well done, it had nice chunks of white raddish embedded in it and the overall flavor was just nice. It wasn't overly greasy and went very well with the chilli sauce.The dumpling noodles were pretty average, nice fat dumplings but the portions were incredibly small. Thankfully that order was meant for a 4 year old who finished it quite easily. The service however, just like in most local places, leaves much to be desired. When we were nearly done with our meal, and I do mean nearly done, the waiters were overly enthusiastic about cleaning the table and started taking away the empty bowls and plates and some of the cutlery......leaving me to wonder how was I to finish off that last piece of carrot cake on the table. My daughter, who took a ""break"" during dinner to use the toilet, nearly had her bowl of noodles taken away as well and we had to tell the waiter that we weren't done a few times while his hands went all over the table. I can understand the rush but they missed out on us ordering desserts."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overpriced/Overrated,-1,30,06/30/16,"Most pieces of BBQ meat was burnt, duck was soft but the flavour wasn't there, the roasted pork was good with the mustard. Overall service was poor."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quick lunch & nothing special ... ,-1,30,05/31/16,"Heard so often there's London fat duck. Then, there's also 4 Seasons @ Capitol. At last, I am trying this London fat duck.Average is an understatement I must admit. The next rating is very good which honestly, it would be an overkill. Let's put it, it's GOOD.For the price I paid for today @ $26. It's overpriced for just a portion, with plain noodles n hot tea.I had an amazing portion in London @ four Seasons, same offering at a much lower price than Singapore. Furthermore, it was better.Let's put it this way. At $26. I won't be back for awhile.Duck 7/10Ambience : 6/10Service : 7/10"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-priced duck and pathetically small portion,-1,20,5/5/2016,"We were at the Waterway Point outlet last evening for dinner. Needed to wait 20 to 30 minutes for a table on a weekday night. We were attracted by the long queue to try the food there. The portions were pathetically small. Unreasonably over priced for everything, especially for the plate of duck noodles with only four thin slices of duck meat @$8.80 and tasted bland. When you asked for chilli, the waitress would forget totally even though you reminded her twice. That would be our first and last visit to London Fat Duck."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Overpriced Soggy Roast Duck and Roast Pork, Reheated Char Siew ",-1,10,5/4/2016,"Was at the Waterway Point outlet this evening for dinner. Waited for more than half an hour for a table at 7:30pm on a weekday night. Portions were small. Ridiculously over priced. Plain steamed rice was $2 per small bowl. 15 thin slices of char siew costs $12.80. First time, last time and one time too many!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It was just average,-1,30,5/2/2016,"No need to queue when I was at the Waterway Point outlet for a weekday late lunch.Tried the mixed roast platter (signature roast duck, crackling pork belly & bbq pork), black pepper bun and wanton noodle.I find the black pepper taste was too strong for the bun. The roast duck was nice, but nothing fantastic. The surprised was the pork belly. The skin was indeed crackling, while the meat was tender."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Basic,-1,30,04/28/16,"tried this at waterwaypoint mall (Punggol) ordered the signature duck congee and duck platter. food was basic so as the presentation. tasted clean though which was good.service was average. not friendly, not snobbish either. would be a good place to eat if you're just looking for something to fill the stomach but not really for culinary pleasure."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck @ Waterway Point,-1,10,04/21/16,"Crispy duck but the skin is not crisp but chewy.The filling inside the signature bun is sweet, taste more like chopped up bbq pork than duck! We ordered the original flavour without the pepper. Was served the pepper ones but as it is our first time in the restaurant and they do not have any me use with pictures for you to see while seated, we therefore was not aware that they had served u the pepper version until we took one and cut up to try. We told the waitress and they only replaced with 2 buns instead of the whole plate of 3! It's not our fault if they serve the wrong item but why should we be have only 2 out of 3 replaced! Chinese tea is not even warm let alone hot.The dish servings are very pathetic for the price ."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not to my expectation,-1,30,04/20/16,"Prior to the dinner, I admit I had too high expectation on the food and this seemed to lower my dining experience. The theme of the dinner- London fat duck, as the name implies, the duck is indeed fat. Hence after the 5th or 6th piece of the duck, we got really full and felt sick of eating more. The restaurant also served other dim sum but the taste was so-so only."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London duck,-1,10,4/10/2016,So so only. I can confirm it is not even near the look and taste on London roasted duck. Quite disappointed
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over-hyped.,-1,20,4/8/2016,"With all the rave about the ""Wagyu of Duck"", I decided to try it out for myself. Let's start with the food. To be honest, the duck tasted pretty average to me. I personally prefer their Char Siew better than the Roasted Duck (and my girlfriends agreed too). Besides that, the rest of the dishes are alright. I won't say it's fantastic or like out-of-this-world. But if you do head down and try, do try their Duck Bun and Egg Tarts. That I recommend. Be warned though. With the expected waiting time (since they just opened and everyone wants a piece of their duck), the place was a little messy and chaotic. The plus point for them for our night there is the lovely wait-staff who was assisting us (just that one nice auntie) and that the food came almost instantaneously.Now, I can say ""I've been there, done that."""
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It was ok,-1,30,4/3/2016,"It was ok. Some strange flavour combinations. Food was freshly cooked and good quality.
Could find better valued meals elsewhere."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very fat duck indeed!,-1,30,03/25/16,I find the restaurant name cute although I can't quite connect London and fat duck. The food served here is Cantonese cuisine. Roasted duck is very fatty and a little too salty so this experience may be rather scary for health conscious eaters. I prefer the Char Siew meat as it is pretty well done. Food quality is good but not exceptional. I do know of hawker stalls that serve similar or higher quality roasted duck.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food quality so so only. Duck is too fat. Lousy customer service.,-1,20,03/20/16,"We ordered the duck noodle. The duck tasted so so only. It had way too much fat for our liking. The noodle was bland and had very little sauce on it. I didn't take the veg because the leaf hung out of the plate and touched the table - disrespectful of the food and the customers they serve.Biggest turnoff: The service staff put the dishes meant for the table besides us on our small and cramp table while they made space over there. They neither asked for our permission nor apologised for the inconvenience and discomfort caused. They couldn't be bothered whether it disturbed our dining pleasure. I will NEVER eat there again, ever!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Can't even surpass duck rice Ina hawker centre,-1,10,3/12/2016,"We ordered duck with rice, crackling pork with rice, each dish $7.80. It came with one half stalk of xiaobaicai, and just a splash of sauce. The duck was powdery to taste. It was quite honestly a big disappointment and there are many hawker centres which would easily surpass this restaurant in standard. A dish of oyster veg also cost $$7.80, consisting of eight half stalks of xiaobaicai boiled and splashed with oyster sauce. There was no queue. We told the wait staff that the food was not acceptable. She thought we were talking about the rice itself, and could not believe that we were talking about the duck. Never again "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is fat,-1,30,3/7/2016,"Visited the shop twice. The duck is tasty but is fat. Noodle with roasted pork is nice. Overall, foods are good but not the best in town."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck but average dim sum,-1,30,3/7/2016,"Xiao Long Bao is juicy and meaty but the dipping sauce is salty with little ginger . Dried wanton noodle is eaten best with chilli sauce , only comment is quite pricy with little noodles served. ""Ting chai"" congee is actually congee with cuttlefish and peanuts . But the peanuts too hard. Duck is juicy and oily , if you don't mind the oil. Meat is tender. Service is good. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over HYPED ,-1,20,3/5/2016,"For the branding I would have to say really smart putting the name ""London"" in there. I bet many people would have mistaken this place coming from London, only the duck and it's not even from London it's from Ireland.Anyway enough of the history lesson, here is my verdict and as a fan of roast duck, I have my fare share of top ducks around HKG and London this one rank lowly if I were to compare with any of the restaurants I've tried.Taste wise i would have to agree the fats of the duck is really juicy but the let down came with the tenderness and the sauce let alone presentation (not that Goldmine has any beautiful presentation) but I just can't accept the pungent after taste you get.The Char siew is dry and bored with overly sweeten sauce. Wanton noodle was good with plump shrimps Wanton and al dente noodle but soup was just overly salty to my liking.The redeemer here is the liu sha bao, all I have to say try is their dim sum more than what they are known for.Don't expect much service as wait staff seems clueless at times and I was served the wrong dish. Was at the Punggol outlet at 10.15am. If you want duck.. I suggest you going to other places"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Appalling Service,-1,10,3/1/2016,"Food was alright, no wow factor. We were truly disappointed with the service, rude and unreliable. I also ordered take away however they missed out a few items on the list but yet I was charged for the dimsum. And when I returned a couple of days later to claim the missing items, the service staff was not happy. Did not even apologise!Extremely poor service!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not as good as the first time,-1,30,02/27/16,The duck was a disappointment this time. It tasted a bitter and was rather fat. The dim sums were good but nothing to shout about. However the custard buns were worth eating. They were uniquely baked with pandan on the outside
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average,-1,30,2/3/2016,"We were disappointed with the poor service, very small meal sizes and expensive for what you got. The food was ok, plenty of other better places in Singapore to go. Wouldn't go back."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Singapore Oily Bird,-1,20,01/28/16,"So what if they source their ducks from a renowned farm in London? Without the know-how and skills, even if they use some sort of celestial phoenix, it will still taste mortally cheap.However, London Fat Duck achieved in proving to be a model example of Marketing 101.So A for marketing, a big fat and oily F for everything else."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over rated!,-1,30,01/20/16,"Before today I had only ordered takeaway char siew which was nice and tender but expensive @ $15.90 for 11 small slices. Not sure that it was worth it. I had also ordered the black pepper duck buns (all good - moist, tender duck, soft bun - except maybe a bit too much of the black pepper).Today I had a late lunch in the restaurant. By the way, they have taken additional space (see photo). Had duck noodles and warm barley. Duck was tender, skin not crispy at all. I had to remove the fat but alas the skin came off too. Barley was not even warm. Waiters and Waitresses in Singapore food outlets have a problem understanding 'hot', 'warm' & 'luke warm'.So my conclusion is that it is not 'die, die must eat'."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overcharging poor service,-1,20,01/17/16,"Used to like this place a lot for the food - would have given 5 stars thenNow, Duck and noodles the only things worth making the trip forService is poor, even worse than HK fast food restaurants - part time staff are better than the full timersToo many things wrong with the service to listTip - dont go for meals In between times just have a plate of duck and noodlesTip 2 - costs less per head if u bring small children as their tables are strictly per head and not by the amount of food you order (they will clear unfinished plates to make room for all the dishes you order if you order 'too many' dishesTip 3 - check the bill, overcharging happened more than onceOtherwise you'd do better at a more upscale dim sum restaurant w/out overcrowding, condescending attitudes and staff chasing you out so that they can pack in the next bunch of familiesOr if you're just into noodles, for similar quality noodles (sadly, no irish ducks) go to Maks at CentrepointAverage bill for 2 - US$70 without beverages"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a fat duck with HK attitude,-1,30,1/9/2016,"It's an aircon eatery, your typical modern HK roasted meat shop in a mall. The service is something you need to manage your own expectations, do not expect well trained staff. You won't get patient introduction of each dish, or recommendations, you are quite expected to write down what you want on the menu paper and have little chit chat. That said, the duck is good, noodles decent, soup is the usual HK too salty type, wanton noodles, dim sum, etc are average. I would come back again, but not often. The food is decent for the price you pay. But that said, you can get very similar standard at any neighborhood coffee shop roasted meat delights stalls. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very fatty Duck,-1,30,1/4/2016,"Ordered normal very fatty Duck, tasty and nice Pork Belly, over burn at the side of Char Siew tasted bitter and satringent rice and noodle.
Told the waitess, she scine unhappy to take my comment."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Okay Duck and DIm Sum,-1,30,1/3/2016,"We had our 2015 Countdown in Singapore. My Sister insist that we visit this place as she had a good experiences here and compared it with the duck we had in London.Was told that this place is usually pack and queue up to two hours!! We went early New Year (1 Jan 2016) morning (10:00am), since everyone still suffering from hangover during countdown (haahaahaa)....We ordered duck, pork belly, char Siew, and dim sums.The duck is good but not great. Quite bony. Crispy Pork Belly and Char-Siew are better.Dim Sum are not bad too. The Crispy Char-Siew Pao is a must tryThe plain noodle is quite tough, not good.When we finished around 11:15am, the queue already formed. Overall, its okay food. Give it at try.The place is in Basement 1 (B1) Scott Square Orchard Road) The building next to Tang Plaza (which is opposite ION)"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,2nd try for egg tarts,-1,30,1/1/2016,"Went around 6pm. Luckily the crowd is not big. Manage to get a table for 2. Try the duck noodle, duck peppers poa, chicken legs n red beans jelly. The noodle is salty n nothing special. Ask for egg tarts but is out of stock. They don't have time to make the base. Will try another time..."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck was not the star!,-1,30,11/28/15,"Visited the London Fat Duck today. We had the Roast Duck, crispy Pork Belly, Char Siew Bao crispy buns and Cheong Fun. With Chinese tea and Barley the total bill was just over $50. The star dish was the pork belly. The duck was so-so with a lot of bone and not too much meat. I would not go back for the duck but the other dishes were good. Service was quick and efficient. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,So so duck....,-1,30,11/21/15,Previously when it opened the queues were long and the duck was juicy and delicious....Went back recently and we were able to get a table easily (has the interest died?)....and the duck was not as good as before. ...And they only have one type.of vegetable.....no choice....
Chinese,London Fat Duck,On the fence,-1,30,11/13/15,"Had lunch with friends about a month ago and we all found the duck and char siew pretty yummy. I like my pork slightly fatty and the char siew at London Fat Duck had just the right balance, in my opinion. It was also nicely charred on the outside. The duck meat was moist and tender. And not gamey. Service was prompt. I returned once to do a takeaway. Something I wouldn't do again. The taste just wasn't the same and everyone at home felt it was no better than the roast duck at our nearby food centre. This proves once again that many foods are best eaten on the spot. I'd be happy to go back to London Fat Duck for that plate of duck noodles or char siew rice if there isn't any queue."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Great Duck, Lousy Service ",-1,20,10/19/15,"This review is not about the food as I have reviewed this before. Have the much applauded roast duck as well as roast meats but you certainly don't come here for the exemplary service.Firstly I have to say my expectations are minimal as this is not a fine dining restaurant, just your basic Chinese eatery. Having established this, I would have to express shock at being driven out after 40 minutes. This is something that has never happened to me. Ever.I had lunch with friends & while there was never any intention to linger, even my friends were shocked at the level of rudeness when we were asked to leave after the last dish was cleared. There was no attempt to ask if we cared for dessert. Last time I ate here, service was brusque & I did not expect much. In future if I craved the duck, it would be better to get take out rather than sit through this sort of treatment. It isn't worth it & we weren't even demanding customers. All we asked was to be able to leave when we were ready. By the way it was the tail end of lunch & there certainly wasn't a queue."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just alright...,-1,30,10/2/2015,"Waited for more than 30mins on a Friday dinner. Worth the wait? I don't think so. Can get half the price for the duck noodle at hawker, with similar or better taste. For those who like the duck snow bun, can give it a try. Sweet and crispy. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not impressed,-1,10,09/27/15,"If I am not mistaken, this restaurant is inspired by the four seasons and gold mine in bayswater, London. We had the roast duck, char siew, egg tart, duck snow bun and weren't impressed with either of the items. The duck fat wasn't rendered at all - the roast roast duck had thick slab of fat between the skin and meat. I didn't know they meant the name London fat duck that literally. In my opinion, the ideal roast duck should have succulent meat texture but with minimal visual fat between the skin and meat. The meat was kind of dry in this case. Char siew was okay, loads of honey. Egg tart had more flour taste than egg. The duck snow bun needs improvement because the snow bun is sweet with the powdered sugar on top, the duck sauce was even sweeter. Just a quarter of this snow bun sends you in line for diabetes. I guess we just expected so much more because we liked the four season's version of roast duck and when we visited the restaurant, we had the impression that it would be similar."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the Duck!,-1,30,08/31/15,"Ok, the name is attractive. Expect to queue since the restaurant doesn't take reservations. The duck is fatty, dripping with oil, succulent, sinful i.e. tasty. The other must-try dish is the pepper-flavoured duck meat bun which is freshly baked. Apart from these, I had tried the char siew and the roast meat, both of which seemed a tad ordinary. But the duck is worth coming back for. Service is quite prompt and courteous. A crowd-puller in the otherwise quiet basement of Scotts Square. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is great,-1,30,08/28/15,"Decided to bring my in-laws to this new duck outlet for dinner after knowing that the brand now has a branch here in singapore as i am a big fan of roasted duck.First impression was that the restaurant felt more like a food court. We were directed to the VIP room. The VIP room consists of 2 large tables and sadly, the other group in our room was very noisy and rowdy as its a group consisted of all men, most like colleagues. Anyway, the background music was also very loud and thus, very irritating. Called the server to ask them to turn down the volume but told me cannot be done. Asked her to get her manager and after her manager came in, he decided to lower the volume.Service is only so-so and atmosphere as well. But the duck is good in my opinion. But i expect a complete dining experience as the food here is not really cheap as well. Wanted to change the size of the dishes we ordered after they served them and we realised its too little for all of us. The server told us that we cannot do it. I was so puzzled why not as simply they could bring back the medium plate of duck and add more to it. Instead she asked me to order another medium plate which made the whole meal more expensive.If its not for the service and atmosphere, i would have given it a 4 out of 5!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Long wait for slightly above average food,-1,30,08/23/15,"Arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night and saw a small crowd already waiting. Was told the wait will be about 20 mins which was acceptable but instead we waited for almost 45 mins before given a table for 7 of us.As mentioned the place is more a cafeteria style whereby you select from the order chit the food you wanted. Looking at the prices, would same it is reasonable considering the location and service is much better than expected.The side dishes such as the porridge is good as well as the duck bun.However the duck as mentioned is very fatty to suit me though the skin is rightly roasted. They should work on improving the choices of vegetables though as there is only 1 item. Overall the price is reasonable but not worth the wait."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A shame to call it London . .,-1,30,8/2/2015,"I have lived many year in London,"" though many years ago "". . and love the duck served in the Chines restaurants there. The duck here does not live up to any that I have had in London, in any restaurants there.I like the buns with a sweet black peber crust though . and i am glad I went for these.I will only go if I was close by . . again"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat Duck!!!,-1,30,07/30/15,"I am not a fans of Duck meat but London Fat Duck had left a deep impression in my mouth. For health conscious people might not like the fatness of the meat. I Iove the fatness of the meat, soft to chew and the roasted Skin is crisp, goes very well with the plum sauce. Tried their signature Chee Cheong Fun, it's actually the fried prawn spring roll wrap with Chee Cheong Fun, interesting combine and its delicious. Black Pepper duck Snow Bun taste like McDonald's Prosperity burger. Overall feel the food is good but might not want to queue too long for a table. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Over Hype Average Food,-1,30,7/5/2015,"LFD is not related to the Four Seasons Restaurant in London and also has nothing to do with the Fat Duck in UK. Instead the ducks were claimed to be Irish. It is only a typical Hong Kong style Cantonese restaurant.Although the shop names emphasised on duck, you can also find many others Hong Kong style dim sum, wanton noodle and etc. The roast ducks is nice but not fantastically nice. The ducks served was fat and juicy. On the other hand the Honey sauced Char Siew is surprisingly good. Fat but not greasy. We didn't get to try the roast pork. The other dim sum and dumpling that we had ordered are actually quite authentically Hong Kong that you can find it in any Hong Kong street stalls.The time we visited the restaurant was on a Saturday evening and long queue had already formed and we have to wait for 50 mins to get our table. By the time our turn was up at 8pm, many items on the menu had been sold out.The pricing of the food is at mid range and mostly appropriately priced except the white rice that cost us SGD2.50 per bowl which is outrageous.Verdict is the food is good, price is reasonable and location is good so we don't mind coming back again if the waiting time can be shorter."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nothing much special,-1,10,7/1/2015,"I was waiting for someone to assist me to be seated when a guy approached me and lead me to the table.. however, i was directed to one of the table that was dirty and seems that the previous customer had just left. . I dont mind seating but the impression could have been better if they seated me to a clean and already set up table (which they have few coz they werent that busy much when i came)..anyway i order congee with century egg.. shrimp spring roll and an ice tea.. congee came befire the drinks and it would be better if they add a little bit of veggies or perhps like spring onion inside to shrimp springroll coz it tastes to plain.. neverthe less the congee tastes ok.. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat Duck,-1,30,06/22/15,"Came here for lunch . Had dim sum and the signiture fat duck. Duck was good, dim sum was average. Service is ok."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the duck and buns. Forget the rest.,-1,30,06/21/15,Singapore hawker food is hard to beat. Fat duck buns are tasty although a bit too sweet for me. The duck has enough taste and texture to warrant another visit if you are around the area and need a quick duck fix. The char siew deserves be a mention but is priced more than its weight in gold. Long live the hawker centers!! 
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Don't be a sheep to give in to media manipulations. Riding on a bad pun of another restaurant.,-1,10,06/21/15,"Well, as stated above. my fellow Singaporeans, open your eyes and stop being media manipulated.The food is bad, seriously bad. And with prices like that, i scoff in disgust. Apparently not the 45min-1hr wait time crowd.when you are charging $12-15++ per portion of roasted meat, it better be freaking good, ESPECIALLY if that said portion is only enough for 1 person.Duck - tasteless, soggy skin, crappy 'sauce' ( 70% oil in sauce )Roast Pork - ridiculous portion (i literally laughed), Damn dry. Saw them microwaving some food items, perhaps it's pork?Char siew- passable, too sweet and cloying. Perfect if it's candied pork not char siew.Duck buns (Both black and white) - While the bun itself was good, the filling was Crap. too much Starch in the generic store-bought sauce with duck skin, barely (virtually none) any duck meat.Beef noodle soup - forgettable, with that much MSG, water also taste good.close to $100 for 3 pax, first and last time i get sheared like a sheep. Maybe the reason they omitted pricing on their website's menu is out of shame?Avoid this money focused mill. Even the roast pork stall inside serangoon nex NTUC was far superior (Not that they were any good to begin with) Felt like a tourist being sheared while leaving.Alternatives to good roasted duck is Dian xiao er, or any other place that doesn't take you for a fool."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OVER-RATED: Soon to be Dead-Duck!,-1,30,06/20/15,"Mediocre.There is NOTHING to rave about this restaurant.Their roast duck is slightly above average standards but way to fatty and oily in my personal opinion. Also, though the meat was pretty tender, it didn't have much taste to it - like the marinate hadn't settled into the meat.The rest of the dim sum and food were extremely average, nothing you cannot find in Singapore.This is a try once sort of restaurant that does not have any offerings that would attract you back the second time."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London fat duck review,-1,10,06/19/15,"Although I am a lover of fatty food but thought the duck is too fat for my liking. The duck bun is good though. What surprised me is the bad service and attitude. We ordered quite a lot of food and when we are about 80 % done, the manager came and ask if we want any dessert, we answered no and he showed an unhappy face and said ""if you don't mind hurry up, there was a long queue"". We are only there for 1/2 an hour (including waiting 10 minutes for the food) and we are fast eater. The manager also ordered the waiters to collect the plates while we were eating, at first I thought they wanted to change plates, but no, the replacement never came until I asked. Anyway I wont go there again, duck nothing to shout about and I think I prefer dian xiao er."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,london fat duck the duck is fat but Tim sum dishes is good.,-1,30,06/16/15,"when to try the London fat duck after the review. the 1st time we are lucky when in on a Saturday morning after 10 am not crowded no queue.you have to queue because the place is small sitting limited not that is so good that you queue.order their famous/popular dishes the duck taste good though is fat, the char siew is nice but expensive ($14.80 for about 10-12 small slice)had the wanton noodle not bad like hong kong noodle. price $6.80 per bowl.had some take away the snow bun, duck and char siew and duck dumpling. the duck dumpling is very ordinary nothing to shout about is like normal hong kong dumpling.with bean.($12.90)a week later went with some friend to try the food. This time I order the tim sum. the spring roll, chee cheong fun with do fritter & prawn, pan fried carrot cake, siew mai, they are good. Also order the fat duck and snow bun and char siew . but this time round the fat duck is really fat and oily don't think will order again.the service and knowledge from the staff of the little restaurant is poor in serving their customer.not well train if you don't mind the attitude and their reply concentrate on the food is not bad but is differently not worth to queue for long hours.order custard bun they said no stock. how to be no stock when your restaurant just open for business either the chef don't make the bun or..... don't expect any service just make do and try the food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,just a matter of personal taste,-1,30,05/29/15,"a lot of people talk about this restaurant thought the food was OK not bad but also not inline with the prices and the expectations
will go back prefer the duck at MJ1N, just a matter of personal taste"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum Dinner,-1,30,12/19/17,"We ordered Scallop Congee, shark fin soup, char siew bun, prawn dumpling, deep fried prawn in the tofu skin and two desserts. The congee was not good, shark fin..so so. We waited for about 35mins before we are being served. Prices are a bit overpriced and the quality of food has gone down. Maybe we will try out another branch."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Quality of food has gone down,-1,20,05/30/17,"We (3 adults & 1 child) used to frequent this place in the past, but on our last visit, found that the quality of the food has gone down, presumably due to it being packed out at dinner time. Victim of its own success perhaps?Food:The dim sum quality is fine, but the fried rice is now of below average quality (fewer pricey ingredients such as prawns, just full of eggs, over-salted). The fried noodles with mushrooms were also of below average quality, with few mushrooms and nothing else other than soy sauce.Service: Too few waiting staff for the number of tables. One dish got lost in the order, and was served very late after our reminder.Would we go back again? Not in a hurry. Not at busy times."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Terrible Service and extra charges,-1,20,3/1/2017,"Crystal Jade has had a reputation for good dim sum dishes.The food is still quite good though below the standards it used to set.The BBQ pork roll and SiewMai we had were both quite tasteless,for instance.The service is terrible-the waitresses ignored us for as long as possible then were unhelpful when we made some simple questions about the dishes.The table was dirty and still not properly cleaned after they came to clean it.Annoying in particular were the extra charges.For instance we asked for two glasses of iced water (hardly San Pellegrino!) and we were charged for them.The rather tired pickles already on the table when we sat down were charged for,as were the paper towels."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average,-1,30,2/7/2017,"Standards keep dropping .... as they loss many of their Chef....
Service also varies between peak and non peak hours."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average place,-1,30,01/26/17,The food is average. But unfortunately the service is lacking. They might need to train the non-chinese speaking staff to take orders better as they didnt get my order correct the first time.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Beef floating in fat,-1,30,1/1/2017,"Customer service is just terrible, there is maybe only one who really likes her job.. other don't smile, take orders in hurry, doesn't speak clearly etc.But it seemed they were extremely friendly for locals, who could speak Chinese..Also food quality compared to price is not good. My beef was floating in the fat and oil, and I just couldn't eat it.However fish and vegetarian food tastes very good! So I'll recommend to choose fish or vegetarian food, if you want to go there :)"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Changes menu a lot,-1,30,07/16/15,"I've been to Crystal Jade in Holland Village 5 times in the past 3 years. It is usually crowded during lunch time, when the air-conditioned room upstairs is open. They close it after 2 or 3pm, when it is less crowded and you'll have to dine downstairs (no air-conditioning, fans only). Food quality of dim sum (dumplings, congee etc) is good and authentic, close to what you'd get in dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. We liked their seafood fried cheongfun/horfun. Service was average during lunch hours (when they are busiest), slightly better later in the afternoon. I did find myself feeling abnormally thirsty after my most recent trip in July 2015, possibly due to increased MSG levels in the food."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Brunch,-1,30,5/9/2015,"Food was as good as expected. Crowded. Looks a bit understaffed. Though we were served, my request for a cup of cold water was not given even after I paid the bill."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Rustic,-1,30,02/18/15,"Crystal jade standards have certainly dropped over the years and Imperial Treasure is the chain to go for good chinese food. Anyway, we couldn't stand the line for kiddy Nakhon in holland village and popped by Crystal jade for the dinner alternativeit's chinese new year season so we ordered the yusheng and well as standard dishes - roast meat combo, stir fried vegetables, tofu in claypot and sweet and sour fish. They were all ok/average, and hence the problem for crystal jade. it's not enough to be just ok these daysOverall, a rustic, ok place for a meal. don't expect anything special"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Sad Chinese Meal,-1,20,10/29/14,"We went to this restaurant late, maybe the staff was tired because we waited 20 mins to be seated despite the seats visibly available. Then it took a long time for some one to take our order, problem is they leave a menu and a sheet which you write the corresponding no. No one can explain the dishes.What we order was not available and what we finally got was pretty awful. It did not suit our taste. All in all it was a lousy dining experience in a fancy restaurant on our second night in Singapore. I would recommend you go there if you have someone who understands chinese food and who can help you order."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Not so nice food,-1,30,09/28/14,"The foods are blunt.the dumplings look so aweful. But to be fair, service was quite ok so im giving it an average rating"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,'OUT OF SHAPE' DUMPLING,-1,30,6/2/2014,Visited the restaurant at Dhoby Ghaut 1 wk ago..Very disappointed with their dumpling..its not tasty and the glutinous rice is so soggy..it does not have the shape of a dumpling when opened..the rice is drooping and the ingredients esp the meat is not tasty.. Really not worth the money..Selling at $5.80!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,good food. poor service,-1,30,3/2/2014,"We just ate at Crystal Jade Holland Viilage (we have come here many times). This time we found the service to he horrible. We ordered egg tarts. They indicated that they no longer sell these. Instead we had to go to the Crstal Jade takeaway ourselves and bring to the table. When our food came, one dish was not what we intended. The waitress was quickly pointed out that we had disordered and forced us to take this dish rather what we wanted. Very disappointing."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,WestGate outlet staff chasing diner to finish meal,-1,10,3/1/2014,Poor service and staff keep asking to clear table even my daughter is eating and there are still food in the dishes. It is even more frustrating that a staff told us off that others are waiting !!We are only there for about an hour and the waiting time for food is longer than we enjoy it. The total bill for this dinner is sgd170 for 3 of us and we expect some minimum respect as a customer of Crystal Jade
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Authentic Cantonese,-1,30,12/13/13,"There's nothing really special about the Clementi Mall Crystal Jade - crispy roast pork OK, diced pork & snake bean tasty but small serve, watercress soup was tasty but ordinary by Chinese standards, prawn with egg & broccoli a bit bland, the best dish was a silken tofu that you'd think was egg. A la carte price was fair but the set menu prices were exorbitant - much better value ordering a la carte. Service was prompt but disinterested."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Concerning,-1,10,11/26/13,"I am conflicted about writing this but I feel too compelled that I must share our experience over the weekend. We have come here before and have found the food and ambiance to be quite nice but this past weekend was a different story.We arrived at 9:30am with our toddler and asked for one of the open tables. The hostess said they were out of many things and said we should look at the menu before we sit down. True enough they were but we said we wanted to sit anyway. We asked for one of the outside tables and were told they could not accommodate a third chair or high chair for the baby. We said ok and waited for an inside table and the hostess did nothing. We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside tables with just two seats and I would have the baby sit in my lap. The hostess then said not enough space (if you have seen the tables you know they are certainly large enough). it was very clear they didn't want us there and so we started to walk away and my wife then spoke in Chinese about how disappointed she was and the hostess looked shocked that my wife knows the language. We left and won't be back, but on the upside had an amazing breakfast at the Holland V hawker center. Truly a shame."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lousy Service!,-1,20,03/14/13,"This is probably the oldest and most established Crystal Jade, but now it's one of the most disappointing ""fine-dining"" outlets. It's ok that we have to queue for this seemingly popular restaurant, but to be ushered in like refugees, asked to order food quickly, and being served in a hurried manner AND worst of all, no smile, made one lose appetite. I'm not even talking about the weekend crowd! Worst of the lot are the managers dressed in black suits. The most friendly people are the older lady waiters. Food standards have also dropped, and mind you, I've eaten here since its opening!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Nice enough Chinese food,-1,30,2/4/2013,"Popular with locals, reasonably priced, straightforward Chinese food...
Would go there again if I was passing"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Chinese Cuisine - Dim sum,-1,30,1/2/2013,Had lunch there with friends. Food was just okay. Many variety sold out by noon on 27th Dec when I was there. Hong Kong style food. Located in few places in Singapore.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,POOR POOR POOR SERVICE,-1,10,03/26/12,"Dine at Crystal Jade, Takashimaya, Order a Chicken with wonton soup, a bowl of rice and a plate of two combination of char siew & roast pork but char siew of sold out so change to duck but wanted the lower portion, told her in mandarin, my goodness, the Manager told me she don't understand what is lower portion(in Mandarin). Then told her is alright, I shall canel the order for two combination, just the soup and a bowl of rice.Soup came, but not rice, so ask the Manager, she said ok will bring. Waited for 10 mins my little girl almost finished the soup and rice not here, went to check with the Manager again she said sorry she forgotten.The company should send their staff for training for service and name of the parts of the DUCK.If I have a choice, this outlet is OUT of my dining list."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Fast and decent Chinese food. Don't expect a long leisurely dinner!,-1,30,03/19/12,"For fast and decent Chinese food in the ever-crowded Holland Village, it's hard to beat the massively popular chain, Crystal Jade. From fried rice to dim sum, it's consistently good and the service is wickedly fast. That means, however, you'd not be able to enjoy dinner in a leisurely manner, hold hands and stare into your spouse's eyes lovingly. It's strictly dine and dash here. It's my default place for Chinese food when in this area if the crowd gets a bit too much - which is often. You do have to wait on busy nights, but the lines do move pretty fast."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Peking Duck,-1,30,2/9/2012,"Love it there. Maybe because they do it the Cantonese way, maybe not the best around, but it could be the better ones you could get at that price. Worth a try."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,seems a bit worn and pushy,-1,20,10/10/2011,We found the staff to be prompt but pushy. They tried to upsell us on every item. for what we got it was expensive.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Better than average Cantonese dishes,-1,30,5/10/2010,My Chinese wife likes this place a lot. Personally I think it's good enough but I wouldn't distinguish it from many other Chinese restaurants. However I defer to her greater knowledge of the Chinese food scene in Singapore.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,What service?????,-1,10,07/13/09,"A very strange experience indeed. We walked in to a 10% filled restaurant and there were lots of waitresses standing around. Menu was quickly placed on our table, after a few minutes, no one asked if we were ready. Another few minutes, we got impatient...More"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,So so. Can try if got not fussy.,-1,20,7/6/2008,So so. Can try if got not fussy.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"Crowded, not bad in taste",-1,30,06/26/08,"Crowded, not bad in taste"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Food is alright only. Not worth the price.,-1,20,06/15/08,Food is alright only. Not worth the price.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very average Chinese food.,-1,20,05/27/08,Very average Chinese food.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Typical efficient chain...,-1,20,4/9/2008,Typical efficient chain. Their la mian varies in quality because the staff let it sit on the counter and lose the 'al dente-ness'. Good for the price.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Decent food,-1,30,02/28/08,Decent food
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good ....,-1,30,2/8/2008,Good ....
Chinese,Crystal Jade,was quite diasppointed when I realised that they changed their menu not long ago. (They cancel 1 of the desserts that...,-1,30,2/4/2008,"was quite diasppointed when I realised that they changed their menu not long ago. (They cancel 1 of the desserts that was once in my 'must order' list). The menu features a few different types of ramen. However when we try to order them, The waitress notify us that they only serve the normal ramen. The standard is as normal. The desserts variaties is reduced, I managed to try the rice wine dumplings though and it turns out to be quite unexpected. As in the rice wine smell was quite strong and different from what I had outside. But overall it is quite ok."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,-1,30,8/7/2018,"As a Cantonese, average dimsum cannot really be tolerated. Below are those I have eaten:-1) Chee Cheong Fun - Unacceptable skin smoothness, it's rough and I can't even eat it .2) Char Siew Pau - It looks presentable but it's all pastry (flour) and limited meat. 3) Prawn Wanton Crisps - Will never order again. Fillings not solid.4) Meat Dumpling in Chilli Oil - Should be renamed to Meat Dumpling in Vinegar which is all to it. What's Good/Acceptable1) Egg Tart2) Mango Pudding (Slightly on the sweeter side)3) Xiao Long Bai - Rough skin but love the element of rice wine.4) Xiao Mai and Har Gao - Solid and tasty. 5) Double Boiled Soup - Yummy!6) Leaned Meat with Century Egg Congee - OkI won't list it all down. Go give it a try if you are a Safra Member or Maybank Card Holder. We came for High-Tea Buffet and we are satisfied. Value for money. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha worst ever experience,-1,10,07/14/18,"I think a lot of customers will regret coming to this restaurant like myself and my family. The food is average and the service is extremely bad, especially when taking away the leftovers, they will lump everything into one box of different varieties like junk. When approach the stuff, they responded with very bad attitude and forcing us to accept their insincere apology. BE CAREFUL of coming to this place."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,-1,20,06/29/18,Foods taste average. Nothing much special. Environment is a bit smelly unsure why. Not crowded. Easy accessable. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Ok - quite heavy ,-1,30,06/25/18,In fairness we may have made poor choices! The dim sum did seem to be more substantial than flavourful. Nice environment and staff.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced and overrated ,-1,20,05/28/18,"After a number of recommendations, we went to this restaurant for dinner. We ordered 3 dumpling dishes, a roast pork dish, vegetables and drinks.I’ve had MUCH better food in Sydney for a much cheaper price in very much nicer surroundings. In fact, I’ve had way better dumplings at our Thursday night street markets.To add insult to an already poor meal, we ordered a glass of beer each that turned out to be $10.50. EACH!Even worse, we were given a bowl of peanuts (not requested) and a packaged wet wipe each (also not requested) and upon reading our payment receipt, found we were charged for these items. There were no napkins provided at the table.The decor is old and depressing and everything just looks and feels like the place has seen long gone, much better days. We’ve eaten at all kinds of street vendors throughout SE Asia, we’re definitely not picky, fussy customers but I can also say that we’ve enjoyed a $10 meal 100 times more than we enjoyed this.Don’t waste your time or money, we just wasted $90 so that we can save anyone reading this from wasting their money too."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum on wheels,-1,20,05/28/18,The unique selling point is the dim sum trolleys which brought back nostalgic memories when I was a child in Hong Kong. But that’s about it. The food is pretty average. The place is a bit tattered. Staff not particularly responsive. Any novelty value wears off very quickly. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Roast pork was disappointing,-1,30,04/16/18,"Brought some friends from Switzerland for lunch there. Most of the dim sum were good except for the roast pork. The skin was not crispy at all and the meat was 80% fat and 20% lean.
Prices were a little on the high side."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Went downhill,-1,30,4/5/2018,"We used to live in Singapore three years ago, and Yum Cha was one of the places we'd go to get good local Chinese food. The atmosphere used to be lively, as it was full of people. The food was still good, but there were only three other tables occupied throughout the time we were there for dinner. There are better places to go now. Sadly, it is not like it used to be."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Underwhelming - there must be better restaurants in China Town,-1,30,3/6/2018,I was really underwhelmed about this restaurant which is a shame as there are so many other places nearby which I passed to get here!The restaurant is well signed posted but so be sure to look up as the restaurant is located on the second floor. It has air conditioning which is a plus.The staff were as helpful as they could be given that their English was so limited. We struggled but found a way to communicate.I found the food very oily. My spring rolls were literally dripping with oil which was not very appetizing. As for for the rest - it was okay - average at best.I would not return simply because there are better places out there.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,lolno,-1,10,2/2/2018,"Terrible service. Not the impressive Yum Cha I remembered. We had not enough chairs for our group of 6, no space because the other table had their bags on a chair right next to our table, unable to move back because the tea/cutlery station was next to us. When we told the service staff, she basically gave us zero solutions. Move tables? Nope. Shift ours back? Nope. Tell the other group to move their bags? Nope, she actually said, “what do you want me to do?”. I legit just told you what to do!As if the experience isn’t bad enough, 2 of our ordered items wasn’t keyed in. Felt like I was boiling so much throughout the entire meal I was going to get indigestion. Why am I paying service charge?? I might as well go to a coffee shop jfc. Save yourself the headache and monies and go to Swee Choon instead. This place is going downhill. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,We were underwhelmed,-1,30,01/25/18,"We ate here as a part of a tour, so had a set menu, which may explain our rating. Other diners appeared to be enjoying their food more than we did. The set menu had the usual suspects: a soup, a chicken with sauce dish, a fish with vegies and sauce, pork fried rice, a broccoli dish, and a mango pudding for dessert. The food was not bad, just uninspired, as was the service. I would hope that one could do better in Chinatown in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum lunch,-1,20,01/20/18,"Great service unfortunately matched with bad dim sum. Cold roast, soft spring roll skins, badly done up dumpling soup etc doesn’t justify the 30% higher price there. De Bao Dim Sum at the adjacent street is so much better."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible dim sum and poor value!,-1,10,11/30/17,"I went here after reading the mainly good reviews on TA. I found this place to offer very poor value for money and the dim sums themselves lacked flavour with very small portion sizes and fillings. I mean, I’ve had better dim sum all the way in the U.K. If this place is meant to be one of the better dim sum places in Singapore then I’m afraid you are better of choosing a different cuisine. I spent $20 on three dim sums and a soft drink for myself. Whilst it may seem like good value compared to the U.K., believe me, it isn’t. They make up for it with the size and quality of the dishes. The glutinous rice was a joke. Hardly any filling, the rice was mushy more than glutinous and it was tiny, half the size of a playing card. Much better food around in China Town. Hey, go to the award winning and Michelin Star, Hawker Chan place two minutes walk away where an excellent meal there will set you back $3; yes, three dollars. That just puts things into perspective. Avoid Yum Cha. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,So terrible very bad,-1,10,11/20/17,"We were recommended to go by our hotel concierge. We were very disappointed with the food, and the service the staff could not care less. When ordering for myself, and my husband I wanted vegetarian food this is what we asked for at the hotel. The meal was under the bean curd section but contained pork. When I asked the staff member she just smiled even laughed. I have never eaten meat in my whole life I knew something was wrong. I am so upset, and unwell due to never having meat. If you want a good resurant with vegetarian food don't go. If you want good service don't go, and if you want a good atmosphere don't go. All I can say is don't go"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Cashier’s service / image was a flop,-1,30,10/15/17,"Cashier for that day was unfriendly.We arrived with no staff at the entrance and I went to the counter to ask for a table and she totally ignored me! And when we’re paying the bill,she was totally arrogant!Blessings were the serving staff were great!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Dim sum ok, don't bother with a la carte",-1,20,9/7/2017,We went on a busy bank holiday and were seated within 30mins. Not bad. The dim sum trollers were great and the food was nice. Problem started when we ordered a la carte. The sweet and sour pork was tasteless and sauce very greasy. We wondered if the pork was cooked thoroughly because it had a funny texture. A member of our group vomited after the meal so sure the pork was not cooked properly. The spicy Aubergine hotpot was not spicy and again lots of oil and cornstarch. Don't order a la carte there and stay away from pork.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum breakfast ,-1,30,08/27/17,"It was my first time visiting this restaurant. It is was recommended by my Friend.
Food 7/10
Service 9/10
Ambience 7/10 the place was a bit stuffy
Price 7/10
Overall, it was a good experience. I would recommend to try out swatow or red star."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum!,-1,30,08/13/17,I didn't know what my girlfriend ordered but it was delicious! The best dish was the scallop pea-shoot dumpling.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Poor taste and bad service...,-1,20,8/10/2017,"We were disappointed as we used to come at this place years back and the food, athmosphere and service were much nicer...
Even the table was not stable..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Average food, expensive price, revolting toilets",-1,20,07/29/17,"Food and service ok
Very pricey
Disgusting toilets
You can find better dim sum experience in the area."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was good but food was disappointing,-1,20,7/7/2017,"Visited this place today for their dim sum.. was disappointed as it doesn't taste nice maybe not up to my expectation. The texture and overall was kinda bad.. I read some of the review saying the ha gao and siew mai was nice but it really is not, except of the prawn filling which was fresh. I didn't try the rest of dishes though, maybe will visit another time for the dishes but never coming back for the dim sum."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The quality of the food has dropped by a lot!BBQ,-1,20,06/28/17,"Went to Yum Cha in Chinatown for lunch today with the family. I had tasted good dim sum there before and was expecting more or less the same.Unfortunately, today's lunch of dim sum was anything but nice. The seafood fried rice was tasteless, so was the BBQ Pork Rice Flour Roll.The deep fried dishes of Fried Carrot Cake and Sesame BBQ Pork Pastry were cold. Probably cooked earlier and left on the service counter for too long.Basically, if this is the standard now, I strongly won't recommend anyone to spend your money there."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service average. Food ok,-1,30,06/24/17,"Unable to understand... by adding order, we just need to fill in used paper forms & the service folks will know the difference. They lecture us ""There's no need to inform them"". ... Mmmm???... Super Power! p.s. The extra food filled in the used paper form did not arrive. Ha! wonder why... lolz"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Father's Day ,-1,30,06/18/17,"Came here for Father's Day treat. The 3 basic requirements for a Dim Sum Restaurant are pork dumplings (Xiu Mai), shrimp dumplings (Har Kau) and Braised Chicken Feet (Feng Zhao) to taste the freshness of pork, shrimp and chicken. Had good meals at this restaurant before. Was surprised that the Xiu Mai is still ok but the Feng Zhao is tasteless. Off day for the Chef?"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Horrible,-1,10,06/15/17,"Horrible cheap dim sum with horrible service and dirty ambience.
If you are short of cash and want some dim sum, you can come here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food but below average service :(,-1,30,6/11/2017,"The food is good given the price paid! However, the service staff was unprofessional and rude. They're unwilling to serve and zero smiles on the face. Well, I'm there for the food and to allow my grandma to enjoy so I chose to let it go for the time being."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Questionable Hygiene Standard.,-1,10,05/24/17,"I was at Yum Cha, Chinatown SG, for lunch with my spouse on 23 May 2017. After placing our dim sum order, I proceeded to the washroom at about 12:45 pm to wash my hands as habitual before my meal.In the washroom, I noticed a Yum Cha staff coming out a toilet cubicle and just rinsed his fingers tip quickly at the wash basin next to me. He did not bother to use soap and to wash his hands thoroughly. There was a poster on the wall next to the basins with pics and instructions, apparently for staff, how to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and wash after using the toilet. When he saw me looking at him with disbelief, all he did was smiled and walked out.I am not sure if he handles food there. But with that attitude in my presence as the customer, I wondered what he would do if he was alone with no one watching.Needless to say, I did not enjoy my lunch after that.I always thought Yum Cha served quite good dim sum. Now I have great doubts about the standard of staff discipline and hygiene. Yum Cha?, never again!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese Dim Sum,-1,30,04/30/17,"Variety of Chinese dim sum food to choose from, generally the taste is good however I feel that the food quality has slightly dropped over the years.They offer the trolley service where typically they will prepare popular dishes and wheel them around the dining area, where diners may choose to have as many plates from the trolley service (dish is priced as in the main menu, normally without discount). This might be a good idea if the crowd is large and your order might take awhile to come.Service has been generally good, however waiting time for the staff might be longer if there is a large crowd.Note:The lift has been noted to be spoilt for a long time, unaware if it has been fixed but do not take your chances if a member is not good with stairs. As noted by the other reviews."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special,-1,30,4/1/2017,We love Yum cha and whilst what we had was OK we expected better. Yum Cha in Auckland NZ is a lot lot better quality. As other reviewers have noted the escalator is still not fixed and the entrance to the restaurant is off a side street amidst stalls up a steep flight of stairs.l;The trolleys come around and you can pick what you want. We asked for bar b cue pastries and prawn rice rolls and they came nice and hot. The har gau were OK and we liked the scallop and pea dumpling which was the highlight. We didn't like the Dan (egg) tart too sweet for us and not a good texture. A very busy restaurant with fairly impersonal service. We had to queue for over 10 minutes to pay the bill no idea what they were doing. There are much better YUM Cha restaurants than this one.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum,-1,20,03/28/17,"The restaurant was located at the second floor of the shophouse. Although it was weekday, it was packed with lots of tourists. Menu was a single 2 sided tick list. I was showed to a table by the window. Although there was power under the table, it was not working. So don't plan to charge your hp while eating.Pumpkin Yam Golden Cake ????? (S$4.20++/ 3pcs)The texture was not bad with its crispy top, but it was a tab jelat if having more than a piece and quite oily towards the end. Taste was one dimension.Squid Ink Dumpling ????? (S$4.80++/ 3pcs)The folds wasn't perfect. One piece wasn't even folded in.Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ????? (S$5.20++/ 3pcs)There's holes in the dumplings. I was surprised to find this kind of standard in their signature dumplings.Home-made Almond Tea ??? (S$4.20++)The texture wasn't rich and creamy. It looked kind of like the instant type - sweet and lumpy. Service was spotty. I was told to go to the cashier when I asked for the bill. I could spot customers with their bills served to them at their tables. Also spotted that the next table of Japanese customers had a piece of plastic in his glass of beer. The staff who cleared the glass blamed on the plastic covering the ice cubes, but did not apologize. One could see clearly that the group of customers was clearly upset. Although the customer was later told by another staff that the glass of beer would be waived from the bill, the damage had already been done."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but....",-1,30,03/18/17,"Visited this restaurant ten years ago and had happy memories. This visit found the food much the same. A good selection of yum Cha and mains. Service was adequate and fast. We arrived late morning and by the time we left, about 1.00pm, the tables were mostly taken. Entry to this restaurant can be confusing as the street entrance is hidden under a covered footpath which is crowded by stalls. Walk up a flight of stairs and follow your nose to enter the restaurant. One big complaint is that when my wife went to the restroom she returned saying it was very dirty and she would need to seek another restroom. I visited the gentlemen's and found the same although I managed a successful visit. Some Asian countries are known for poor lavatory management and it was a surprise to find this in a well established restaurant in Chinatown. On the basis of the restrooms, we would not return and recommend only if you have a strong bladder"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not memorable,-1,20,3/11/2017,"Service was not great, and variety is limited....no signature dish to look forward to....elevator was not functioning so my 90 years old father had to climb the tall stairway"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Disappointed, not as good as it used to be...",-1,20,2/11/2017,"Went back here for lunch after first couple of meals here on a previous trip... While ok, it was a disappointment this time, with a vastly reduced Yum Cha menu, most of the common favourites are gone, not to be found... Sad! The place has become a little tired. If you are after great or even good food, don't go here, seek out other options in Singapore. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit of a let down,-1,20,01/23/17,"We are a fan of dimsum having had these since we were young. The typical Chinese dishes you'll see in the Philippines. We also have done a lot of dimsum exploration in HK.Being in the CNY season, we wanted to have dimsum and a walk around Chinatown. Yum Cha is very popular.The ambiance is close to HK dimsum places with the noise, push cart food and most servers speaking only Chinese The food looked authentic. But the taste was far from our expectations. The siomai were the best and that's the only one that got a repeat order. Everything else was just to try and unfortunately, no repeat. To be clear, the dimsum was not bad. Just that the expectations to be the same as authentic HK dimsum was not met.Quite a pricey place too with dished between $4-5 per plate."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special ..,-1,20,01/22/17,I have been brought to this restaurant in Chinatown twice by 2 different tour guides so I assume that it must have been popular and good at one time. However on both occasions the food was a letdown and the ambience very average. So I don't understand why the tour guides keep bringing us here. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch ,-1,30,1/2/2017,Used to visit this restaurant quite often but today is a let down cos both lift and escalator were out of order and my father in law had to struggle to reach the place in second floor . Food still ok but the place is jammed pack . Food served at quick pace though crowded 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,-1,20,12/6/2016,"This is a restaurant I really look forward to going to, however this time it was very disappointing. They charged for the nuts on the table and even for the hand towels. The service was so slow that I had to get up several times and make the waiters come over to our table. The person behind the bill counter was so slow it made me think that she was putting on an act. Food was average and a bit expensive. I ordered a fried rice five times and it took twenty minutes by which time my three year old was hysterical, I ended up having to take it with me. Last time I was here I would have rated it a four at least."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum high tea time,-1,30,12/5/2016,We were on our honeymoon when we visited Singapore in Jan 2015 (can't change the year so have put 2016) and this was our first meal that we had picked prior to coming to the city. It was very highly rated among others in Chinatown so we decided to give it a try. We tried a lot of their dimsum and it was good but I wasn't impressed. Service was also a bit slow so I was little annoyed. Overall i'd say it was an Ok meal.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent choice for dim sum,-1,30,11/12/2016,Tried the main outlet in Chinatown for lunch this week. We had 6 different dim sum options and some porridge - all were pretty good and the service was quite efficient. Not too crowded on a Friday lunchtime so no need for a reservation. Worth another visit.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Enjoyed the High Tea Buffet,-1,30,11/8/2016,"+ eat all you can dimsum and chinese desserts
+ walking distance to Chinatown train station
- pricey at SGD24 per person excluding tax
- can be hard to locate the shop"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice and cheap. Taste wise quite ok,-1,30,11/6/2016,The food is not bad. The price is cheap and with Safra card you get 30% off on weekday evening. The place is average but it's on 2nd level but the elevator is faulty.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious Dim Sum,-1,30,10/4/2016,"Dim sum, Chinese restaurant.Mrt Chainatown Exit AGo straight on Pagoda street until you find T-junction and turn right. Go straight on to intersection. Look at Orange roof. The restaurant is the 2nd floor. Fish Roe Siew Mai (??????), Mango & prawn sesame flitters, Xiao Long BaoRecommend >>> Chinese tea"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food bad service,-1,20,09/17/16,"Lunched at Yum Cha today and while the food was tasty, service was terrible. Seemed only interested in having you eat what was available immediately on the cart rather than ordering anything else - even though on menu."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Dim Sum,-1,30,08/27/16,"Foods were average, location at level 2 easy to find the place
Staff with flat face was servicing us.
The place is good to pit stop for snacking..before you continue your exploration at famous Chinna Town."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special,-1,30,08/22/16,"The price is reasonable. However, food is not fantastic at all. I believe what you pay is what you get. The place is very warm as well despite having fans around."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth traveling to wait in a queue,-1,20,08/14/16,"I don't like to give any poor marks in my reviews, but I can't help it this time.This restaurant has received many good reviews on the Tripadvisor, and was acclaimed for offering good food for reasonable prices in the guidebook we brought. As we stand in line to get a table, I saw people apparently from all over the world as well as locals; my expectations for their food were raised.However, as another reviewer commented, the atmosphere was like a busy factory. It didn't look particularly clean. As we sat at a table, a waitress busily brought us a pot of tea and wet paper napkins along with a menu. What surprised me later was that the tea and the napkins were chargeable; we certainly didn't order them in the first place! The pot of tea turned out to be the most expensive item on the bill at 5.40 SGD.The food quality was okay. As they offered dishes off the pushcart, we didn't bother to look at the menu. The prices of the dishes ranged from 3.80 to 4.80. Some people say their dim sums are of the top quality; I thought they were just above the average. The service charge of 10% was added at the end though I didn't feel we had received any special ""service"" to speak of. After all, you wouldn't be met with much smile at all, and the unasked-for items are charged.Does the total cost of 42.50 SGD for seven dim sum dishes (and tea and towels) sound reasonable? I just don't know.On the way back, we saw many other good-looking, cleaner eateries with smiling wait staff in the China Town. Why not give it a try at another restaurant next time? Would I come back to this restaurant in my future visits to Singapore? Definitely no."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worst experience ever !,-1,10,07/29/16,"Four of us entered the resturant for a meal, we decided the meals were a little too expensive for us so just ordered four entrees and a jug of tiger beer (equals 4 glasses at a cost of $38 for the jug).There were few meals that were reasonably priced but they ranged up to $160 +The staff were so rude we decided to leave, i usually read reviews like mine & think that maybe it is the customer that is the issue as i have never had an experience like this before, we would have stayed & paid the high prices but decided we could not put up with the staff & the fact there was no atmosphere what so ever. We were also brought a small dish of peanuts which we thought were complimentary as with the servettes placed on the table, when paying we were shocked to find a charge of $2 for the peanuts & $1.20 for the servettes, when questioned the lady at the register said it was not much for the peanuts etc, i replied the issue was we were not advised that we were being charged for same.Will not recomend this resturant or go back, ever !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Delicious food, nonsense service",-1,30,07/28/16,"This family favorite place would've gotten 4 stars from me if their service wasn't atrocious. We like coming for the weekday high tea buffet once in awhile because their dim sums are above average and their price is super value for money. We went again yesterday, the 7 of us. It was pretty crowded and though there were many many staff, all of them managed to not see any patrons in the restaurant. And when I did get the attention of one (for maybe some sauce or tea), they would push responsibilities back and fourth to each other until it didn't come, or we get our item after we finished our dumplings. We were rudely told to wait quite a number of times, and a paper literally shoved in my face telling me to ""circle what I wanted"" cuz she couldnt be bothered to listen to and remember my order. We were also told to wait and get things from the push carts even though we ordered after we didn't see the items we wanted on the pushcart. So we waited and nothing came out. There are a TON of things on the menu that you must order because they don't come on the pushcarts. I think they just put the most popular things on the carts and hope you don't order more. But the buffet does promise some 65 items or so. And even then we would order 2 baskets of something (because there are 7 of us) and yet only 1 would arrive. The a la carte service is slightly better, though not a whole rating point better. Service aside, the food is worth coming for, which is why we do."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Rude manager,-1,20,07/26/16,"Food delicious but Manager attitude was terrible.We brought our overseas relatives to lunch at Yum Cha Chinatown Restaurant.We were assigned to the table beside a cabinet which initially we thought is for decoration purpose.Suddenly, a Manager in white polo shirt went to open the cabinet, he didn't tell us to give way. Instead he chase away our elderly guest who was sitting closest to the cabinet without waiting for her to stand up and move. Luckily she did not get hurt from this sudden action.The manager even blamed her for sitting there and blocking his way. Since the restaurant assigned us that particular table and we sat as per their seat arrangement, why are we blamed for sitting next to the cabinet?If this cabinet need to be opened often, why they set the seat just besides it? If due to space constraint, manager should know that this condition is not customer's fault."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Yum Cha,-1,30,07/19/16,Good Yum Cha but can get busy. best times to go - 11am and after 3pm. Seafood is good and tasty. Can order off menu - but need to ask staff - prawns very great. Warning - you have to pay for peanuts and towelettes
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Normal Dimsum,-1,30,06/23/16,"i'm a big fan of Dimsum, but the portion here is small and expensive. Taste average and not worth the money.Not to be picky, but it takes long time for the food to be served.only ate a little bit and the bill was close to SGD 100average is about 4.20 per dim sum with 3 little small pieces of food.don't think will come here againsorry"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,VERY thirsty after eating here,-1,30,06/21/16,"I do not want to make accusations of what ingredients were put in here, but after my tim sum tea break here with my friends, we ALL felt extremely thirsty an hour later. We all suspect that more than just salt was added to make the food all so tasty (and indeed the food was very good). But tasty food should not be due to adding (that particular ingredient) and I am most disappointed. I aint coming back here ANYMORE."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum,-1,30,06/17/16,"Ok,it's basically cantina,no place for business lunch or romantic dinnerVisited for the first time,had dim sums only but they are really ok,and the price is really cheap,what else?Reed some reviews regarding staff and design,frankly-don't careFour off us overeating for the total price off 100 singapore dollars?With good sums,come on.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible Experience,-1,10,6/6/2016,I received a confirmation email from Chope only to go to the restaurant on the day itself to find out that they never received the booking. It was a friend's birthday and there were 10 of us and of course the restaurant was not able to accommodate us. Had to scramble to find another place to go to. Better to call the restaurant directly instead of going through Chope.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Food is nice, service is lousy!!!",-1,30,6/4/2016,The food is nice with lots of variety but the waitress service is really bad. Placing order with smile to them and even by saying thank you but return you are all black face attitude.. Seem that they doesn't welcome you there to eat at all ... Haha
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Mostly consistent food quality, haughty Manager",-1,30,6/2/2016,"For authentic tasting dim sum but served in relatively larger portions, Yum Cha is the place to go. However, our favourite egg tart has suffered a huge drop in standard. It's been served cold and lacks the usual soft fluffy texture and aroma. Otherwise, other usual suspects like siew mai (steamed pork dumplings), har kao (prawn dumpling) and rice dumplings still taste good. Service, however can be improved. Serving crew was obviously overwhelmed but they tried their best to be hospitable. The same cannot be said of the young male manager, however. He was haughty and waved customers away to ask them to wait when he was busy. As a local, guess I am used to this but this may not be entirely pleasant for a tourist curious about local delicacies and can do with some patient serving staff who can explain the wonderful flavours that Yum Cha can offer. In short, go purely for its food and expect nothing from their service. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Another place for fin shark...,-1,20,05/14/16,"The place is like a factory, so busy.Staff have no time to give any attention as they are running all over the place. Very busy.Dim sum are great, tasty but unfortunately one more place that don't give sh... about the shark fin awful trade and offer shark fin dim sum on their menu.Not recommended at all."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing dim sum,-1,20,03/31/16,Popped in here for a quick casual dim sum dinner and left disappointed. The prawn with mango was the the highlight. Friendly staff but significantly inferior to both Spring Court and Yann Palace. Will not return
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good try for foreigners,-1,30,3/11/2016,Worth a try for tourists. Good solid Dim sum with acceptable service. Nice setting and good variety. I enjoyed myself but food is quite heavy.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim sum, so-so service",-1,30,2/3/2016,"The long queue to get in - including many locals, or at least apparently ethnic Chinese people - suggested good things ahead.When we got to our table, tea and Tiger arrived promptly. We ordered in part off the menu and in part from the trolleys. The steamed offerings were good, the fried were a little bland and boring. The wok-fried spinach (with ginger and garlic) was outstanding.Service was, at its best, patchy. Staff seemed run off their feet, and although we were given menus, it took a long time to flag down someone who could take our order. Likewise, the trolley circuit was erratic, and we had to wait for long periods to get attention (and food).The location in Chinatown is great, and the place itself has a pleasing atmosphere.There are better dim sum elsewhere, but Yum Cha is an institution."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Some tasty dimsum, average not great",-1,30,01/26/16,"THE GOOD:Some interesting dim sumCheapTHE NOT SO GOOD:Toilets are disgustingCheung fun blandWe ate here for lunch and the food was okay, nothing special I thought. You need to be aware that if you don't eat peanuts or use the wet towels they will charge you for it.The squid ink dim sum was tasty and was our favourite. Although the cheung fun was very bland and only had two prawns in them. Service was okay, my biggest gripe was the state of the toilets. They were absolutely disgusting. The staff or patrons obviously use it for smoking but not only that, the toilet seat was smeared with brown all over it. Really ruined our visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as good as it used to be,-1,30,1/12/2016,"It was our second visit, The dim sums were mediocre, nothing special. I remembered they used to be better especially the egg tarts. It is conveniently open all day for dim sums though."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good Food, But They Nickle and Dime You",-1,30,12/18/15,"I read something from the Guardian about this place being good so I stopped by here on my trip to Singapore for some dim sum.The food was good, above average even. The Shu Mai were succulent. The bean curd was delicious. I would be giving this place four stars except when I got the bill I noticed they charged me $2 for eating a couple of the little peanuts they put out on the table. They also charged me sixty cents to use the moist towelette on the table. Now maybe this is a cultural thing, but usually if a restaurant puts something out on the table without you asking for it it is a courtesy and you are not charged for it. I was charged nearly as much for a couple of peanuts I thought were free as I was for a dim sum item. This practice feels dishonest and I would recommend the management at Yum Cha discontinues it immediately.I would recommend this place, with the caveat that you shouldn't eat the peanuts and bring your own towelette!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Acceptable Dim Sum,-1,30,11/10/2015,"Visited the outlet near Expo for lunch today. Quite a busy place, but efficient. We had 6 different servings of dim sum and tea for a price of about $35, which seemed like reasonable value. All tasted pretty good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Stick to Din Tai Fung,-1,30,10/4/2015,"When I googled yum cha, this place kept coming up and the reviews were really good. Well I was really shocked that it would be so popular! We queued for a while and even though the restaurant wasn't full, it took a while for someone to take us to a table. We asked for the peanuts to be taken away as didn't want to be charged for something we didn't want. After all, we wanted to save room for delicious dim sum! Well what a disappointment, in a nutshell, they weren't super hot, the dumplings were bland and tasteless and I have had far better in other countries! The restaurant is also really noisy due to the wooden flooring, and we will never return. Din Tai Fung is far cleaner, better service and their dumplings are far more delicious!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good spread of Chinese Dim Sum,-1,30,9/10/2015,"If you'd like a taste of Chinese Dim Sum, try out Yum Cha in Chinatown when you do visit there. You get a good spread of Dim Sum spread on push carts. The quality isn't the best, but it's a good sample spread taste test."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Poor service, below average food",-1,20,8/12/2015,"We found that place because of the ""Singapore Restaurant Month"", where they were supposed to have a special dish, celebrating Singapore's 50 years of independence. Upon arriving, we stood there, waiting to be seated, as it is usual around the city. At least half a dozen waitresses passed us by and none of them even care to address us or even nod. Since the restaurant was not so full, we decided to get a table on our own. Little we know, the bad service was just starting to show.The special dish was in a separate menu over the table, so we decided to order it. The waiter simply told us that we could only order it after 6PM, even though there was absolutely no such information on the website or even at the menu. We then decide to move to the dim sums, as they are supposed to be the house specialty. Granted, some of them were good, but most of them were too greasy, even those that were supposed to be stir fried.The place itself it's also not very clean (on our way out we noticed it received a 'B' grade from hygiene inspectors, which is below many food stalls).Bottom line, if you want a good dim sum around town, you'll be better off with Dim Tai Fung. It's more expensive, but it's also on a completely different level."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Rip off- watch the add ons!,",-1,20,8/3/2015,"Be careful when you dine here. What we thought was a small dish of complimentary peanuts,($2.00!!), and hand wipes, (60cents each),were added to our bill! And a teapot of tea was $3.60!!!Dishes were cheap $2.50-$4.80, but service was terrible. We were given a menu, pencil and ordering sheet to fill out. Food tasted stale. No sign of authentic dishes, eg chicken feet or beef tripe, or porridge, or veggies. Still looking for authentic yum Cha in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible food and shocking service ,-1,10,07/24/15,"We decided we'd like an air conditioned seafood restaurant for my infants comfort and to enjoy a night out with my hubby and the in laws... Upon arrival you are directed to the table, no smiles.. Sit and be prepared to be yelled at. Staff are extremely rude, but they do attend to the table... The way they express them themselves is rather aggressive... Anyway...We ordered a few of their signature dishes... Peking duck is a waste of money, duck was dry, pancakes tiny! Waste of stomach space. We ordered a beef dish, ohhhhhh that was the toughest and piece of meat ever. The other thing that disturbs me whilst try to eat my meal is the constant staring by all staff members .Awkward night out, in terms of food, I would never recommend this to anyone I know. It's not cheap either."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Horrible service by captain.,-1,10,07/21/15,"Came for dimsum but was shocked with waitress foul attitude. Her tone of voice was haughty as though there's no other restaurants we could go for dimsums. We could anytime go to Yan Ting, Peach Blossom, Summer Palace, Asia Grand, Royal China or Spring Court & be welcomed witb open arms & hearty smiles. Even the captain Simon couldnt care less whenever we gave feedbacks to him, he is too aloof as though he was indispensable. Silver Fish had deteriorated a lot over the years, soggy with oil. The skin of Har Kao is thicker than before & hard. Siu Mai had so much fatty pork. Worst of all was the century egg porridge which had only one tiny wee 5mm bit size of century egg & the rest was plain congee. Seriously, this is daylight robbery. Service was lousy & food was terrible yet management was never bothered with customers' constructive feedbacks. Only one chinese female waitress did a great job as she was pleasant, efficient, caring & helpful to our needs. After supporting Yum Cha Gardens since it first opened in Serangoon Gardens, it kicked off with fanfare for 3 years then continually deteriorating till today. Would i recommend, ""no way"" bcos i dont want to lose my reputation for such lousy food & lousy service."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food not fresh,-1,20,06/25/15,"service poor attitude whereas food were not that fresh
ordering was a long awaiting process
prices were not reasonable"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,poor food except peking duck,-1,20,05/31/15,"We went there for dinner and all the food we had was pretty poor, especially the dim sum and the flat rice pancakes, which were impossible to eat. We ordered some glazed beef and the taste wasn't bad but quite tough. The Peking duck was good, though pancakes had a different taste from others I've tried elsewhere. Service was quite annoying because the waiters kept coming every 2 seconds to pour more tea, even if we'd only taken a sip."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Breakfast at Changi City Point outlet,-1,30,05/18/15,Food was served quite fast. Whole restaurant is not that big and currently there is 10% discount for NTUC member for weekend. I would not say that the food is that fantastic. Those fried items were very oily and fried carrot cake is the best. One of the unique item is the squid ink dumpling which is worth trying.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Non existent service and terrible food,-1,10,05/17/15,"Do not bother to come here. Drives you crazy.
The food is not fresh. There is no one that speaks English well. Frustrating. If you sit further in the restaurant, the food trolley never comes to you."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,-1,20,04/19/15,"This restaurant had been recommended , but unfortunately we were not impressed. The restaurant lacked atmosphere and the food, admittedly not dim sum was only average at best. We had looked forward to a meal in Chinatown, but left unimpressed. We also felt that the food was over priced."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service,-1,20,03/14/15,"The staff who served us were unequivocally non-chalent about taking orders. They were only interested in quickly unloading those already cooked and being put on trolleys. They were rude at best.Some of the dim sum was good, but some were tasteless. The fried dishes were cold. I rather spend less at restaurants like crystal jade/ding tai feng and get better food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit disappointed,-1,30,3/1/2015,"My husband and I visited with my brother-in-law and his partner just before Chinese New Year. We had the Hi Tea Buffet.The staff were attentive (but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant anyway). The food was pretty average. I have definitely had better dim sum in other restaurants/countries I have visited and unless you eat absolutely masses the buffet is not brilliant value for money. If you visit you will need to make a decision based on how many big eaters are in your party.I am not a big fish eater. We asked if there was any fish in the steamed carrot cake with cai poh and were told no. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted and I'm guessing from the taste that cai poh is a fish!It was an experience and we enjoyed some of the dishes - particularly the fried chicken in Thai sauce, baked mini egg tarts and chilled mango pudding!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch,-1,10,3/1/2015,"We had lunch at Yum Cha today and every waitress treated us so rudely! Pouring the tea spilling it everywhere, grabbing the plates before we were finished eating - unacceptably rude behaviour when we brought an out of town guest with us. We will never return!! Your food is not that great to put up with this insulting behaviour !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth the hype,-1,30,02/26/15,"Visited Jan 2015 during our Chinatown Night Tour. We had a fixed dinner, starting with herbal rose tea, which was nothing more than rose scented hot water in a kettle. The other items in our dinner menu was ok. Though it was included in our Chinatown tour, the quality and quantity was not fulfilling. But we had a good tour team and we enjoyed our time throughout the tour and this place gave us a chance to sit and talk with each other. The restaurant was somewhat crowded with lots of locals and tourists and it was surely understaffed. Our server picked up our dishes couple of times before we even finish our food, which was not good. Didn't had a chance to order other items from the menu as it was a fixed meal. Lots of other eateries in Chinatown, so this can be skipped unless you're in a tour which includes dinner here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Skip it,-1,20,01/26/15,"Overall this one deserves sad applause, winning no category of service, quality. Cost, taste or ambience. The place is hidden in Chinatown and gives somewhat of an impression that you might find a gem located in the hustle of it all. So up a narrow staircase and excitement brews but alas a big hall, no music and bold bright light. We enter and get pointed to a table fairly promptly and were thinking ""the food should be good since there are a lot of review of the place that speaks to it"". So we rush to call for menus and order too much so we can give a whole bunch of things a try.First comes the vegetables. Vegetarian they say and sprinkled with the usual dose of unnecessary shrimp. Next the fried rice then dumplings etc. dish after dish waiting for something to write home to. Unfortunate I can't say a single one. The service was fairly prompt but never with a smile. The price...hefty for Chinatown. I would carefully reconsider if you want to go here. It's simply not worth it and there are far far better options in Chinatown. Skip it and save yourself the attempt to prove me wrong. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sun Specialist,-1,30,12/22/14,Eficient and friendly service. Good variety of dim sum. Tasty but not surprising. A place where local chinese families go. Over all an interesting experience. Advisable to arrive early as lines can be long.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not Impressed,-1,20,10/24/14,"We dined here recently as part of a group tour of China Town , the food was served promptly, but sadly very bland tasting , in fairness it was set menu and not really to my normal choice ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Only acceptable for novice dim sum eaters,-1,20,09/26/14,"Don't waste your time and money here. Limited selection, poor flavour, very very average. The dim sum you can buy frozen and steam yourself is better than this.On the plus side the service is pretty good, waitress was very attentive and kept my tea topped up. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Mediocre dim sum ,-1,20,6/6/2014,Came here for lunch with my mum and ordered the usual dim sum items like har gow and siew Mai.Sad to say that the standard has dropped. Skin of har gow was one of the thickest I've tried. Taste of the other items are average and pretty saltish.Guess this may be the last time I visit this place considering that there are just too many dim sum joints in Singapore.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Bad service and they steal cameras ,-1,10,05/24/14,"Had such a terrible dinner here I eat a lot of Chinese food all over the world and this by far is the worst I have ever had.The waitresses were so rude and never explained what the food was when they put it down,had to ask for soya sauce. We were on a china town tour.The staff just stand there and stare at you like your a criminal,they refuse to remove dishes it was getting pretty crowded with 8 people at the table. Also when leaving one of the people apart of our group went to the bathroom and on her return her camera had been stolen by a staff member. This is terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the tour.I would never eat here again due to the lack of service and rudeness. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good timsum variety.,-1,30,05/13/14,"Enjoyed the timsum. But in terms of service, it has a lot to be done. Atmosphere can be further improve too."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent,-1,30,03/27/14,"Strategic location in Chinatown, nice name for a restaurant too. The dim sum was nice and the food tasted good. The staff were not as friendly though. Sure it's a crowded restaurant, but smiling when you take someones order makes a difference."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum but watch out for,-1,30,03/19/14,"The dim sum was nice I had (dinner), but charging for the peanuts on the table, charging for the wet towels, leave a Chinese rip off aftertaste.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Yum Cha,-1,30,2/12/2014,"As other reviewers have said this restaurant is not so easy to find. After visiting this place it seems it is targeting the locals. Menu all Chinese, as we were leaving we got an English menu - handy!! Food quite good, plenty of choice and fresh. But didn't have any wow factor at all!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just another place for the casual visitors,-1,20,01/21/14,"The location is good for visitors not knowing very little about Chinese food & culture. People who really like Chinese food would easily find better offerings elsewhere in a lot of food courts and eateries. Service was good though. Definitely not a suitable choice to bring your friends or guests, unless you are really very very hungry and happen to be nearby."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great location. Acceptable Food. Terrible Service. Stressful Ambience,-1,20,01/19/14,"Located right in the heart China Town, this is a great location to bring visitors for a Dim Sum breakfast, but do not expect to be serviced, even though they charge 10% service fees. And be prepared for the noise and crowd of hungry (angry) people - on Sunday morning! We waited for more than 15 minutes without any dim sum trolly passing by, we indicated to the staff three times that we would like to have some dim sum. Unfortunately, all three of them ignore our requests separately. Everyone seems too busy to care or to talk to customers. Finally, after 20 minutes (it seems much longer when you are hungry), one of the trollies with steamed Dim Sum stop by. The lady in-charged of the trolly was attending to two other customers appeared from nowhere, despite acknowledging our existence. We literately have to 'fight' for her attention. There was no vinegar, ginger and soya sauce on the table, we have to grab it elsewhere ourselves. Another interesting thing is being charged for pickle or peanut which was not on the table, and we did not order. We paid S$22 per head for a stressful Sunday morning breakfast. I used to like the food here, but I will give it a miss after this torturious experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you are a dumpling fan - great,-1,30,01/13/14,We went to this restaurant as my friend is a dumpling fan - so it that is you then you will love it. A couple of us who are not so partial to the white saggy testicle like sacks will be disappointed as there was not much else on offer!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent Dim Sum in Chinatown,-1,30,1/12/2014,The dim sum here is decent. I live in New York City where there are several good dim sum restaurants. Yum Cha compares to them.I did appreciate the menu separating the steamed dishes from the fried dishes. The restrooms need to be cleaned. Service is fine.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Terrible, this is",-1,10,12/26/13,"Me and my family had to wait for very long. Toilet is dirty, the supervisor is rude and generally i will not come back again"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average yumcha good service,-1,30,12/25/13,"I visited this restaurant upon recommendation from my taxi driver.i expected a really awesome culinary experience but it was very ordinary.i had prawn wanton which were cold and too appetising, xiao long bao which was already but broke easily not the best and seafood dumplings that were lacking in flavour.i love dim sum so I was disappointed. The meal was reasonable $4 for each choice.it was very Average"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,some yummy dim sum but not as good as Taiwan,-1,30,11/2/2013,"I was disappointed, to be fair, that the promised trolley service was not available on the Friday we visited: weekends only! The long biao xai was good enough and the mixed seafood in green casing really delicious, but some of dumplings were a bit sticky and hard to extract from the steamer. Disappointed not to have any green vegetables at all so the meal is all a bit stodgy. Service good and friendly and the tea was tasty. Having feasted at the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei, it's a hard act to follow!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but not Great,-1,30,11/2/2013,Eating here may be a little intimidating for the non frequent traveller as within 1 minute of sitting down you will be presented with 5 to 7 bowls of food but rear assured this happens to each diner. Be prepared to say No and ask for the menu with pictures and english descriptions.The food was really quite enjoyable and the service was reasonable.There are some odd components though to this place like being billed for nuts that are already on the table and napkins (hand wipe) even though it was only $0.60.Is a real hit with locals though which is always a good sign.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to have your first dim sum experciences,-1,30,10/24/13,nice place to have your first dim sum experiences.the resturant has the same name as the near by hotel and is a bit hidden behind the shops.the quality and kwantity of the food is good. but it lost its charme and the services is poor.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim-sum, but poor service",-1,30,10/17/13,"We can't make reservation to take dim-sum buffet in Jade of Fullerton Hotel.So we went another famous dim-sum restaurant named ""Yum Cha""It is located in temple street of China Town.There's so many people in queue even it's almost end of lunch time.There're many kinds of steamed and fried dim-sum.Most of dim-sum taste good, but service is very poor. We ordered and ordered repeatedly, but our dishes not served fast. So it took so long time to finish our lunch."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A Local Legacy - Good Food - Simple Dining,-1,30,9/12/2013,I have mixed feelings about Yum Cha. I ate there two years ago with friends from the US who were working in Singapore. They raved about the best Dim Sum at Yum Cha so we mad our way to Chinatown upstairs to Yum Cha and had a delightful meal.I returned there a month ago and then took my family last week when we visited Chinatown. Its evident that this is a local establishment that continues to serve very good quality dim sum. I would have given Yum Cha a higher rating if their staff had been a little more gracious rather then just efficient and if the atmosphere was a bit warmer however this is my personal opinion based on my past two visits which were quite different than my first time dining there.If you are in Chinatown its worth checking out although a bit challenging to find the entrance in the shopping arcade.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Thought we were being filmed for a prank,-1,10,8/11/2013,"We went to this restaurant on 10th August as part of a Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour and it was supposed to be a Chinese Dinner......however it was just a joke...the staff were downright rude, the 4 courses of food were put down all the same time from the soup to the mango pudding...they were reluctant to lift dirty plates away....a table of 9 people and no lazy susan to pass the food around which had been ""dumped"" on the table with no explanation.....we also had plastic cutlery and the money for the drinks which were not included in the pre paid trip was demanded whilst we were still eating by a sour faced waitress.....the food was pretty awful, it was bland and also cold when it arrived.......I would not recommend this place....I kept waiting on someone jumping out and saying we had been ""pranked""...just a joke......."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Don't like it,-1,20,07/23/13,"The food was good, my family all agrees with that. but we had to pay for the foods that we didn't even order, and the food came out really late. I think it is because we are foreigners. We also had to pay for peanuts and wet tissue even though they were there at first!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good food, but the service is bad",-1,30,07/21/13,"The food is good,but the service and the ambience is not good at all. We also got the bill without even asking -I guess, the staff wanted to go home."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Steer Clear Of This One!,-1,10,07/20/13,"This is the worst Yum Cha style restaurant I have eaten at in the world. Awful service, awful food and vibe non existent.
Worst meal of my trip this year by far!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Avoid this place,-1,10,6/10/2013,"We been recommend this place by a local guy in the market, the service was very poor, the food average. We were shocked to see the bill- they tryed to charge us $2 for peanuts and $0.80 for each napkins..we refused to pay them for it as they was on the table when we got there and no one told us its not free. I think we got this bad vibe from them only because we not local people."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service :Practice Racism,-1,20,6/8/2013,"Avoid this place if u are Asian .... They don't serve Asian well...we were there sitting at one of tr corner for 10 mins with no one serving us, they kept telling us that dim sum trolleys will come and serve us, but the 2 tables with Caucasians next to us were able to order and they serve the dim sum to their table, well I thought we can do the same but they kept asking us to wait, wait and wait. We asked another waitress if we can order the food instead of waiting the trolley since it took ages for the trolley to serve to the corner we sat, but the other waitress told us to wait too ..... Seem likes this is their management direction n we decided to bring our money somewhere else ..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good staple yum cha or dim sum,-1,30,04/20/13,"WE recently went here for a work lunch. you need to get here before 12pm otherwise the queues are huge and on sunday, this restaurant is very popular so get there early. Its very good for basic yum cha/dim sum - steamed dumplings, wantons, spring rolls, rice rolls, congee and rice and noodles. The service is ""brisk"" and its pretty cheap and cheerful kind of place with less of the ""cheap"". It is moderately expensive for what it provides."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,spkendid,-1,30,04/19/13,"nice food, nice staffm best tastying saudies and ummy burgers tuna was fish but coconut was runny, Squid was tough but waiters nice and chummy."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,terrible service; fair food,-1,10,4/10/2013,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel (Conrad Centennial) and was also in the DK Eyewitness Travel Book. I asked for a table by the window and they said it was for a larger group; but then they sat two people there. We had a variety of waitresses, all of whom could care less. Ordered a springroll, bok choy, and duck. they first brought the bok choy, much later the spring roll, and fianlly the duck. The quality of the food was good but the service was abominable, and the order of the food was really strange. At the end of the meal when we received the check they charged us for the handiwipes (they never gave us napkins) and for nuts on the table that we never ate. All in all, a big disappointment and really poor service with an attitude."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just not the warm friendly Singapore we know and love,-1,10,03/22/13,"From the moment we entered the staff were sour and certainly far from sweet. No help was offered ordering and when the bland dull food arrived we had to ask for bowls which were ceremoniously dumped still stacked on the table, how a place like this exists I do not know, maybe they just don't like foreigners and are happy to rely on local trade, most certainly would never go back or in deed recommend."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fast and good,-1,30,02/16/13,Upstairs in a corner in Chinatown. A mix of Chinese and tourist diners so they are doing something right. The food is good enough. Not amazing but hits the spot. Nothing in Singapore is cheap (except the trains) and this place is no exception.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Would hv rated as 'Excellent' if not for captain Zhou Ling,-1,30,1/1/2013,"I had to wait for my eldest daughter to return from Melbourne before visitng Yum Cha again bcos she loves dim sum alot. So, together with my family I bought along my mother to sup before 2013 appears. We found new dishes eg chocolate pretzel sticks which are Pork Springrolls, the very colorful Baked Cheese Seafood tarts & the Chive Dumpling. They are good, give them a try. Our fav & Best dishes are still the Durian dumpling (moochi), Beijing Duck, Crispy Red Bean paste wt Banana pancake, Century Egg congee, siu mai, har kao, phoenix claws, carrot cake, etc. One particular dish that seem to drop standard is the Char Siu chee cheong fun which used to have thinner & softer skin. A standing ovation we would give to is waitress Ms Leong Lai Chee for her excellent service & beautiful waiting attitude. She carried out her duties without any flaws but full of our praises and profesionally done. Our cups were continually filled up without having to remind her at any moment, hats off to her. She cleared our used plates promptly & timely and replenished with new ones efficiently and courteously, everytime with a genuine smile on her face. The climax was when she efficiently served us the Beijing Duck with such promptness. She made our lunch a great JOY indeed. I was very disappointed with the Captain who first attended to us when we stepped in, Ms Zhou Ling despite only 3 tables in the hall at the point we were seated. She seemed to display both in action and vocal tone that she's either serving us out of obligation or out of reluctance. Her physical gestures combined with her facial expresssions and her sarcastic tone of voice when she answered our enquiries or during serving us were congruent to poor service as a Captain. We felt we were not welcomed, if not for Ms Leong & subsequently for Captain Ivy Lim's presence. Halfway through our feasting, Captain Ivy Lim replaced Zhou Ling (we dont know for what reasons). She was bubbly and excited to see us dining as a family. In fact, with her presence she brighten up our dining experience with her resourcefulness and cheerfulness, unlike Zhou Ling's lethargic & unwelcoming body language. Next, is our praises to aunty Ong Ah Choo, who never failed deliver dishes with a good-feeling attitude and genuine smile everytime we dined here, countless times already. This is the real 'unsung heroine' whom many customers take for granted and would never mention good of her to management. Such is the character that made my family want to come back again and again besides the cosy clean ambience, the good food and the correct pricing. One of the very best take away we would buy home is the sambal belachan. Die die must try. My family reckons and votes this to be the very best in the whole of Singapore. Kudos to the chef."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Avoid this place!,-1,10,11/22/12,"Terrible service, food without taste and very rude crew. Be careful! They even charge for the napkins. And if when you sit on the table, they offer you complementary pickles, don't accept it. They will charge you in the end without warning."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Bad night,-1,10,11/22/12,"After reading the reviews of Trip Advisor me and my boyfriend decided to go to Yum Cha Restaurant.What we thought it would be a plesant dinner end it up being a headache.My boyfriend order the lobster but never specified the weight of it. The waitress decided by herself. Then when the bill came, we had to pay too much money for an average meal.The bill also included the peanuts that we never order and the hand towels that another waitress gave me when I asked for napkins. Unbelieveble..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good food, horrible service, filthiest bathrooms I've ever seen",-1,20,11/6/2012,"How to rate this place I wonder. The food we ended up ordering was good but the road to getting there was not without hassle. Due to non-smiling, no english speaking, non-personal and frankly non-caring about anything or anyone staff at this place you are on your own figuring out the menu. If you would know what to get it wouldn't be a problem and you just don't give a crap about the horrible, unhelpful service. Unfortunately, we were without help and ended up with a bit of a strange menu mix of dim sums. True, they were good but I feel it could have been so much better. Only go here with advice or knowing your stuff and you'll have an awesome lunch/dinner. Otherwise avoid it because you'll leave the place not feeling totally satisfied and there is no need for that in this part of town."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A good dim sum place,-1,30,11/5/2012,"Yum Cha is your usual dim sum place. It's pretty good quality, but not exceptional. They didn't have cheong fun when we visited, which was a disappointment."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Average food, sullen waitresses",-1,30,10/6/2012,"The dim sum was pretty average - nowhere near the Crystal Jade standard. Restaurant has a quaint chinatown location, but the waitresses were pretty unfriendly and some even quite rude. I wouldn't go back there."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is good but service is unpredictable,-1,30,09/22/12,"I've been patronising here since its inception when our favorite Jumbo Restaurant left Serangoon Gardens Country Club. The ambience is grand wt high ceilings & spacious. Very good for inviting guests & family gatherings. Food is good but slightly on the pricey side. Dim Sums are good and lots of variety to choose from either order through waiters or pick from the push-carts. Seafood is presentable and nice but the crabs may not be always packed and meaty unlike No Signboard Restaurant which never fails to serve good quality meaty packed crabs. Service can be unpredictable & depends on your luck. Our first few visits were unfortunate to have this one female supervisor, Mag, who was blatantly rude, unprofessional & ill-treating us & other neighboring tables too. I feedbacked to Simon, the manager, but he coudln't do much to improve. At times, we had an excellent supervisor named John but sadly he has left after our 6th visit. Simon is stll there and he still behaves with an indifferent attitude, one ear in one ear out. Occasionally, the waiting time for our dishes was late and delayed despite several reminders. I reckon Simon needs to improve his attitude to serve diners with a heart and not just as a manager title. I find the elderly aunties who serve dishes are nicer, more pleasant, courteous and friendlier than the supervisors or Simon. With UOB cards there's discount.I normally hold celebrations like birthdays, Mothers Day, reunions, gatherings in this place due to its proximity to my house. Oyes, parking is ample and can be valet too. Sad to say, the standards have dropped through the years. Also because the management are not willing to listen to genuine feedbacks from their loyal & faithful supporters. Seems to play hard to reach giving the impression of aloofness & cold."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Popularity forces us to downgrade our rating,-1,30,08/31/12,"I used to be a big fan of Yum Cha. However, it has grown in popularity so much that (1) there is always a wait for a table, (2) the staff are overwelmed and getting a waitress' attention is a struggle, (3) because of the full tables, it is hard for the ""dim sum"" carts to move between tables, meaning that it is hard to get food, (4) it is very noisy, and (5) trying to pay one's bill takes a long time. Our trip there for lunch last Saturday was just not fun. I also noticed that food quality has gone down and prices have inched up. I recommend going to one of the many other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood -- after all, all Chinese food is about the same: lots of sauces and MSG."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Is this as good as it gets in Singapore?,-1,20,06/23/12,"So we are Yum Cha fanatics and were excited to be in a largely Chinese city with the opportunity to indulge ourselves. We were very disappointed. The restaurant was ok the service was not bad but the food was mush. Poor fillings, tasteless dumplings and weak sauces. If you have Yum Cha regularly in either London or Melbourne dont bother coming here. Trip Advisor is usually very good for recomendations but not his time."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but good enough",-1,30,06/14/12,"It is a good restaurant, descent food, good service, and great location. I wouldn't say this is the best dim sum, it is worth a try and pretty famous in Singapore. It is crowded during meals peak hour so reservation is suggested."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worth a try,-1,30,6/11/2012,"The dimsum variation quite alot, and it taste great! The prawn is freshly made, and there are some new variation of dimsum that you cant find somewhere else. However, the service is not so good. Alot of customers yet so little waiter around. Anyway you can view some photos in my blog, cassijes.blogspot.com : D"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Honest food,-1,30,6/10/2012,"Nested upstairs in Chinatown, no problem withe the range and flavor of the food but there isn't much joy /personality from the staff and the ambience is light compared to other places in the area. Pricing suggests more work needed on these points."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average only but authentic +,-1,30,1/11/2012,I can only compare this to the yum cha back home in Melbourne.I found this place upstairs in a street off Temple St in middle of Chinatown. Poorly signposted and had to ask local shopkeeper for directions.Came for lunch on weekday and there was a photo description menu rather than wheeled trollies which made it easy to order but less interesting.The yum cha was standard rather than inspiring. Tasty+ Would like to try Yum Cha elsewhere in Singapore before rushing back.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Standards have dropped,-1,20,12/31/11,"Had brunch here, restaurant was crowded, service was slow and rather apathetic. Dim sum was cold, overall standard of food has dropped. And do remember to check your final bill as they overcharged me by $15"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One manageress spoilt our dining experience.,-1,30,07/30/11,"Dined here several times & had enjoyed most of the time except for this particular manageress, Madalene, who was rude to the core & deliberately pick a fight with customers.Without the ugly encounter with her, I would have rated this restauarant as ""Excellent"". Apparently, when we returned next round the management did nothing to her even after giving valuable feedbacks. Otherwise, i find the food 'great', waiting service by other staff 'good', ambience 'very spacious & high ceilings', price is on the high end. Would i go back, the ugly encounter is a phobia unless the management take actions on Madalene's rotten attitude."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service but delicious meal,-1,30,07/17/10,"We went here on our last day in Singapore. We were staying in Chinatown and wanted something from a restaurant so we could sit down. Service was absolutely shocking.They use a button system where you push a button when you are ready to order, want more water or want the bill. Good luck getting them at any other time. And my waitress was very cranky and spoke no english whatsoever. But.... our meal was good. Sizzling beef and sweet and sour pork, rice and chinese tea came to around $45 sgd, not cheap for chinatown but the food was tasty. Pity about everything else though"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,It was better.,-1,20,03/21/10,It was better.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"They have nice char siew paus but overall, it was average.",-1,30,12/26/09,"They have nice char siew paus but overall, it was average."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,shocking,-1,10,07/25/09,went to yum cha restaurant in singapore for the first time in ages for yum cha and was sooo dissapointed. the trolleys didn't even make the efforft to come to our table. we had to keep asking for more food. they weren't THAT busy...surely they would want to try to make more money???
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,expensive.,-1,30,1/12/2009,expensive.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Will Not Try Again,-1,20,10/25/08,Food wasn't the greatest. We've had more authentic dim sum in LA.Service was ok. The hostess needs some attitude adjustment.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"too much msg in the food, cause the group was really thirsty afterwards. otherwise the pushcarts added to the whole dim...",-1,30,10/16/08,"too much msg in the food, cause the group was really thirsty afterwards. otherwise the pushcarts added to the whole dim sum experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chefs must be on leave ,-1,20,05/29/18,"I have been a regular customer and bringing overseas guests there or the one at East Coast.Having eaten black pepper and chilli crabs, i decided to try something different; saltes egg cream. It was disastrous. I expect it to be creamy but instead it's dry. The crab meat was harden and shrunk as it was over fried. They even had the skin to charge more for the preparation. The roast duck was not completely cooked with raw bloody flesh at bone. We were told that a new sercing will be prepared but we were presented with a steamed roast duck that tasted like a overnight dish. The vegi dish was no better than a coffee shop zicar. My guess is that the chefs must be on leave that evening and all the dishes were prepared by trainees. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for its chilli & pepper crab,-1,30,04/28/18,"We came here for supper at 11pm to try their famous chilli crab and black pepper crab. If flavour in both sauce are quite distinct:Black pepper crab- very strong pepper taste, so much so it is quick spicy with a very peppery after taste. And quite salty. It’s a dry “sauce”. Chilli crab- half the pot is the sauce/gravy. It a sweet/spicy chilli sauce.If you love the taste of the “sweetness” of crabs on its own. Unfortunately for you, the sauces are very overpowering and kills the taste of the crab. But if you do not like crabs, you will actually enjoy them for a change because the sauce kills the taste of the crab.This is the only place in Singapore that I have tried the chilli crabs so I have nothing to compare. But having love to eat crabs, it is not to my liking. Apparently the place can get quite busy during peak hours (aka dinner). We came at 11pm, so it was a lot quieter and hence our dishes came out within 10mins. Usually it would take 30mins when it is really busy. Our waitress (the Phillipino lady) who took our order was wonderful and friendly. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not our way of eating crab ? ,-1,30,04/28/18,"Located in Dempsey Hill just opposite the Botanical garden . Good atmosphere . Indoor and outdoor seating Service staffs are friendly and efficient . Even though she warn us the crab will take 30 minutes to cook we got the dishes at 15 min but then again we went at 10.30 pm Black pepper crab was charged at $88 kilo . It has overpowering peppery taste and very salty . Chillie crab was charged same at $88 per kilo . It has sweet sauce with touch of lemongrass , onion garlic and lemon . Nice sauce to go with dumpling Frankly the peppery and chillie sauce killed the sweet taste of crab "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Busy Restaurant famed for its seafood - Staff stressed!,-1,30,04/25/18,I ate here with a colleague as was told it was the best pepper Crab in Singapore. the restaurant is very busy and staff looked stressed. We had booked a table but still had to stand in a queue to get a table. No eye contact from the receptionist and staff were mostly unhelpful. they need to work on customer service. The Pepper Crab was good but not up to House of Crab in Colombo.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Horrible experience,-1,10,03/28/18,"Just finished dinner at Long Beach Dempsey with my brother and his family who are visiting from out of town — and I will never go back there again! Although I made a reservation for 730pm, we had to wait for a table and we weren’t seated until almost 8pm. The food was mediocre at best. The razor clams were overcooked (and overpriced) with more minced garlic than clams. The house specially prawns were disappointing as were the house specialty tofu. However the worst part of the experience was that our Chili crab (the main reason we were there in the first place) never showed up! We had finished all the other dishes and waited over 30min. We reminded a wait staff, then after a while reminded another. We were then told the kitchen dropped one of the crab claws and had to prepare a new dish! Whilst the wait staff tried their best, they were clearly overworked, understaffed and not trained for any ‘service recovery.’ I will not be going back there again! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just ok,-1,30,03/28/18,"Just an ok experience - didn't have a record of our reservation when we arrived, seated us at a table that was essentially in a stair well, and food was just ok. Deep fried baby octopus was not good, will be going to Jumbo for those in future. Pepper crab and chili crab good, noodles just ok. Disappointing experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No wifi,-1,10,03/19/18,Not a kid friendly place. Not willing to share their wifi with customers so my kid can play some games and keep himself occupied. Disappointing!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very crowded place and food was so-so,-1,30,3/9/2018,"Was brought here by a local friend who swears by the Alaskan crab here. The Alaskan crab was good (though very expensive) but the rest of the dishes were a complete let-down. Food in Malaysia is better (and cheaper!!). Sprawling place with lots of rooms around and it just had a strange atmosphere. It was very crowded but it just felt a bit claustrophobic rather than lively, and service was very hit and miss. If you're stuck in one of the rooms at the back (which we were), then you sometimes had to go out to get the waitstaff to refill your tea as they don't come by other than to serve your food. I wouldn't recommend it. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper crab,-1,30,12/14/17,"We were told by locals to go and try black pepper crab at this restaurant. We did. The service was good. They even took out the meat from the crab for you. However the most important thing about food is the ingredients. The crab is not great at all. They give you mud crabs which are tasteless. Therefore black pepper, which you can order for hotter or less hot, is the only taste you get from this dish. And the razor cram was overcooked. So all in all the lunch was not so good as expected and it was expensive too. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not bad,-1,30,10/21/17,"Came here on our last night in Singapore. We wanted to try their black pepper crab. They have a few set banquet which of course all feature either black pepper or chili crab. We've picked one with razor clams (was excellent) and lala rice noodle (I've read that's good). There were quite a few tables around us but somehow everyone's food came before we did.The waitress did warn us that the normal crabs they had at the time were a bit small so was expected that. However, we were a bit disappointed with the black pepper crab. Didn't find the taste that great.We then ordered another type of crab (Scottish wild crab) and cooked it with chili, this dish was excellent. The crab was sweet and the chili sauce was very fragrant. Perfect to dish the fried buns in.The meal was not cheap but at least we had a few good dishes."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average for Singapore but a little pricy,-1,30,10/15/17,"Food was fine in my opinion standard fare for Singapore and 8 of us eating but still hurt a bit when I picked up the bill. Charging for the wet towels was cheeky considering gwe ordered and paid for prawns and two crab. Tried to order the crispy duck but a CA's eof sorry sold out which is also a fail in my book. If passing would probably go back but wouldn't bother to make the trip from downtown again, food from a hawker centre as good or better. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR NAPKINS,-1,10,10/12/2017,lol what a joke. You have to pay for the wet napkins that they give you. Crab is messy what do they expect you to do? Use the table cloths?? My boyfriend and I got a bad first impression since they were pushing the most expensive items on us and rushing us to order we should have known better. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ok ,-1,30,10/4/2017,"Not a bad place if you want to enjoy Chinese seafood in Singapore . This place is very popular with tourists, locals and a favorite place to entertain business visitors to Singapore. Overrated.Pricey, but so is everything else in Singapore. There are many other places equally good if not better and cheaper."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Overrated - you can find better for less,-1,30,09/13/17,"Our friends had gone here and recommended it and so we booked through the concierge at our hotel who told us it was upscale casual. It's casual casual with slippers and t-shirts. It's the kind of restaurant that they place food on your table that you haven't ordered and will charge you for it unless you say something. We ordered the chilli crab, med order of prawns, med order of noodles, vegetables and 4 beers and it came to $240 singapore dollars. There is however a restaurant 5 minutes walk away called the Red Dot that has great live music and a good vibe!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Overpriced,-1,30,08/14/17,"Extremely expensive meal. They were full indoors so we had to seat outdoors, but it was extremely hot and stuffy. We did not enjoy the dining experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Too much MSG,-1,10,05/24/17,"Very long wait for the order.Too much MSG in the cooking.We came as a party of 12, waited for over 45mins for the 1st dish. The dishes came 1 by 1 and 2 dishes we ordered were not available , also they ran out of fresh coconuts.Either to say we were very disappointed by the whole experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long beach Authentic Pepper Crab,-1,30,5/4/2017,Went to Long Beach for Chili crab with a group of 6 friends. The food was good but despite our best efforts the language barrier worked as a disadvantage. We asked several times how many crabs we would get and never were able to understand the answer. Food came out very slowly and one dish at a time to be split between 6 of us. When the crab finally came it was maybe one to 2 crabs torn up in a very soupy stew. Very much wok for very little crab meat. Communication was never adequate and we were stuck entertaining our friends as per how the restaurant wanted to serve us. We had to ask several times for napkins. Not Singapore's best. No offer of bread or rice was ever made / to enjoy the gravy with. But the Tiger Beer women come by frequently.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average Chinese meal,-1,30,02/27/17,Lacks a bit of flavour. Good wasabi prawns. Chillie Crab was average have eaten better. Razor clams were good. Good tea.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good alternative destination to the East Coast,-1,30,12/15/16,I patronize this branch a few times during a calendar year and food and service quality has remained consistent though it does falter when it is especially crowded. Good plus is free parking at Dempsey.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Terrible, food is crap",-1,10,12/4/2016,"Everything tasted terrible. You get better taste in any coffee shop. Some dishes were just weird - bitter, too salty... The only thing passable was prawns - which were boiled."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,not a good experience,-1,10,11/21/16,"Made a reservation for a business group but we were seated under a fan at dusk with bright lights which attracted all sorts of bugs and we could not keep them out of our hair or drinks and so we abandoned all thought of eating here, also they offered one price for locals and a far higher price for non-locals and so would never return here again"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A terrible but expensive dinner,-1,10,10/31/16,"We read the previous reviews & were looking forward to dining here. What a disappointment. The restaurant is very tired looking with dowdy tablecloths, no napkins provided, plastic plates and some of the worst wait staff we have ever experienced. We chose a 5 course set menu for 4 of us and dishes were plonked down on the table in rapid succession, regardless of whether we had finished a course or not. The miserable waitress splashed us with sauces as she dished up & we had to use the tablecloth to cover our clothes as best we could. The food was poorly presented and whilst the razor clams and pepper crab were tasty, the rest of it was bland and tasteless. They rushed us through all 5 courses within 45 minutes. This was truely the worst dinner we have ever experienced. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place for Business dinner,-1,30,9/6/2016,"Good and convenient location near Orchard area. Nice environment away from the city with ample parking spaces. The place is crowded even during weekdays because of business dinners. If you plan to dine here advance booking is highly recommended.Food wise it is nothing to shout about. We had the usual chilli and pepper crab and tasted just like those in other restaurants. If you like the chilli gravy to dip the fried buns in, the chilli crab does come with a lot of gravy. Taste of steam fish is over powered by the spicy sauce. Sauce of the clam dish tasted just like that of chilli crab even though the waitress said it has sambal added. The silver fish fried rice was good though; very well fried with a little bit of crunch from the silver fish.Service was good even though you could tell they were struggling to manage. You can see diners getting impatient waiting for their dessert and bills toward the end of the night.Overall a good place for a business dinner but not for a family meal where you expect something special."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good service, food was very good but pricey for such a casual restaurant",-1,30,08/21/16,Service very good and being new to the local seafood scene lots of help with ordering and recommendations. Chili and pepper crab very good as were the razor clams. Only observation is that is really is a very casual dining experience but at a high price point. Mainly catering to the expat and tourist crowd so lacked that local feel.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fun for overseas guests,-1,30,08/13/16,"Long beach has many branches but this one at Dempsey is my favourite. Easy parking, huge with lots of private rooms. Seafood here always fresh and great place for overseas guests who wanna try chilli crab or pepper crab!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Desapointing,-1,20,07/28/16,If you want to be sad about how to degrade a decent lobster go there. Only the black peper crab is interresting . Service is at rush and place has no interrest . One time largely enough .
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood dinner with friends,-1,30,07/27/16,Open restaurant with private dining rooms available. Food is good and delightful. Winelist is rather limited. Service is above average.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Uneven night for service and food,-1,30,06/30/16,"We dined on a Tuesday night but it felt like a weekend since all the tables were full and the place was very busy. We had some issues at the start with a server who didn`t understand English was was quite surprising since the place is so busy with ex-pats and foreign visitors. We tried many dishes and some were great - the Scottsh razor clams, Black Pepper and Chilli crab for example. Others like the steamed fish and prawns were fairly average. The steamed fish had been cut up away from the table and seemed to have been a rushed job since it full of bones. Service was slow throughout the night which was a little understandable with it being so busy. Overall pleasant evening but nothing to get over excited about."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Messy Dinner,-1,30,06/13/16,"Great place to experience the Singaporean cuisine away from the touristy track. We ordered the chilli Crab, amongst other specialties. The food was excellent but for some reason they are stingy on the hand towels for such a messy meal. It's well priced"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Too famous.,-1,30,5/2/2016,"So busy we hardly saw our waiter, and they had no time to explain things on the menu. Just told us what we should order. The chili sauce was too sweet for me, and the crabs we got had no roe or innards of any kind, so they were missing the best part. Way expensive for what you get."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,If it's chilli crab you want...,-1,30,04/16/16,"..this is the place. I'm not a big fan of spicy food but the crab, fish and seafood we ate here was very tasty. Only downside is it's messy eating and lack of napkins so up and down to wash hands. Service was a little slow at times. Beer by the pitcher was good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not greqt,-1,30,4/9/2016,"Friday night out with business colleagues. Food was good, not great. Service was just ok......prefer Jumbo Seafood, waitress not as helpful as we would have expected, but still overall fair to good experience. Don't think I will go back to this location.....just too many good rests in Singapore that act like they want my business!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper crab,-1,30,03/28/16,"Good tofu, great pepper crab, but make sure they take the crab meat out of the shell because they will do a better cleaner job than you can! Get a table in front of the crab tanks for atmosphere. The rooms on the far side are lifeless and AC is too cold. Parking is easy outside. Im not sure the set menu is good value, we felt quite hussled into ordering it. Service is excellent."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dated!,-1,10,03/13/16,1st bottle of wine....not available....2nd not also...third time lucky. All the plastic chairs are dirty. Not what I expected from an apparently first class seafood restaurant. Very dated.....the people who own this restaurant need to think about the mouse analogy. Going back for the same piece of cheese that is not there. Could be so much better. Absolute rip off. Ordered a margarita and it was pathetic! How much do you want to cheat people. Great setting.....but crap.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Expensive Tourist Trap,-1,20,3/8/2016,"We hope this place is merely resting on past laurels, and hasn’t always served food this undistinguished and pricey. It’s not that the quality of the food is bad - it’s fresh seafood after all so how badly can you mangle it? — but the prices are stratospheric and the portions small. The pepper crab is the signature dish and for $50 for a medium portion, there was not much of it. (It’s brought from Sri Lanka.) A small side dish of a few pieces of broccoli was $12. The ambience is nothing special - a bit chaotic actually (which wouldn’t have bothered us if the food were more memorable). It seems to attract wealthy residents and people on expense accounts (for whom $200/four not including alcohol is normal) and tourists - who think they’re going to get something special (that was us). Give it a miss. There is much better food to be had in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A bit too expensive,-1,30,2/4/2016,A crowded restaurant with a few branches in Singapore. Famous for their crabs. The famous chili crab is abit too spicy. Slight expensive
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great disappointment ,-1,30,01/30/16,"I was looking forward to a great meal but was utterly disappointed. Lohei was not nice. The baby abalone, in place of salmon,tasted fishy. The bamboo clams were ok. The cereal baby lobsters were a bit too salty. The black pepper crab were too spicy. The clams were to appetizing. The fried rice tasted bland. Only saving grace was the dessert. I don't know what happen to them. Last year, I was still enjoying. Even their fried rice were tasty. It's a great disappointment for a place so well known and so pricey, "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big disappointment,-1,20,01/18/16,"I was looking forward to try the black pepper crab and chilli crab as it was recommended to definitely try in singapore. My boyfriend was looking on tripadvisor and we wanted to go to the main restaurant but there was no table, our concierge recommended another closer to the hotel, but same company, so we booked. First of all they wanted to sit us, at the washing area, looked horrible, smelled bad, obviously I told them Im not gonna sit there...The restaurant is not cheap, and I was ready to pay for excellent food, and restaurant, but not on plastic chairs, watching the dishwashers gumboots and the cleaning process during my dinner. Not to mention, we dressed up nicely. They asked us to wait, the lady was not really helpful, after 10min we got a nice table. I was ready to forget the bad start, but.. The staff was NOT kind at all, it was around 8:30 pm, felt like they want to go home so much, waiting for the shift to finish. Nobody spoke proper english, at least those who were in contact with us. The crab was ok, but nothing amasing. At the end we paid about 150 EUR for 2 pax ( dinner and drink). Did not worse the money"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not so good anymore,-1,30,1/3/2016,"Must have when in Singapore, Chilli Crab.Jumbo is fully reserved one week ahead, so no choice, we have to settle for Long Beach. This is our second time here after a year.We book table inside (Aircond) but when arrived was told no table inside so have to sit non Aircond table outside. Since they are packed all the time, its take it or leave it.As tourist, well, we have no choice!We order Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Fried Kangkung.Chilli Crab is good but not as good as before. Standard has drop. Black Pepper Crab is spicy but nice. Well, the meal cost SGD 305 (with GST) inclusive of Chinese tea and desserts, rather expensive! But it satisfied our Chilli Crab crave :-)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Singapore seafood in informal setting,-1,30,10/2/2015,"Came here at the suggestion of local friends to taste chilli crab. It was good, but not great. Better the pepper crab. Both priced at SGD 72. Also interesting is the razor clam, huge but overpriced at SGD 16 EACH. With some house prawns (SGD 30) and some side dishes, plus 5 Tiger beer, the bill was SGD 400, IMHO a bit excessive considering the cheap setting, paper napkins and basic level of service.Be careful not to take a table at the far end of the terrace or you might end up spending the evening listening to the karaoke next door..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,yummy crab,-1,30,08/22/15,"it's my 2nd time visiting long beach. the restaurant here is not as fancy as the one in east coast. but the pepper grab is still star of the whole meal. crab is large and with lots of fresh meats. it cooks perfectly with super matches with pepper.mango dessert is another icon of this restaurant, but more on visual effect than flavor itself. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worst service in history,-1,10,07/28/15,"Wow, expected a lot based on reviews. Place is 100% packed, but service is very poor. We waited and waited for service. Not coming back, ever. Need to at least be friendly, maybe because we are western family? Sorry for coming here, what a let down. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Some tasty dishes, but difficult for a gluten-free diner",-1,30,05/20/15,I have celiac disease and wasn't able to get clear explanations of which dishes are gluten-free or can be prepared that way. I took my chances on chili crab (the server said it had no soy sauce) and greatly enjoyed it. I didn't find much else I could safely eat.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not a Nice Experience,-1,10,5/12/2015,When we arrived we stood around to be seated and no one seemed very interested. We were put at a table at the entrance which was windy and unpleasant. The service was shocking. Our food was cold and not at all pleasant. Onto the bill they added extra costs for the peanuts that were on the table and 2 dollars each for paper serviettes. It really was a dreadful experience after having been recommended to us.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Ok food and service, lousy beer lady",-1,30,04/21/15,"We had 3 tables of 10 and ordered a set dinner. The giant clams, pepper crabs and roast chicken were good. Fish, fried rice and mango dessert were ok. Service is mostly fine too. Like some restaurants and coffee shops, the beer is outsourced to a 3rd party and you have these grouchy ladies hawking and serving beer. Near the end of our dinner we stopped the flow of beer which kept coming, since these ladies probably earn commission. Despite our stop instructions , they kept giving us jugs of beer and refused to take them back. Rather annoying. Before we got the bill, we had to speak to the manager to cancel the untouched jugs"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood Haven,-1,30,11/25/14,"hi i was dragged by my friends here at Long Beach dempsey hill last September...enjoyed the Chili Crab and the freshness of Lobsters..if you feel bored on weekends and feel like eating anything from the sea., Long Beach is the best place at Dempsey Hill..Well Done"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,over the top,-1,30,11/19/14,"Drunken prawns in a herbal soup broth and bamboo calms is to die for. The warm herbal broth was delicious,. I strongly recommend this to any first-time diners to Long Beach! Disappointed with long beach's seafood at Dempsey. Somehow i think the outlet at east coast is better. The chilli crabs we had didn't seem very fresh, and the sauce was all watery. Black pepper crab was the star of the night. It seems like its targeting more for tourists, Service is so so, fish soup, yes it taste good but very expense.For a restaurant that pride itself with seafood and crab.The crab meat was not firm at all and its claw meat was not body fill,for the price we paid it was robbery on Dempsey road."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Peppered Crab, signature dish?",-1,30,11/18/14,"We had black peppered crab of which the black pepper was so overpowering that we could only feel the texture of the crab meat but not its freshness. The fried clams was only fried with black bean sauce which gave it a monotonous taste. Normally,clams are fried with black beans and chilies to give it some layering in the taste. However, the restaurant was still jammed packed with local families and expatriates. I think people go there for reminiscences on good time with families and friends more than for the taste of the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs need to be improved!,-1,30,11/4/2014,"Went there for both chilli and pepper crabs. Chilli crabs taste good but pepper crabs are disappointing! It is too oily and wet! Need to review this dish or it is losing customers to Jumbo! In fact, I brought a group of six last week to Jumbo instead of Long Beach!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Disappointment with the ""new Menu C"".",-1,30,10/28/14,"I decided to celebrate a birthday at this venue and selected their “newly created dishes menu, ” Set Menu C. This entitled me and my guests to a private dining room.The room, situated at the end of a long walk through the restaurant, was small, simple in decor, carpeted, sufficiently cold and had good lighting; with thin sliding doors and walls, so that the noise from guests in the other rooms was very audible. Service was attentive and efficient. Below is the list of dishes that came in descending order:Long Sheng live lobster: Each person was served half portions; the lobsters covered in buttery batter. Meaty and rich and had quite tasty flavors. Chili Crab. Crabs in generous amount of tasty tomato-based sauce with the aromas of curry leaves, flavorful and very nice with two plates of fried buns to lap up the chili crab sauce. Buns are additional at $5.50 each plate. Live Prawns in Japanese Sake. We found the presentation unappetizing, looking like the prawns were simply tossed on the plate. The prawns, medium-sized bordering on small, were over cooked, the flesh sticking to the prawn shells.Famous Pepper crab, hot and peppery. One of their signature dishes and a favorite.Steam Live Sea Bass in Lemon Thai style. The fish was very fresh and the meat firm. Strong lemon flavors which I found refreshing. La La King with dried shrimps and chili padi: was a ‘small dish’ in terms both of edible quantity of meat and clams for 10 persons. The sauce tasted similar to the chili crab sauce minus the curry leaves, and the clams tasted fresh.Handmade Bean curd with Chef’s Sauce. The dish was nicely presented, but there wasn’t that Wow! factor to make it outstanding. The sauce was thin and gooey, and wasn’t tasty. A dish that could be missed or skipped.Crispy Duck. We had a huge fat duck, plenty of meat and crispy bits. Fried to perfection. The meat was not dry or too saltish.Country style Brown rice noodles: We found this very saltish. It was compounded by the salted dried shrimps bits making it even more saltish! Not many of us could finish the portions we had.Desert Mango pudding was served individually. It caused a stir because of the presentation in glass vessels containing dry ice in green water, billowing white smoke as the dish was laid on the table! However, the pudding itself was a huge disappointment. Dry and too firm in texture for a pudding. The taste was unremarkable. It was a struggle to finish our deserts!The two plates of appetizers were charged $6.00. Because we had 11 persons and needed an additional lobster, there was an addition of $56.00 for this. The Set Menu C was packaged at $768.00 ++. There are also charges for tea and towel with the usual Service Charge and GST.Generally, a pretty heavy meal, with six out of eight on sea food dishes. I would prefer next time, to go with an ala carte order. There are other sea food dishes in their menu that have been time tested and found to be favorites. This menu could do with a vegetable component and some of the dishes in this new “ Set menu C.” needs, in my opinion, further work to improve on.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not at all impressed.,-1,20,10/9/2014,"I never like giving negative reviews but I think it is important for those thinking of having a meal at this place to save their money and time especially as there are so many better and cheaper restaurants to pick from. The food was just there, the service was poor and focused mostly on getting us fed and out in the shortest time. I really advise thinking twice about going to the Long Beach. We got a definite feeling because we weren't locals we weren't really welcomed. As for the chili crab, you will do much better for far cheaper at just about any Hawker stand."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very disappointed,-1,20,10/1/2014,If chilli crab is the national dish of Singapore then Long Beach is guilty of unpatriotic acts against the state. At least the crab was super fresh but the dish was quite disappointing. The crab was served covered in a sweetish-chilli-egg sauce which was poorly executed. I think success has ruined this restaurant. I have had much better chilli crab at small hawker stalls and even from my own kitchen. My recommendation is give this restaurant a miss.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tourist Trap - staffs asked additional money for fixed price menu !,-1,20,09/14/14,"I went to this restaurant with my wife on 12/9 . (Table 18 ) we ordered a fixed price menu S$ 138 for 2 persons . We were told by waitress Ms Liao Gun Hui that fixed menu crab is usual weighted 1 Kg but tonight no 1 Kg crab is available . We were told to pay additional S$ 30 for a bigger crab which weighted 1.2Kg . I refused and talked to the Service Manager . She immediately apologized and told us 1 Kg crabs just arrived at the restaurant and is now available at no extra cost . All happened within 3 minutes ! I suggested to the manager to remove the fixed price menu because it is not right for waitress to increase fixed price menu as she likes. I certainly would not pay extra $10 in McDonald for a fixed price meal. Be careful with this restaurant . For me , I will not go back to Long Beach because there are plenty of good and honest restaurants in Singapore . "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood Place But Expensive,-1,30,4/1/2014,"Family of 5 went to try again, but, it has become more expensive this time round.We had:-1) Chilli Crab And Pepper Crab...The pepper was better Than The Chilli.2) Kai Lan Veggie...Nicely Done.3) Frog Legs - Fried With Chilli And Garlic...Portions Were Small.4) Beef Stew...Beef Was Very Tender.5) Fried Rice.On the whole, it was nice, especially the Beef Stew. The Chilli Crab was a bit of a disappointment. Service was good. Even though we had to request for drinks more than once. It saw a full house the evening we went."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good food, but expensive",-1,30,3/9/2014,"Went with a few friends and for starters we had the prawn and chicken dishes. The prawn was great, good size and well seasoned. There was nothing special about the chicken. For mains we had pepper crab, chilli crab, spicy steamed fish and a mushroom dish. The pepper crab was outstanding and everything else was good except the chilli crab which was very average and I thought sweet rather than chilli. The bill for 5 of us was just over sd1000 incl a few jugs of beer. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No crabs? Fail!,-1,10,02/26/14,"We booked a table for 8.30pm on Saturday and would you believe they ran out of crabs by then?! When we were being seated, they told us ""we have run out of Sri Lankan crabs"", implying there were other shellfish but when we were ordering, they didn't have anything at all, not even lobster! If we had known there was no shellfish, we would have gone somewhere else!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab,-1,30,2/4/2014,"I was told pepper crab originated here. It wasn't as good as the other place in terms of taste. The crab we had wasn't fresh.
Other dishes were alright but the food in general was overpriced!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab? Keep Looking...,-1,10,11/22/13,In a country full of great restaurants - this one helps to bring down the standard. I am a single business traveller that's been in Singapore for two weeks and have been impressed every day but at the Long Beach at Dempsey. The only thing worse than the Chilli Crab was the service. No follow up by the waitstaff - the Captain had to take my order. I sat for nearly 20 mins before someone asked if I would like my check - no interest in whether I'd be interested in dessert. A true disappointment. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, weird service",-1,30,09/29/13,"Can't go wrong with chili prawns, pepper crab, steamed garoupa and a great outdoor table and beer on a Saturday night. Love the fact that they peel and shell the fish for you so you don't even have to get messy as before. Only thing, can they ask servers who are obviously sick to stay home, instead of hacking their germs into my food as they prep it? Is that too much to ask in a civilized Sngapore?"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Decent crab...Not so decent servive,-1,30,05/23/13,"As a huge seafood lover I was dying to try the famous crab on offer at Long Beach. I was not completely disappointed but not overly enthralled either. Inviting some friends visiting from Sydney to dine with us we reserved a table outside. On arrival we were greeted by a cacophony of noise from the incredibly crowded dining room and were relieved to escape to the relative calm of the outdoor seating. Once we were able to locate a waitress we ordered a staggering amount of dishes (we were all super starving). Crab, lobster, prawns and other sea dwelling delights were ordered in abundance. It was probably a good thing we did order so much as from that point on all the serving staff seemed to disappear. We would have had a tough time requesting any more dishes. Anyway, on to the important bit...the food. Some dishes were borderline delicious others a little more mediocre. Stand outs included the famous black chilli crab and wasabi prawn. To be perfectly honest though I have had much better.All in all Long Beach at Dempsey definitely has an air of mass production and tourism about it and the service leaves a lot to be desired! I would eat there again but I believe this restaurant may have had it's hey day."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Convenient location, food tasty, service ok",-1,30,05/21/13,"We couldn't reserve a table with the competitor as they were full (on a Monday night) however this restaurant was recomemded to us and they weren't full, maybe 50% full. The pepper crab, spinach and tri egg dish, seafood noodle were all very tasty and the price was reasonable. However the service was pushy when taking our order and then at times slow when we needed more tea and napkins for the messy (but delicious) crab. I felt more like we were in a process to be fed rather than out for casual / relaxed meal with friends. I would return as the food was good but I'd be firmer with the staff to ensure we weren't ""proccesed"" but rather served and indulged. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cheesy tourist trap,-1,20,5/6/2013,"Don't fall for this one - despite the concierge's best efforts to convince me that locals still come here, my insticts told me otherwise. Should've gone with the gut as the food was mediocre and service even worse. Have a feeling that chili crab can be had at a better value and quality elsewhere. Anywhere but Long Beach @ Dempsey!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood at dempsey,-1,30,04/20/13,"Comveniently located at dempsey so you don't have to go all the way to east coast to eat the same thing. Crowded on a thursday evening, so business is bustlingWe ordered a set menu as there were 20 of us. Started with bamboo clams with a good amount of garlic. Then there was fried fish with sweet sour gravy, average stuff. The crispy skin chicken is usually popular. Then the main event, pepper crabs, which were good. The carbs was spicy malay noodles mee goreng, which was tastyOverall it was ok, as it's so mass produced these days as it's tough to rate such a joint as exceptional"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Crabs were great, but service not so much",-1,30,03/25/13,"Went to this highly rated establishment, and as the crabs were tasty, we couldn't get service once our dishes were delivered. We asked for extra napkins as the dishes are quite messy, and she acknowledged with a nod but that was the last we saw of her. They neglect to tell tourists that EVERYTHING is EXTRA as we found out when the bill arrived. The dish of peanuts they bring when you sit down, the wet napkins they give you, and the bread with the crab dishes are all unexpected charges! Then we find out that there is a sink with paper towels in the middle of the restaurant outside that regulars are obviously aware of, but no, we ask for extra napkins and get charged! If I'm paying that much for the crabs, I at least expect better service. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Disappointed,-1,30,03/22/13,We thought we would try Long Beach as we had been in Jumbo the week before and wanted to try a different seafood restaurant. But we were disappointed in the food. The seafood hor fun that we ordered arrived in a lump and look very unappetising and didn't taste any better. The sharksfin soup was missing the sharksfin! Most of the food that we ordered was of a poor quality and the service was also rather poor. If you are thinking of having seafood in the Dempsey area I would suggest that you go to Jumbo and give Long Beach a miss as they are more expensive and the food quality is poor.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Unhealthy environment,-1,10,01/24/13,"Air conditioned restaurant filled with smoking incense. Huge turn off. Food was not cheap, but standard was somewhat above average. Nothing to shout about though."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Spent S$1,300+ here but would not give this place a second chance",-1,20,1/12/2013,It was a family dinner for 8 adults and 3 children celebrating father-in-law's birthday.Chose this place as it was well-known for their seafood. We had a room but it was poorly maintained and rather cramped.Cutlery was not thoroughly cleaned with stains on almost all the pieces we were given. Terrible ...We ordered a set which costs more than a $1K but the fish was undercooked and had to be returned for 'additional rework'.Other dishes were ok but certainly not fantastic for the price paid. The overall experience is mediocre in terms of service. Certainly not somewhere we will patronize again..
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worst Experience Ever,-1,10,12/9/2012," My husband and I love to eat out regularly and we know when the food is superb, good or simply bad. Upon our arrival, with reservations, we were given a huge table for six and seated next to the glass wall which we could physically see our neighbors eating and vice versa. The lady who took care of our table did not know english so it was quite frustrating to get around with the different items on the menu. We finally settled for simpler items, prawns and fish. The prawns came in first very nicely presented and large but the taste was terrible. It seemed it was boiled in sea water and rather raw. The sauce that accompanied it was not too bad to relieve the after taste of the sea water. When the fish came in, we had requested a fried red snapper, it looked like a small fried coy!! This was even worse. My husband just had a few bites of this and had to leave it as it was full of tiny bones. To drink, my husband had a coke and I had a glass of wine. You can't go wrong here but to pay the price for a bad glass of wine surely hurts. The cost in wine was 19.00 for a glass!! The cost of the overall dinner was $128.65!! A big ripoff for what we got. We are used to pay on occasions $400 for two with no regrets if the food was exceptionally good. So the price for dinner is not an issue for us. There are no napkins on the tables to be seem. They only give you wipes and no utensils. You basically eat with your hands if you do not know how to eat with chop sticks and if you run out of wipes and ask for more, you are charged for it!! For sure we will not return. The prices for the food and ambience is not worth it. The only good thing to remember was that they were able to call a taxi for us and this came very fast. We did not have to wait to leave!! Thank God and good riddence. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fresh seafood, but . . .",-1,30,10/13/12,"We went to Dempsey Hill to try the seafood at Long Beach. First, we didn't make any reservation so we had to wait a while; also, without the reservation, I guess, we didn't get to have the good tables. They placed us in the lower 'deck', where lighting was poor. Furthermore, behind our table were what looked to be storage for dirty plates... it marred the already dark ambiance. We ordered the popular dishes - black pepper crabs, buttered prawns, fried kangkong with cuttlefish. While we waited for the food, they handed out a small of peanuts which was not bad at all. When the food came, they looked lovely (sadly, twas just dark for me). The black pepper crabs were huge, but I have tasted better versions. The buttered prawns tasted really fresh. The kangkong with cuttlefish was very spicy; I would suggest you avoid this unless you are really used to 'hot' and spicy dishes. The staff were attentive. All in all, I had hoped they kept their standards by maintaining the same bright environment all through the eating areas. It would have made a lot of difference in our dining experience.As tourists, we came to Dempsey Hill via the taxi; after dinner, we found out twas quite hard to get a ride back to the hotel, so we walked down the road to where Dempsey road exits. There we saw a small stand near a wide parking space. here was a man whose only trade was to serve durian fruit. As we were curious, we sat down one of the stools and ordered for a sweet durian fruit (you can choose sweet, bitter sweet and bitter)... it tasted really good! it didn't have a strong smell (the taxi driver told us, the riper, the less odor), and the man offered disposable hand gloves! I would suggest you end your seafood dinner with this fresh sweet treat!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not so good,-1,30,09/16/12,"When we visit Long beach@ Dempsey i was a little bit disappointed because i am expecting that the food was really excellent. since it was my friend who recommend me to come to this place. so from bukit timah we drove here to Dempsey. they're popular of Black pepper crab, but that night i just want to have a prawns,chicken and the noodles.. the food presentation was ok, the staff is a little bit snobbish but its ok because it was busy at that time. so here it goes when we are about to eat the food i was shock and confused about the food that we order. Do we order food or MSG? all the food is full of MSG. we couldn't even finished our food.i need to drink a lot of water to clear my whole mouth and throat. but still the after taste of the MSG is still there. it lingers into my system. I think i should listen to my friend that i should try the Crab only."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Standard Dropped!!!!!!Horrible Food....,-1,10,4/3/2012,"It was last Saturday night at around 11pm , we were a group 12 people. We ordered sizzling beancurd which was prepared differently from the usual style. The cereal prawns were stale. The steam fish was served overwhelmingly with garlic.We also ordered pepper crab, keow teow and 2 other dishes. For desserts we ordered pudding which tasted very ordinary. Overall, it was a bad experience and will not return to Long Beach which was our favorite seafood restaurant earlier. The quality and standard dropped drastically. Very disappointing...."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Freaky expensive and dishonest,-1,10,02/22/12,"We came for a professional dinner. The Chinese maid had inaudible English. She gave advices on our menu, changing it five times without we requested it. At the end, for 6 persons, the bill amount was 1100 SGP dollars. They charged napkins, deserts separately from menu and so on... INSANE"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach in Dempsey is terrible!,-1,10,02/22/12,"We were group of 7-8 colleagues, who dine at this restaurant last night 21st Feb. We had the most ""horrific"" time when the bill was presented. The Manager who took the order had the tendency of making the customer to pay a fortunate for a food that is so common in singapore. we were recommended a set menu for 6-7, with about 10 dish (that no one on this planet) could finish or eat, and we ended up with a big bill and waste of lots of food. perhaps this restaurants does not appreciate the wastage of food, but one should never recommend to ""customers"" who are not singaporean or local a list of food that is so costly. we had to pay SGD1111 for 6 people! They even charged us for wet towels, and SGD6 for diet coke! What a rip off. Take my pick, i have lived in singapore for 3 years and this is the first time i have had a bad time in a seafood restaurant. And this will be the FIRST and the LAST time we will go there. The Manager of the restaurant was not helpful, he did not even explain how we ended up with such a big bill. The FOOD was normal and i am 100% sure i could have got better in another place for a less amount of money we had to pay. Take our advise, never go to this place, you will have a big hole in your pocket and a shock to your system."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Terrible service - No more crab available at 8.30 pm already!!!,-1,10,1/12/2012,"I went there for my family to taste their chilli and pepper crabs. When we arrived at 8.30pm on a Saturday night, we were told that the only available crab was teh Alaskan one, which is 400 SG$/kilo!!! What a joke. They told us the Sri Lanka cran would arrive during teh night, so we insisted to stay. After a million back and forth discussions with the staff, we finally were made aware that the crab would be delivered and we could have it. In the mean time, other people had to order the super expensive crab. The quality of the service was very poor. They made many mistakes in the order and the ladies giving away napkins and changing plates could not care less!!! I was very disappointed as I went there many times with an excellent experience. This time it was terrible!! Would not go there anymore"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not great,-1,30,11/13/11,"The restaurant was up a hill, not easy to find, even for a local taxicab driver. I had chili crab which was quite tasty but nothing extraordinary to justify the expensive cost. The service was brisk but unfriendly. If you get there by taxi, you might have to ask the restaurant people to call for the taxi and prepare to wait."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh but...,-1,30,11/6/2011,"The location on Dempsey Hill is a nice one, surrounded by greenery and opposite the Botanical Gardens. The place is huge and usually crowded, so do not expect a quiet dinner time. We had one of the private rooms and privacy is restricted to the visual partition of the rooms. We had 3 noisy groups surrounding us and the noise level was the same as if they had just partied in our room. The food is OK lah, the best dish served being the deep fried snapper with mango chilli sauce. The rest of the dishes was just good but nothing special. One last advise, stay with beer for your dinner, the wine list reads nice, the wine is neither stored properly, nor being served at the right temperature nor does the staff know what wine is."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good food, could easily improve in other areas",-1,30,11/1/2011,"We are very glad to have come here, highly recommended by a local. Had the wonderful Chili Crab, with amazing vegetables and crab rice. Delicious!However, the service was so bad, that it nearly ruined our experience. What's up with no napkins???? Everyone gets a wet wipe, and that's it, you are on your own. The problem is that you eat everything with your hands, and all foods are sauce based, so you do the math.I looked over at other tables in the crowded restaurant, and everyone was licking their fingers trying to cope with the absence of the civilized napkin. Weird."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Drowning in service..,-1,30,9/3/2011,"I really do not understand the other reviews complaining on the service, because I was more or less drowning in their very polite service. Almost as much as it stressed me a bit.. I had chilli crab, which was good, but perhaps not as exciting as I had expected. The best part of the meal was the baby cabbage steamed in lots of garlic. I am not convinced that I will go back here, cause I have tasted better food a lot cheaper in this city."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Completely Underwhelming,-1,20,06/22/11,"I was keen to try some Chili Crab in Singapore and was recommended to try here. Wrong choice. The staff weren't that interested in whether I was there or not. Apart from plonking some peanuts and napkin on the table (which was later charged to me) no one took my order for food or drink for 20 minutes, and the crab took another half hour to arrive. I don't know what Chili Crab is supposed to be, but the 'hero' of the dish ie the crab was lost in a mass of chili sauce. Picking your way through the crab to get some tasty morsels was messy ( I needed another 4 napkins to keep cleaning my hands) and the crab's flavour was bland. The chili sauce was too sweet, and not enough heat to even raise some sweat on the brow. I had to go back into town and grab an icecream sandwich to console myself."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,-1,30,04/30/11,"Good food, esp. black pepper crab. However more than once I've booked tables only to find no booking when I arrive. Distracted service."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Not THE best chilli crab I've ever had, but still quite good....",-1,30,01/17/10,"Not THE best chilli crab I've ever had, but still quite good...."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No big deal. But nice 'ambience' with the usual tanks in the background,-1,30,12/5/2008,No big deal. But nice 'ambience' with the usual tanks in the background
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awful service,-1,10,10/1/2008,"Before I start, I am asian and have eaten all over so my standards for what I expect aren't that high! I went to a long beach restaurant, waited 10 minutes to be seated and then 10 mins after ordering was told they were out of crab and I'd have to wait 1 hour before they could get some!I told them I'd wait but to bring out the rest of the dishes I'd ordered, after all I'd come all the way to try the black pepper and chilli crab. Another 10 minutes later, I was told I might have to wait 2 hours so I decided to pack up and leave. The staff were courteous, picked the bill off my table and crossed my orders out.They told me to head to the east coast store, so off I went in a taxi. On arrival, I found that they had called in advance to tell them to charge me for the drinks (all $6 worth!) from the last place!Service was slow, and not courteous for the rest of the meal.Overall, the food is pretty good, the black pepper crab is special but the chilli crab is no better than any other place on the east coast.I would highly recommend NOT ever going to this place."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Poor serve food pace,-1,10,6/3/2018,"Still hungry after 1.5 hrs due to poor serve pace. Staff unattentive. Teapot too heavy to self serve at full pot, might break fingers. Pretty ex for substandard service. Forget to serve some dishes as well. Serve muslim indonesian maid pork porridge instead of ordered fish porridge."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below expectations and disappointment,-1,30,02/27/18,"A lunch visit to Peach Blossom for a celebratory event is an annual affair for me and my family. It was chosen because it had good service and good food, and therefore, we decided to visit it again for the third year this time - thinking that it won't fail us.This year, instead of the ala carte menu, we went for the dim sum ala carte buffet menu. We were led to this table nearest to the exit of the kitchen, which is at the far end of the restaurant. We were still looking at the menu and one of the waiters actually came asking if we would like to have our drinks ordered first. We were flustered as we just settled down but he was insistent that we have our drinks ordered. Thus, having to visit here for several times, I ordered a tea named as ???? without even looking at the menu. It is a tea which I knew the restaurant will have. My brother ordered a ????. To my disappointment, the waiter was unable to recognise that my brother had ordered Oolong tea and was trying to say that there wasn't such tea in the menu until he found it during his panic. And so our drinks were being ordered.As it was our first try at their buffet menu, we did not know which menu should we look at. We queried and the waiter explained to us that we can order anything and also if we were to order dim sum which are not listed in the buffet menu, we will need to pay the outstanding amount. Ok, we understood it. Then came the ordering and missing of multiple orders. The table next to us was a big eater and they ordered more items than us, with similar items ordered and ordered later than us, and theirs were served first but not ours! Oh, not to mention that they were served by the SAME waiter. We later ordered a Cheong Fun from the non-buffet menu and the waiter was trying to tell us that we will need to pay extra in a super ""I cannot comprehend"" intonation plus stuttering. Well, since he mentioned that we will need to pay extra, we said OK! But guess what? It wasn't served at all and we queried him about it. And he said ""I told you that it needed extra money"". Oh.. ok! It's a freaking S$5.80 Cheong Fun and you think we cannot afford it? But anyways, we decided to just end our happening lunch experience as we had enough of begging for our food like a beggar. Also, the food was really not appealing anymore. The Xiaolongbao was not seasoned with loads of Huatiao wine as before, the XO carrot cake looked more like XO fried egg as I ate more eggs than the cake, and the tea was really not flavourful anymore. I think I will really reconsider or not consider my next visit to Peach Blossoms."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below average food,-1,20,12/25/17,Neither is the menu creative nor are the standard dishes any great. I may have given the place 4 stars had it been in a hawker center but you have different expectations from a Mandarin Hotel restaurant.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Peking Duck,-1,10,09/19/17,"We have just dined at Peach Blossom, unfortunately. After reading great reviews we thought we would book. One of my favourite and my husbands absolute favourite dishes is Peking Duck. We ordered 1/2 a duck, this was not carved at the table... not a problem, but what we were brought already wrapped 8 pancakes filled with a small square (8x8mm) of duck skin, just skin, no fat, no meat. We were then bought fried rice with tiny chunks of brown duck meat. Hmm wonder what happened to the breast meat if our duck? We also had the jelly fish and the XO Cod, neither were particularly good. But the Peking Duck, ridiculous :("
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Chef recommended set meal is awful,-1,20,6/3/2017,"Went there on a Friday with my Friend and was recommended the Chef recommended set meal and you can't believe it's from a restaurant of this standard.First after the first two dishes we had to wait more than half an hour for the next dishes while our eight ERS were already served two dishes. Second they served Wagyu beef but the sauce was too sweet and the sweetness overpowered all the taste and you couldn't even tell if it was Wagyu beef, really terrible.Third the entrance was some kind of sweet and sour fish but again it was extremely sweet as if eating sugar.Good for our long waiting the manager offered some roast meat and duck.Advise if you go to this place; don't ever order the set meal as it's really crap.Order the traditional Cantonese à la carte menu, roasted meat, dim sum or fried rice.Tasted the god as if it was hawker food and then when the bill of $217.00 came, really not worth and agreed with my Friend that better we ordered some roast meat, Cantonese soup and some vegetables.Bottom line again don't order any set meal there you'll be completely disappointed."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Really disappointing,-1,20,6/1/2017,"It was the start of a six week holiday and we were so looking forward to a great first night extravanganza meal.Regrettably we were so disappointed. The restaurant was only 25% full and that should have alerted me that it is no longer popular.We chose the Set Dinner for $S62. The portions were tiny, lacked imagination and flavour. The duck entree had two tiny slivers of duck, the prawn and and scallop dish had one prawn and one scallop. The main of honey infused lamb loin had two sugar cube size portions of fatty lamb. The fried cod in a BBQ sauce was nice. With a bottle of wine the cost for two was $S290. Maybe the entry level menu did not showcase the gourmet offerings that might be available from the more expensive set menu options, but the food we were presented with sure wouldn't encourage us to want to venture back and pay even more money.The week before we had just enjoyed an entry level set menu experience at China Doll in Sydney for a similiar price and that meal was just fantastic. Every course was delicous."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Expected More,-1,30,05/18/17,"Spent 4 days at the wonderful Marina Mandarin Hotel . We chose Peach Blossom for our last night , anticipating a special evening . We were let down by timing and lack of ambiance. Our order consisted of 2 soups , 1 main , special fried rice & 2 glasses of wine. Our mains appeared on the table as we were eating soup. We were a bit perplexed by the timing of the service. Adding to the disappointment was a large table next to us with 2 toddlers who were allowed to noisily run around their table. Their baby was also crying. We are parents ourselves but wouldn't choose to bring children to such a restaurant after 8.30pm . While this was beyond the control of staff it showed a lack of thought and planning. The restaurant was divided into two sections . Why weren't couples seated elsewhere? Loved the view of Marina Bay sands but our $ 150 could have been better spent elsewhere. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),expensive,-1,30,05/16/17,tasty but very small portions and very expensive for what we recieved a pleasent atmosphere and prompt service but worth searching for better value for money
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim-sum quality deteriorated a lot,-1,20,4/7/2017,"I have dined in this restaurant 2 years ago and the quality is very good. This time when I went there for dim-sum again, found out their quality deteriorated a lot. All the dim-sum are pre-made and pre-steamed, after we placed order within 5 minutes all the dim-sum is served on our table. By the taste you can tell they have been sitting around in the kitchen for a while. With its price, I expect the quality to be higher with made-to-order dim sum. This restaurant is not very busy, I do not see a need to pre-steamed all dim-sum and serve in a speed of fast food restaurant. Will not recommend it. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Lots of selection, but service fell short",-1,30,3/10/2017,"Plenty to choose from, what we did have was very nice. Service was very slow with staff opting to serve Asian customers and friends / family of the kitchen staff first. We ordered 12 spring rolls, a vegetable dish & 2 mains, we questioned if that would be enough for two and advised would be more than enough. We aren't big eaters and found we were still hungry when we left. Dishes were a lot smaller and more expensive than all the other restaurants we ate at this week. Had to ask twice for the bill which was strange as they didn't look busy with only 1/3 of tables occupied. Bit of a shame as had read good reviews about this place, the hotel was first class on the other hand. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Decent food but not outstanding and the service was grumpy,-1,30,3/9/2017,We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant when we went for dinner which was a good sign. It was far from crowded but we were greeted at the door as if we should have made reservations. The food was very good but not as good as I had hoped. I had the idea it was a family restaurant as there were many children. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),POOR SERVICE & FOOD,-1,20,1/7/2017,"Shared a business lunch for r. Out of the seven or so courses we shared, only one was really good. Service was not attentive--each of us took turns pouring tea. At end of meal, waiters moved in a table to set it up? Very uncouyh."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing experienece,-1,20,1/2/2017,"Food:Roasted pork - the ratio of lean meat, fat, skin is totally wrong. Apparently over-cooked and very hard to chew.Roasted duck - way too dry, way too tough!Shrimp vermicelli roll - there is only 1 shrimp in each roll, which is very absurd. If you are running low on shrimps, then put it as out-of-stock.The only dishes that are okay are shrimp dumpling (har gaw) and egg custard bun.Service:Upon arriving, they couldn't find our reservation (we called like 3 hours ahead to make reservation yet they lost track). And the lady at front desk just pointed at a chair saying ""you sit over there first"" without any apology or politeness. We waited for 15min and no one came to us with any information, hence we had to ask again.The girl named Emma took our order and she is the only one that we find friendly and responsible. After confirming our order, she left the menu with us so we could add on if needed. 2min later, another lady came over (named something like soon teng) and grabbed the menu away. Then she asked whether we've ordered, so we told her that we want to keep the menu. She said okay and placed the menu randomly on another side of the table, blocking the position for serving dishes. The basic courtesy we expect is that she at least places it where she took it, but no."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointed - average at best,-1,30,11/12/2016,"We booked this restaurant for tonight 12th November when we were in England based on the great reviews on here that also determined that we would stay at the hotel.We booked for 930 as we were arriving from Jakarta. Arriving at the restaurant we were kept waiting while they found a table. I'm guessing there must have been a worse one., but we were tucked in the corner next to the servers station - dirty plates and other dishes a glorious sight!!The food was okay but we were rushed - perhaps the proximity of 1030 and the closing time of the restaurant was to blame.The servers were not attentive and the ambience of which others have spoken was non existent. We could barely make ourselves heard over the clattering of plates and dishes as they tidied and prepared the tables for the next day.There was nothing special about the meal - equally as good food can found in other restaurants.A huge disappointment"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Excellent food quality, bad service, terrible handling of glassware and average value ",-1,30,09/18/16,"Had dinner in this restaurant before leaving Singapore the next day. It 's conviniently located in Marina Manderin Hotel but hard to assess because of the formula one race. The food was lovely, and the chef cooked excellent quality food that we all enjoyed. However, the service was on average only. A waitress accidentally breaked a teacup in our table while serving food, which reflected on the terrible handling of glassware and ruined the overall service and ambience of the restaurant. Otherwise, the service will have been nice. The price was expensive but Reasonable because of the high quality food served. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very disappointing.,-1,20,08/28/16,"Excellent service but very bland food and overpriced. The spring rolls tasted as if they were bought frozen from a supermarket. The Soy chicken was a very small serving and tasted like it was simply poached in water with no sauce, flavour or seasoning to speak of. The pork collar in xo sauce had no punch at all. We also requested tap water but was presented with 3 bottles of water over the course of the meal valued @ $10 each which was only realised when paying the bill. Very disappointing overall. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Super poor service, bad atmosphere. Does not deserve to be anywhere near the rank it is",-1,10,07/30/16,"Was looking forward for a nice birthday dinner. Made reservations specifying this is for a couple birthday dinner. Came to restaurant, they had no reservation but got a table as restaurant was empty. We got put in a bad spot with worn furniture from the last decade with no atmosphere whatsoever and floodlight lighting. Servers were extremely non-attentive and after waiting and finally checking what's going on they were all chatting in a corner. Food came out of the kitchen spread over 15 minutes. It was hard to just have a regular meal. Either just rice or just meat or just vegetables, nothing together. BAD. Just choose one of the many restaurants in the city."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Kitchen's Standard Marred Front-line Service,-1,20,3/12/2016,"My mum & I just had the dim-sum buffet lunch at Peach Blossoms.The front-line service was praiseworthy. Reservation was smooth. Reception was warm. The waitress (Alicia) was attentive & thoughtful. It is thus regrettable the kitchen's standard detracted the service quality from the front-line team.Right from the start, the speed of food readiness was not exactly expeditious. Especially for a non-crowded restaurant. It was tolerable ... until the last order of main dish was made. It was a simple order of just 1 small portion of noodles. After 10 minutes, Alicia took the initiative to hasten the food. After 20 minutes, I asked for the bill. After the bill was signed, then the 1 portion of ordinary noodles finally appeared. By then, it was more than 23 minutes since the order was made.Perhaps the kitchen team mistook the concept of dim-sum buffet to be that of Slow Food Movement. The original intention was to assess if the place's a potential venue for a birthday celebration at month-end. The kitchen team has made the decision for us."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Maybe it was a bad day... but bad bad bad,-1,10,1/10/2016,"I saw this restaurant on a list of the top 10 Dim Sum restaurants, and was excited to try... in short very disappointing. It could have been a really bad day for the restaurant, and maybe a one off, but I felt that the review needed to go forward in the hope that there is some way the management can learn from it.We were the first in the restaurant on this Sunday morning, and we quickly settled in to ordering from the a la carte buffet. The most basic items they had on hand on the tray they brought to our table, but when we ordered off the menu, this is where all the problems began. We actually waited 90 minutes for our orders to come out, and with three small kids, this was not an ideal situation. At this point, other tables which came to the restaurant almost an hour after our arrival, started receiving food that we had ordered, and yet... still nothing for us.At this point I asked one of the staff where our orders had gone, and the staff just said they would check on it. Still no answer or anyone came back, so I called for the manager. Finally when the manager made time for us, he told us that the computer system had got jammed up and the orders weren't coming through. It would appear that they didn't think telling anyone they screwed up was in order. Shame they couldn't use something more advanced, like a piece of paper and a pen.So... finally after multiple complaints, the food started to arrive. One order which was mean to be Lobster in a Cheese Sauce, turned out to be lobster in a basic canned nacho cheese, this felt like it completely ruined that lobster. Then when we got the beef, it was way undercooked, and all gristle.Finally the biggest insult was that we had a friend who avoided pork due to her faith, and because if this I ordered roast duck, and then for my kids roast pork, which I made as two separate orders. They then decided that because they were way over time, they put the two items together on the same plate. When they brought it our, I explained that there was a reason why I separated the two orders. The waiter's suggestion was then to put the existing dish on two separate plates... I almost fell off my chair.I really wanted to love this place, I was excited, and my wife can tell you how much I wanted to come... but really.... very very very bad experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good won tons,-1,30,12/31/15,"This is average when compared to a Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. You might find the comparison unreasonable since this is Singapore but there are many good dim sum venues in Singapore. We had prawn rice rolls and also pork rice rolls which were good but came in a strange soy that I've never had before and I've eaten a lot of rice rolls - trust me. The won ton noodle soup is good however for a won ton. We also had dumplings in spicy sauce which tasted average at best. The service is good, however when we were there the place was practically empty so it was to be expected. The restaurant itself is fairly standard looking so not sure it would be ideal for celebrations but it is fine for dim sum if you are in that area. Would I go again?? Probably not.. Would I recommend.. Yes if in the area and had to eat dim sum or was staying in the hotel and didn't fancy taking a walk outside."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Average to good,-1,30,10/31/15,"Dim sum is average to good. Service is fine. Have to there many times.. Like their new year raw fish salad, very tasty....."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good food, very expensive!!",-1,30,10/26/15,"eat there some time ago... good food, small portion, freaking expensive! Recommended dish... Shark cartridge soup, roast duck and roast meat, can't remember the rest. everything is ok , NOT the price!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Not a place for dim sum,-1,20,09/14/15,Ala carte dish was good. However the dim sum was a great disappointment. Har kow and siew mai taste like those from supermarket straight to the table.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Always a Good Experience,-1,10,07/23/15,Dining at Peach Blossom has always been an enjoyable experience. We are regulars at Peach Blossom and has been for past 5 years. The standard of food has always been consistent. Even when we host dinners with more than 30 people. The dim sum dishes are also very good. Service and ambiance is good. Good for business entertainment too as they have private rooms.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Only Regular Customer should come?,-1,10,7/12/2015,"My family was at the restaurant this afternoon. Surprisingly this restaurant was only treated their regular guests with the warm hospitality. As we are the first timer we did not receive what a normal customer should receive. No staff take our order or served drink after sat down for more than 10 minutes, no change of plate, order was forgotten etc..."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Value for Money?,-1,30,11/2/2014,"The setup and ambiance is very good. Very Chinese decorations with hostesses in cheongsam. There are many round tables which could sit up to 12-14 pax. We could see that the restaurant has tried to come up with new and special dishes to stand out among the other restaurants. But unfortunately, my family and I agreed that after eating there for 3 times in the last year, the ""unique"" dishes are not as good as the classic dishes. For example, their ""normal"" siew mai is better than their specialty quail egg siew mai. Overall, though the food is average, i felt that the price was slightly high considering the quality of food. But I must say that the setting of the restaurant was very cosy."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),the worst Chinese meal we have ever had!,-1,20,09/20/14,"our first night at the hotel and to celebrate we thought we would have a good Chinese meal at Peach Blossom. The broccoli was over cooked, the spring rolls were soggy, the rice tasted like it had been cooked in old oil, the prawns in egg tasted like they had been rolled in sand first but the worst thing was that although we had left more than 80% of our meal not once were we asked if everything was ok!! very disappointing...."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Probably the worst chinese meal I've ever eaten,-1,20,08/30/14,"There on business we decided on the meal for 2. Expecting a real feast we ended up still hungry at the end and for 200 Singapore dollars including a little wine monstrously expensive. Two soup courses, no rice, grumpy staff no return."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing,-1,20,01/19/14,"A very nice setting but sadly the food was bland and uninspiring. The peeking duck was delivered to the table in very small pancakes, we would have preferred to have done our own. The pancakes were tiny and very thin. The skin was not at all crispy. The soft shelled crab had a sad heavy coating and lacked flavour. The noodles with the remaining duck meat were very bland. The clay pot chicken was definitely the best part of the meal. We were encouraged to have rice dumplings for dessert, these were small chewing gum textured balls with dried longon, wolfberries and lotus bean paste in a warm sweet liquid. Sounded great but they were AWFUL! Cost approximately £90 and we came out hungry. Not to be recommended."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Magnificent kitchen - let down by service arrangements,-1,30,10/7/2013,"This must be our sixth or seventh dinner at Peach Blossoms in the Marina Mandarin and we love the chef's signature dishes particularly Almond soup with fish maw and Wagyu beef. We have tried to get them to serve dishes selected sequentially but they always seem to come together without warming stands, so you either race the excellent food down your throat or eat some of it cold. Easily fixed by thinking about service logistics more. Also on this occasion the service was attentive to the point of being irritating - virtually watching you to swallow a mouthful or serve the last items from a dish before whipping it away. All in all felt like pressure to eat and get out, not assisted by the need to rush to eat the food while hot. It was not like this on previous occasions that we dined at Peach Blossoms so we will probably go again and see if we can get the dinner served in a sequence.At the prices charged, the restaurant fails to do justice to its excellent chef and needs to lift its game.David C"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing end to our stay,-1,20,08/30/13,"I travelled with my family and on our last night at the hotel we decided to try Peach Blossoms. The food was average and overpriced. We ordered the Peking Duck and could barely eat it. Was full of bones - I've eaten Peking Duck many times and not come across this so not sure what the idea is but a lot was wasted due to the bones.Service was also disappointing as the staff focused on the local customers. It was clear we were toursits and guests of the hotel (perhaps the staff figure we may not return so no need to provide good service?). At one point the chef came out and did the rounds of the restaurant, focusing on the locals - we were all but ignored.Were provided the dessert menu however our waiter never returned to our table so we had to forgoe dessert, get the bill and leave."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),No quality for the money,-1,20,04/21/13,I try to avoid to eat in hotels because the menu there is usually limited and prices high. In cause of Peach Blossom in Marina Mandarin it works - the prices are exorbitant and the food quality is average comparing to the Singapore in the whole.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fake Crab, low quality meats",-1,20,03/21/12,"The buffet is set up to feed the mst food to the most people at the lowest cost - not price. The use of fake crab whensurrounded by sea, offering meat products that are blends like a spam or meat bi-product do not belong in this 3 star quality hotel masquerading as a 5 star. It is easier than going across the way but it is worth it to walk across the bridge to the convention center to the food market there."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Chinese Ever,-1,10,02/20/12,"There is little I liked about this restaurant. Food was bad, service was bad, and the price was high for the bad food and service.Also this location serves shark fin, and does not even know that the rest of the world is stopping this practice. The servers try to creat a more expensive bill by not letting you see the lunch menu. They also do not explain the menu very well. I would definately not recommend this restaurant."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice setup and excellent...,-1,30,6/10/2008,Nice setup and excellent service...though food is not as delicious as I thought.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Decent food. Mom in law...,-1,30,02/28/08,Decent food. Mom in law loves it!

French,Angelina_MBS,Food wasn’t too bad but service definitely in severe need for improvement!,-1,10,19-Aug-18,"Went there on a first visit with a few friends for tea time. When we were there, there was a short queue but we soon got seated. Thereafter, the crowd started to die down and there were soon some empty seats here and there. We decided on what to eat after 5-10mins and waved for a waitress to assist us. And we were immediately shocked by her response! When we said, “hi, can we order?” , she responded with a “cannot, I will get back to you in 5 mins”. What kind of customer service is this???After that we finally placed our order, btw we ordered 1 teatime set (which according to the menu comes with a choice of coffee, tea or chocolate - we went for an ice chocolate) and also another 2 glasses of ice chocolate plus 1 more ice tea. In addition, we also ordered another 2 slices of cakes for sharing. The teatime set came first (without the drink), followed by 2 ice chocolate and the ice tea. The ice chocolate which should come with the teatime set never came. We had to remind the waiter for a few times and it was a chaotic situation. After the ice chocolate came, I took a sip of it and 1 auntie came over (instinct tells me it’s the lady boss, maybe?) asked if I drank it because the set came with a different chocolate drink! I’m like ermmm ya drank it already. And her next response was, oh then you have to pay for this drink because it’s not part of the set! Hello, so now I’m supposed to pay for something because of your own internal mistake? Freaking pissed. This was episode 2. After that, we waited another 10 mins for our cakes and had to again remind the waiter to serve. The place wasn’t even crowded and there were at least 4 waiters. In conclusion, service was very bad and I would not pay a return visit even though the food was acceptable. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Food took a really long time to come and came cold,-1,10,31-May-18,"We had a party of 7, food took more than 40mins to come. Of the 5 pastas we ordered, 3 were cold. It actually tasted nice if it was warm. The fish was bland.We gave feedback that the food was cold.After payment, the staff came to explain that because of our feedback, the service recovery was to waive the cost of ice water. According to him, that's the best the ground staff could do. We didn't even expect to pay for Ice water in the first place!Needless to say, we won't be eating there again!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Failed me! ,-1,30,20-Mar-18,I takeaway the mont blanc cake from marina bay sands and the texture is like ut's been there for awhile. The merengue base is stick to the cup.
French,Angelina_MBS,Worse visit ever,-1,10,11-Mar-18,"Had high hopes for this place as the Paris branch was great. Service was slow and forgot our orders. Even when the food and drinks came, everything was a mess. There were chocolate marks everywhere on the cup and table, the tea was cold by the time it arrived. Will not bother to come again. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Horrible service,-1,10,3-Mar-18,"Went to the branch at marina bay sands for dinner. Only a handful of diners but yet the service was extremely slow. Waited 15 - 20 mins for them to take our orders despite signaling to the waiter a couple of times. They did apologize for being being under manpower but there weren't many diners ! Waiting for food being served is another 20 -30mins and my coffee wasn't even being served and we have to personal walk to the counter many times to request for the sauce which was never delivered. Settling of bill is another pain! One of the waiters whom I believe is the manager simply ignored us a couple of times by doing non important stuff like arranging cups etc at the counter. When the waiter finally acknowledged us , he went to cashier and then walked away leaving us puzzled that instead of punching in the system and preparing the bill, he walked away ... so to summarize , it took another 15 mins to settle the bill! They even billed me for the coffee which was never served! Overall experience was unpleasant and horrible! "
French,Angelina_MBS,A mediocre dinner,-1,30,26-Feb-18,"There was no one at the entire restaurant when we had dinner. Food wise, nothing fantastic other than the renowned chocolate drink. I was surprise that the restaurant ran out of salmon when I ordered the Singapore salad. Will recommend the restaurant only when you need a nice chocolate drink or a nice tea. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Below standard,-1,10,18-Jan-18,"Firstly, not recommended at all.Food/dessert selection is very limited. At our visit, there were only 5 desserts to choose from, excluding signature Mont Blanc.Food quality is below standard. The shrimps in the pasta was not fresh with the mushy chalky texture. The portion is small. The bacon seems worse than the one in your school sandwich. Totally disappointed."
French,Angelina_MBS,Unimpressed ,-1,30,29-Dec-17,"I went to the outlet at MBS today.
Coffee machine was down.
2/4 tea selection unavailable
No Mont Blanc and lemon tart though other cakes were available
Service was slow at every step of the way
Food portions small
There are other options at MBS"
French,Angelina_MBS,Hugely disappointing ,-1,10,10-Dec-17,"We first came here a few months ago and left feeling hopeful that there is finally a decent French patisserie in Singapore. 5 visits later, we are sad to say the service and the quality of food has just gone rapidly down the hill. The staff was clueless and ignorant, the food was extremely slow to arrive and the quality was just plain horrid. So safe to say we won’t be coming back for a sixth visit. Not sure how they will survive if this continues but I do wish them luck. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Just OK,-1,30,26-Oct-17,Went there for breakfast. The pastries and the scrambled eggs were quite nice. So was the fresh orange juice. The hot chocolate was delicious but very rich. The fruit salad turned out to be from a can topped with some blueberries and a strawberry. The service was nice and prompt. I did not like the atmosphere - either you sit in a dark spot downstairs or upstairs where it all looks scrambled together. Overall value for money regarding breakfast is better elsewhere.
French,Angelina_MBS,SHC,-1,10,18-Oct-17,"It was my 1st visit to Angelina as I am Survival Chic's (SC) Member entitled with 30% discount. When we reached Angelina on 15/10/2017 at 6.30pm as per our reservation, it was quite empty except a couple at the back. We were the only diners after they left and remained so when we left. We flipped through the menu and were disappointed that both the selection of food and pastries were very limited. so we decided to have light dinner by ordering a chicken and fish dishes and it turned out that the fish was acceptable at best, but the chicken was quite bad in taste and flavour. This was not the end of our unhappiness. When we settled the bill, I found that 20% instead of 30% discount was given. I asked the only waiter why this discrepancy and was told that the manager (whom was not at the scene, I noticed the waiter made telephone call to him) said so. I contacted SC's Customer Service the next day and SC confirmed that the correct discount should be 30% for up to 5 pax. I would like to presume that Angelina is not a honorable restaurantas compared to another similar type of restaurant, ANTOINETTE, which we have visited many times and enjoyed the food, pastries and services. For sure, I will never go back to Angelina again."
French,Angelina_MBS,Below average food that's overpriced,-1,30,11-Oct-17,"Had the vegetable risotto that came out cold - I don't know if it's because it took almost half an hour for the food to come, which in reason is itself indefensible. Portion was small for something that cost $32 after get and service charge but thankfully I wasn't too hungry then. It surprises me that the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu, having to take a look at the menu with every order we gave. "
French,Angelina_MBS,OK,-1,30,19-Sep-17,Angelina's has changed. Has become less upmarket. Not sure if that's a good thing. But I guess it's still ok.
French,Angelina_MBS,Nice chocolate,-1,30,17-Sep-17,Nice hot Chocolatiers drinks that can share but it's thick and rich and very hard to finish alone and expensive
French,Angelina_MBS,I don't feel anything yet :(,-1,30,11-Sep-17,"~last year after a great dinner night out 4 of us went searching for dessert and stumbled on Angelina, but without any prior knowledge of the hype of this place~a very inviting dessert chiller beckoned BUT an unreal effort of the staff in an almost empty dining area pretty much ignored us standing at the front over the menu stand and when entertained at 8pm Thursday decided to let us know they have to check if we can be seated~it was a WoW moment of disbelief but keeping this to a minimum I'd informed the staff that we're here just for desserts and will take any table anywhere before they let us in (maybe it was an hour and half to closing time???)~anyhoo we had 3 items and I remember nothing of note except the treatment and won't be back ever"
French,Angelina_MBS,Disappointing,-1,30,7-Aug-17,"There was much hype on the place when they first opened. We tried the pasta as well as the cakes, both were disappointing. The pasta was average and the cake were too sweet and on the dry side."
French,Angelina_MBS,Value lunch sets,-1,30,29-Jul-17,"Ate twice in this restaurant within a week, and had two different experiences.The lunch sets that my friend and I tried offered smart value for money (13.80sgd++ includes a starter, a main and a choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Furthermore, the pastries that we enjoyed for dessert is discounted to only 8sgd, instead of 10/13/14sgd, and the montblanc is divine!) Bill was about 53sgd for two persons.The second time I visited was mid-afternoon, wherein two of us ordered the high-tea set and the third person had ravioli. The latter was commendable; however, the former can significantly be improved. Bill was about 108sgd for three persons.As another reviewer had observed, the hot chocolate served in this branch is awful; it is NOT the same as the one served in Rue di Rivoli:("
French,Angelina_MBS,"The case of a hot chocolate went wrong, tasted horrible and was different to the one in Paris.",-1,20,22-Jul-17,"I had the chance to try the original Angelina in Paris, and their hot chocolate is the best I have ever drank. However, the one in Singapore tasted different, and I mean it in a bad way.Angelina's hot chocolate is unique because theirs is known to be super thick and filling. I enjoyed the one in Paris because the rich taste of the chocolate was able to penetrate the thickness, which resulted in a complex but an enjoyable drink. But the one in Singapore is just a poor imitation of this speciality. Yes, it was still thick, but the layered taste of chocolate was not there. It was just a plain thick and bitter. As one reviewer has said, it was a torture to finish it. So, it did not only taste different, but horrible as well.What truly disappoints me that the taste should not have been like this. I almost felt cheated. Ideally, the drink should taste the same, no matter who makes it or where it is made. If Angelina in Singapore cannot recreate the same drink, they might as well change its name in their menu.On the other note, the service is great. Their Mont-Blanc tea is nice, has a flowery, calming smell and pleasant taste. But seriously, that hot chocolate is just plain unforgivable."
French,Angelina_MBS,Yummy Truffle Fries,-1,30,25-Jun-17,"I must order the truffle fries every time I'm here. One of the best!
The half cooked egg is well seasoned too and extremely moreish.
The pastries taste particularly fresh on this visit. Every bite brings great satisfaction."
French,Angelina_MBS,Cheapest set lunch in town,-1,30,24-May-17,"Considering the rest of its menu, the $13.90 three course set lunch is really cheap. However, the portions are small, but you do get to taste its signature chocolate drink. Tried four of its pastries, including the signature Monte Blanc. But it's the Opera that stood out. Wish they would serve more of the items from the opening menu. I missed those! "
French,Angelina_MBS,Pleasant,-1,30,18-Apr-17,Pleasant. Had the set lunch. Menu now a bit on the light side. It was not quite enough to fill me. So sad.
French,Angelina_MBS,Average but cosy spot for afternoon tea,-1,30,2-Apr-17,"Tucked away in a quiet spot of the revamped Capitol building, this is a cosy place to rest your feet, enjoy some cakes and good quality tea away from the nearby bustling malls."
French,Angelina_MBS,Average food experience,-1,30,13-Mar-17,"Food and ambience was so-so, quite disappointed with the hot chocolate which was their signature but the taste turned out a little weird. Overall average experience and overrated."
French,Angelina_MBS,The menu has changed. But not for the better.,-1,30,17-Feb-17,The menu has changed. Main courses have been reduced to five. The steak has also been changed and the price has increased from $36 to $45. The café was quiet on a Saturday night and so it was a good place to chat with friends.
French,Angelina_MBS,Limited Menu,-1,20,15-Feb-17,This place is more of a place for tea. Not suitable for dinner as the menu is very small. The pricing is also quite stiff. A vegetarian pasta cost $29 while barramundi cost $32. Food is average at best. They were also understaffed.
French,Angelina_MBS,Food & cakes not to expectation,-1,30,12-Feb-17,"Tried for the first time but disappointed. Mains are not worth the price. Understand that cakes are meant to be sweet but the taste of ""white sugar"" is too strong, tried Mont Blanc, it is bad. Think the chocolate croissant is better. Dine in & spent closed to $180 & packed the half eaten Mont Blanc but was charge $1 for a small box."
French,Angelina_MBS,Food and Dessert,-1,30,30-Dec-16,Came here for 1 for 1 with the entertainer app. Mains were good and hearty. Seafood risotto had a bitter aftertaste. Beef stew and sea bass (no snapper that day) was well cooked. Signature mont-blanc was normal and tasted similar to red bean paste. Opera cake was nicer in my opinion because I'm a chocolate lover. 
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food,-1,30,29-Dec-16,Food was good but not wow. Cube roll was a bit over cooked. Seafood dishes were nice and yummy. Service was decent.
French,Angelina_MBS,"great ambience, ok f&b",-1,30,25-Dec-16,"We went for their desserts and tea - was probably expecting much more so was disappointed, especially for the price we paid."
French,Angelina_MBS,Things have Changed!,-1,30,14-Dec-16,"Had another dinner there recently. Angelina's appears to be trying to cater to a different market segment now. Red Snapper has been changed to a cheaper fish. No more complementary bread rolls. On the day I went, only 4 types of macarons."
French,Angelina_MBS,Not for me,-1,30,10-Dec-16,"I went there due to the popularity of the dessert.Environment: Nice for tai tai high tea, chit chat and tea for few hours. Service is goodDesserts: Very pretty and nice looking. Taste good but all very sweet to me, it sounds funny if desserts are not sweet but it is way over and all of us cannot even finish it as once you ate more, you feel bloated.Price: Mid range, to me it is quite expensive to pay $10+ for desserts"
French,Angelina_MBS,cosy and relaxing,-1,30,6-Dec-16,"My friends and I were very excited to check out the highly recommended desserts and hot chocolate here, and since it was lunchtime, and they had just started offering a set lunch menu, we decided to check that out too. The set lunch was incredibly good value, with 3 courses. We tried all the mains, and they were all good! To top it off, you could enjoy your Mini Hot Chocolate as part of the set too! Just nice! I particularly liked the Butterfish. We decided to spoil ourselves with their famous cakes. The newly created Mont Blanc with coconut crisps was overly sweet, and not memorable. We all enjoyed the raspberry cake, which had good texture and balance."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good service but food is not value for money,-1,30,19-Nov-16,Their mains are expensive and comes in a very small portion. Note that I'm already a small eater. Also it taste normal nothing fantastic. You can find lot of cheaper and taster meal elsewhere. Their cakes are good though but tad expensive. Average $12 excluding gst and service charge. Frankly I won't go back again even though the service was really good.
French,Angelina_MBS,Not my cuppa hot chocolate,-1,20,4-Aug-16,"I'm a hot-chocolate lover! It's my everyday comfort drinkSo when I heard of how good and rich / thick the hot-chocolate was, I went gagaSince I missed the one in Paris, this is my best chance to tryTo my disappointment the drink fail me so miserably. It's overly thick that it's no longer enjoyable. Soon it turns to torture when I had to share that pot with someone else. I sat there for the next 1.5 hours trying to finish it. I think Coco Black has an even better richness than this. Also, they were ravings about its Mont Blanc but it was so dry, lacking moisture. I'm not sure if the one in Singapore is done differently? But it gives me second thoughts on whether I should go to the one in Paris if I'm back there.Utter disappointment..."
French,Angelina_MBS,underwhelming,-1,20,31-Jul-16,The coffee was ok (if you like brewed coffee) and the service was good. But this place is somewhat sad as the entire mall does not see many customers. The cakes are way too sweet and not freshly baked (they said they import them from France...). But the biggest drawback is the price. Why would anyone pay these sort of prices for a piece of cake?
French,Angelina_MBS,"Nice place, unusual and hard to find location",-1,30,14-Jul-16,"We stumbled upon Angelina by accident. It is not easy to find but we had wanted to go there because we have enjoyed Angelina in Paris.We just had a hot chocolate and a tea and we did eye the delightful-looking cakes, but we were to be having an early dinner soon after, so we held back.The staff were good, very attentive, the place was reasonably empty, atmosphere was very much lacking, but if you want hot chocolate and tea, head to Angelina."
French,Angelina_MBS,Disappointing main courses,-1,20,3-Jul-16,"The service was alright, but the main courses we had were bad. The mushroom risotto tasted bitter with just a few strands of mushrooms. The scallop and truffle ravioli was just passable. The signature dessert - Mont Blanc was overly sweet for me."
French,Angelina_MBS,Could be better,-1,30,14-Jun-16,"I had a cup of black coffee and a popular le Mont-blanc (dessert: on-top of the muffin size dessert is with chestnut cream, meringue + whipped cream). I've tried many ""mont-blanc"" dessert, I personally still prefer ""mont-blanc - chestnut dessert"" from Japan is still the best. I cant taste the chestnut. I don't really like the combination of meringue with chestnut cream. Is like eating coarse sugar with cream. The coffee (with steam milk) is ok, it comes with a chocolate.Service is good and friendly."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Nice place for a hangout, not a meal",-1,30,1-Jun-16,"If you are looking for a place to have tea and hangout on a lazy afternoon, this is a good option. Food and drinks are overpriced in my opinion. You are probably paying for the service and the ambience as well. If you are planning to have food there, it is not bad, just not value for money. The only thing that i truly enjoyed was the truffle fries. Even the signature Mont-Blanc was just average. With that price, you could get much better food somewhere else. I had the hot chocolate. Rich and smooth. I would probably revisit another time just to enjoy the chocolate over a nice book or simple tea with friends."
French,Angelina_MBS,An insult to the Paris tea house,-1,10,22-May-16,"Firstly lets get this straight. Angelina Paris is fantastic. Why they would bother to ruin their name with this awfully local singapore version is a mystery. It's half asleep. No receptionist when u walk in . They get all the orders wrong and don't even understand when you ask for certain items that are on their own menu. When ordering an omelette angelina they bring a club sandwich. When you ask for no tomato in the omelette, they still put it it in ... And guess what.. They used tinned tomatoes in an omelette !!! When you ask for an order a side of potatoes Dauphin they don't know what that is. They omit to bring the side as ""must charge for it "" Waiters are all uninterested in the menu and have a problem understanding an order. The omelette here is half the size of the Paris version ... They probably weighed the eggs and conducted a mathematical profit account before serving it. The only good item on our table was the coffee which was excellent. A total Singaporean comedy ..."
French,Angelina_MBS,Nothing out of the ordinary...,-1,30,6-Mar-16,We went to Angelina in December 2015 and give it a try for their pastries as it was well advertised in various magazines or newspaper. we cant really share all the hype mentioned and it was nothing what sets them apart from a Laduree or Antoinette to be honest. High prices for a slightly more then average quality and service.
French,Angelina_MBS,Not fantastic,-1,30,24-Feb-16,The hotchocolate here is good. I think they use some real chocolate chunks mixed with cream or milk because from my table I could see the bartender mixing it up. Apart from that this place is a little expensive and the food is regular.
French,Angelina_MBS,So So. No lines. Hardly any people.,-1,30,16-Feb-16,"Looks like it is 2 levels.Cold chocolate wasn't really cold enough. It's like luke warm plus ice. Super rich cocoa. Asked for little cream but it still looks a lot. No Long spoon provided and when I signalled for one, they came with the bill!! They claim it is not normal to include a Long spoon for cold chocolate but then there is no such thing on the menu. Only saw hot chocolate on the menu. But sometimes really really one should use common sense which sadly isn't so common nowadays.I've not had the cold chocolate drink in Paris because the line is usually impossible. So I can't compare.But they are famous for this in Paris and this just doesn't taste 'famous'.They have set breakfasts, brunch, sandwiches, salads, soups, main courses, cheeses, pastries, desserts, macarons, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, Viennese pastries, fruit juices, Soft drinks, beets, champagne, wines and spirits.Just be prepared to pay Angelina prices.There is also a tea time set menu from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for S$49++."
French,Angelina_MBS,Okay... Only.,-1,20,21-Jan-16,We had their signature 3-course set menu. Tried the famous hot choco and famous mont blanc- not really good. Just so so. I prefer the Au Chocolat French Bistro at Marina Bay Sands last time. Way better than their menu.
French,Angelina_MBS,Not that great,-1,30,13-Dec-15,"Ordered the famous hot chocolate and it was really very good. Tasted like real chocolate. Just too rich and sweet for me, suggest to share someone if you do order this if not might have sugar rush. I also ordered the lorraine quiche which i thought was really over priced. It tasted like it was microwaved. Nothing special. The salad was very little, just tossed carelessly with some sauce, maybe balsamic vinegar yet doesnt have much taste. The nicest thing on the plate was the cherry tomatoes which i can get from supemarket. So yeah, i am not impressed. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Hot chocolate to die for...,-1,30,2-Nov-15,"Honestly, this is a fantastic hot chocolate. Citron tart or Mont Blanc with it and you'll be very happy. The savory menu isn't wonderful, so just go for sweets."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good brand but poor service,-1,10,23-Oct-15,The food is so so but after our meal they charged us twice on our credit card with same bill by recieving alert twice to handphone! We did complain but no responsible until we call our bank to cancel one bill of charging! Later we show the charging transaction from the bank and the duty manager wont accept the mistake! So far that bring down the so call six stars venue... Hmmm
French,Angelina_MBS,They are only good at desserts and nothing else,-1,30,20-Sep-15,"I was there for a casual lunch with 2 business associates. We ordered the 2 course set lunch ($37++) and shared two desserts. Set lunch consisted of a huge salad, which was acceptable in taste and presentation, and wagyu beef pasta. The beef was hard and the tomato sauce was obviously not freshly prepared. It reminded me of the typical $6-$8 pasta at food courts, which is heated up from frozen central kitchen packages. Although the portion was huge, each of us only finished about half the portion as the quality was bad. We decided to save our calorie quota for the desserts.We shared a chocolate eclair and a choux pastry called Josephine. The eclair was good but nothing extraordinary. Josephine was tart and fruity, so it was a welcome light dessert after the heaviness of the beef and pasta. What saved the day was the mini hot chocolate, which reminded me very much of the thick chocolate which I savoy red very morning when I was holidaying in Spain. How I wished I had a churro to dip into the thick chocolate drink! So, have your main meal elsewhere and go to Angelina just for your dessert. This is the place to be seen on a lazy Sunday afternoon. "
French,Angelina_MBS,I expected more :(,-1,30,13-Aug-15,"Well I absolutely loved Angela in Paris and expected the same kind of vibes. Unfortunately this cafe is seriously tiny and feels hidden not as massive and open spaced as the French one. The chocolate drink I had, i think I ordered wrongly feels like I am drinking cocoa. Which means, i can't drink it.."
French,Angelina_MBS,Decent omelette horrible seevice,-1,10,10-Aug-15," Decided to try this new place and had to wait for 20mins until we asked a staff of we could grab a seat upstairs. Had asked for mayo for my fries but the waiter was too busy to remember the request. When another came with the dessert, we didn't have forks for the cake. Luckily the lady serving us was still attentive. They really need more training for their staff. Unlikely coming back for awhile "
French,Angelina_MBS,No need to go back,-1,30,26-Jul-15,"(note: did NOT try the cake, so not an all-encompassing review)Three of us came here at 12pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't full but more people starting coming in at around 1230pm. Ordered an iced tea, a glass of Merlot, truffle fries and the signature hot chocolate (which was SGD12). My friend like the iced tea (I didn't try), she said it was fragrant and had other fruit essences in it so it was like iced tea with a twist. The truffle fries were fine. I was excited for the hot chocolate, but it turned out to be just okay. It wasn't hot enough and was too sweet - yes it's chocolate, but the sweetness balance was off. I actually liked the Max Brenner (Vivocity) hot chocolate better. The tables are really small, we had two tables pushed together and when all the plates/glasses arrived, it felt really packed. Service was okay. Unfortunately the whole area still smells like paint/construction. From what I've read about the Paris branch, this place is definitely not comparable."
French,Angelina_MBS,An Expensive Disappointment!,-1,30,21-Jul-15,"Only had cakes and tea. Did not have the signature hot chocolate as it seemed too sweet since it came pre-sweetened. Tea was a signature blend and has a pleasant orange flavour. Ordered three cakes - an opera, a mango passion cheesecake and the mont blanc. Of the three the Opera was the most successful. The cheesecake was the worst as it seemed to have assimilated some of the flavours of other foods it was stored with in the fridge. I cannot explain but it definitely was not pleasant.I wasn't impressed enough to return to sample the other dishes."
French,Angelina_MBS,Bad Experience – pricey and bad taste!,-1,10,19-Jul-15,"Due to the local newspaper recommendations, we visited this café on my sister birthday. My intention was to give her a good surprise but ended with a big disappointment.We ordered their famous hot chocolate drink and Mount Blanc cake. For the hot chocolate drink, it turn out very thick, not hot at all and taste like medicine. The worst hot chocolate drink we ever had in Singapore. For the famous Mount Blanc cake, the outer brown colour cream was still hard (not de-froze enough) and obviously the cake was just taken out from the freezer not long ago.The bills was $60.05 for 2 drinks and 2 piece of cakes. We will never come back to this unprofessional café again."
French,Angelina_MBS,Hated this place. Their famous Mont Blanc cake was awful.,-1,10,13-Jul-15,"The entire place was really cramped and had the feel of a cafe that was trying too hard to be upmarket (but failing disastrously at it). Service was poor and slow and their famous Mont Blanc cake was probably the most awful cake I've ever eaten in my life, with chestnut cream that was overpoweringly sweet and so dense that you could have stuck a fork in it and not have your fork threaten to fall out at all. Upon checking with the staff, I realised this was because their cakes are flown over from France (which to me, simply means their cakes aren't fresh and which lack of freshness showed up in each bite).Their other signature was their hot chocolate drink. This fared a little better but was too thick and rich to be enjoyed beyond the first few sips.With such stiff competition from other cafes and dessert places in Singapore, it's hard to imagine this place doing well beyond the first 6 months in Singapore."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great atmosphere but strictly ok good..,-1,30,2-Jul-15,"Had a rare Monday afternoon off and thought of checking out the new Capitol Piazza when we came across Angelina. We ordered the onion soup, ham and cheese club sandwich and a cold cut/cheese appetizer. The servings were really generous I must say..the onion soup which my hubby had was really nice but the bread of the club sandwich seemed fried and it was quite cheesy too. We ended with a lemon tart which my hubby liked but sour desserts are not my cup of tea. Overall was a pleasant experience..service was very good and I will go back to try their chocolate desserts and maybe brunch menu! "
French,Angelina_MBS,The desserts might be better...,-1,30,25-Jun-15,"We chose Angelina Restaurant / Tea Room because of its quaint, sophisticated beauty and because Coco Chanel frequents this elegant exquisivity (in France itself, of course) often. The exterior suggested a classic touch of elegance while the interior exuded artistic charm and comfort amongst a strong French setting.For mains, *L had the Truffle Ravioli (SGD$29.00) - tiny little jagged squares of pasta stuffed with cheese. Lovers of cheese would gladly indulge in this pasta dish, sinking their teeth into the firm pasta so that the burst of cheese could fill the mouth deliciously - truffle hints were detected amongst the cheesy indulgence.*J went for the Wild Mushroom Risotto (SGD$23.00) - actually all three of us were eyeing this dish. It did not disappoint, not with its rather generous serving of truffles, rocket salad and brothy-rice. The flavour could have been a little stronger, more sapid with mushroom taste, but we were only able to taste it here if we bit into one of the shrooms pieces literally. I also thought that the grains were cooked till too mushy, lacking the bite that I usually enjoy in risotto dishes.For me, I chose to have the Steamed Black Cod (SGD$35.00) served with Shellfish and seasonal vegetables. Black cod always contains a scrumptious buttery smoothness to its texture, combined with a taut, slightly springy tone; the flesh was saccharine. I also enjoyed mussels and clams, being a seafood lover. But oh, the broth, the broth was the ultimate climax - combining the goodness of the seafood and every sip drew out the need to want more; even the soft baby potatoes were sufficiently immersed with the tasty broth.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-angelina-tea-room-patisserie.html"
French,Angelina_MBS,Fantastic Place for chatting and relaxing,-1,30,20-Jun-15,"When my hubby and I vacationed in Paris back in 2011, we tried Angelina Paris Patisserie for high tea. The place was really posh and classy with their unique architecture. Of course, the price also a bit steep.My hubby and I feel that it was not bad so we decided to try the newly opened outlet in Singapore. We were there at 2.30 pm and we got our seat without waiting.We ordered Coco tea and their signature Mont Blanc Tea suggested by the staff. Besides, we ordered Angelina Omelette, macaron and lemon tart. However, the lemon tart did not served, probably they forgot about it. I love their tea, it has the coco smell and nice. The macaron isnt the best which i had before but the atmosphere was really great and relaxing. Great place for chatting while having high-tea."
French,Angelina_MBS,Mediocre Pastry Standards,-1,30,18-Jun-15,"The Citron Tarte's crust was slightly soggy, Le Mont Blanc's chestnut paste was too sweet and heavy. The taste and texture fail to balance even as we ate it with the cream under the blanket of chestnut paste.Bestie's iced chocolate was not smooth but my marron tea smells heavenly and was delicious.To be honest, I was disappointed because the two standard tarts that I go for didn't meet my expectations for this cafe."
French,Paul,Slow service,-1,30,23-Sep-18,"Came here for a coffee with some friends. The place is simple and quiet.
The service was rather slow as we waited for a long before someone took our order. The drinks also took a long time to be served."
French,Paul,Poor service,-1,20,20-Sep-18,"I have had food from Paul's for takeaway in the past and love the food. No complaints there. But recently we decided to sit down and eat.. over 30 mins before someone served us, even though we asked 3 different people who said they would come soon. We only ordered cakes that were all ready made, took over 10 mins for them to arrive at the table, and drinks order was wrong. The staff were polite enough but seemed to either have too much work to handle or need better systems in place to make it run smoothly."
French,Paul,Rudely turned away,-1,10,12-Sep-18,"Paul’s Paragon, Singapore. My family approached and waited at the greeting station to be seated. Many employees saw us waiting. No one approached us or greeted us. We saw an empty table near the back of the restaurant and approached it to seat ourselves. We were promptly and rudely told the table was reserved and they didn’t have a table for us. We will never eat at Paul’s again because of their poor attitude and disrespectful service. I will go out of my way to advise all friends, family and business associates to bypass this restaurant. There is no excuse for poor rude service and attitude."
French,Paul,Crazy busy place,-1,30,4-Sep-18,The queue to enter the restaurant was horrendous. But it was worth it for the delicious tarts and Oakley flavoured lattes.
French,Paul,Busy place with stressed staff,-1,30,3-Sep-18,"I always loved to come here for coffee and tea, only if I have two or three hours to spare as this place is always crowded and staff take awhile to attend to you. Not for people who have 30mins to spare."
French,Paul,Busy place and yummy tart,-1,30,1-Sep-18,This restaurant is very understaffed. Should only go if you are not in a rush. The blueberry tart is yummy .
French,Paul,How on earth can this legacy have excellent ratings.!!!!,-1,10,31-Aug-18,"Ordered a pot of Earl Grey tea for S$6,50 good for 1 pax for 2 cups at the Paragon Orchard outlet. Pot of hot water came separately from Paul depuis branded tea bag. No instructions on infusion timing. Soak for 15mins still far from plain water with some yellow colouring. Tasteless of course as tea dust bag is so small with this almost 500ml of water. S$6.50 for a pot of tea maybe a budget for this most expensive city in the world but not an acceptable standard for a legacy restaurant like Paul depuis."
French,Paul,Worst service ever. Don’t waste your time,-1,10,12-Aug-18,"My 3rd time eating at a Pauls in Singapore. All experiences have been nothing short of catestrophic. Service on all occasions was utterly disgraceful. On one occasion they didn’t take out order for 25 minutes. When I approached the counter to try and place an order, I was told to go back to my table and that they would come. Except they didn’t. Another occasion, our waiter seemed to be angry that we came and abruptly announced that they had pretty much nothing left on the menu available. This final occasion, one persons meal came after 20 minutes and all the rest took an hour. For simple foods. We had to keep asking for cutlery but we’re only brought one set, we ended up sharing until they finally brought us cutlery."
French,Paul,Very bad service,-1,10,16-Jul-18,"They gave us a used spoon. Then forgot to bring the pastries we ordered, then upon being reminded brought us the wrong one & finally came back & said they have run out of the pastry we ordered!"
French,Paul,"Very bad service, the food is ok",-1,20,15-Jul-18,"I am a frequent Paul customer, mostly in the US and other Singapore Unit. The food at this Unit is fine, consistent with other Paul Units. However, the service is really bad. This is my third time here, either ordering food in the counter or sitting in a table, the servers are unprofessional, un-polite, and it looks understaffed. In order to get their attention, we need to wave and raise our voice. Once the servers come, they barely stop by your table and listen to you; mostly they take your order “on-the-run” and there is no opportunity to ask any clarification question from the costumers side. "
French,Paul,Terrible food and poor service ,-1,10,8-Jul-18,Ordered a steak and the meat was supposed to be cooked medium rare. Parts of it was raw and the rest was chewy. Really poor quality meat. The bread felt like it was baked yesterday and the fries were definitely refried. The creme brulee was the worst I ever had. Overall avoidable place with poor service to top it.
French,Paul,Paul Le Kioske Changi,-1,10,5-Jul-18,"Awful service. Rude answers and even showing the hand and leaving.
Terrible sandwich.
Coffee mediocre at best."
French,Paul,Incredibly awful!,-1,10,2-Jul-18,"I know Paul from France and they usually serve good food. However, I had lunch with my son at Paul, Ngee Ann City, and it was beyond terrible. He had the ham and cheese crepe and when we pointed out to the waitress that it tasted like the cheese or ham was off, their was no reply. We told her she should let the chef know, but I honestly doubt she informed him. Also, I wrote to Paul explaining the situation - no reply! This is why I am posting my first negative review on TripAdvisor ever. I simply don’t want other travellers to be as disappointed as me."
French,Paul,Zero stars!,-1,10,23-Jun-18,"A simple order of apple turnover and palmier took 30 minutes!
We asked for crepes to be delivered later but it arrived before pastries.
The food is so so :-("
French,Paul,Horrendous pastries with equally horrendous service to match,-1,10,15-Jun-18,"Food: Croissant was ugly and served without even being toasted. True enough, taste was mediocre. Chocolate cake was dry, totally lacking in flavour and fragrance. To my amusement, they could actually botch up a glass of latte; it tasted so bland that a Starbucks latte even on a bad day easily triumphs it. Service: Inattentive, insincere, ignorant team of service staff who seem like they do not possess a modicum of pride in their work and delivery of service. Requested for a glass of iced water a few times to no avail. Unless ""iced water"" is a completely foreign subject, I do not understand the look of confusion on this one particular lady waitress; she couldn't even be bothered to utter a word in reply appropriately. Overall, don't bother about wasting your money here. You can have better pastries and service elsewhere in Orchard. And yes, even Starbucks. You are welcome everyone."
French,Paul,Terrible Sevice,-1,10,13-Jun-18,"Went here for a breakfast and coffee, both were ok. But the service was terrible, one waitress appeared to be actively avoiding and ignoring customers. They seemed completely disorganised. Every person that came in after us had to ask to be served, will never go there again. "
French,Paul,Good for takeaway but horrendous for dining in,-1,10,29-May-18,"We were planning to have lunch at the nearby Japan town when we were at Kinokinuya bookshop. Then our Mother saw this establishment reminding her of the one she patronised in Paris. So we decided to divert and had our lunch here instead.There was a small waiting line outside. Not bad considering it was lunchtime.Then we were ushered to a table at the corner. Good, we thought.Order was taken then the waiting began.The 2 orders of a sandwich and a sausage omelette came earlier. The other 2, a quiche and a spring chicken, took a good more than half an hour after the first 2 orders were delivered.We noticed that the second wave were delivered almost immediately after we asked them to check our orders. Coincidence?The food quality:In general, quite average for the legacy and the price level.We shall stick to takeaways next time"
French,Paul,Worst service with mediocre food.. word Paul ever been to. ,-1,20,26-May-18,"I am an ardent fan of Paul cafes in Europe.So naturally was thrilled to have Paul restaurants in Singapore.Been to the ones Paul's in Singapore where the food is average. But this Paul in Takasimaya takes the cake ad the worst. Customer service is practically zero. No body actually services you. Its a game trying to get attention of a waiter .And they don't actually look at u when they take an order ,serve . The waitress just dropped the cafe on my fable and rush off.To add to insult, the coffee we ordered were diluted. No coffee taste at all. Both the Caramel Latte and Cappucinno.And don't order the Surprise dessert. It is a surprise as the cream brulee is nothing like it. And the macaroons are so soft u have to chew into it.Worst Paul every been. Hope they really improve a lot. "
French,Paul,I can’t believe how bad the service is ,-1,10,25-May-18,"I recently ate here and it is by far one of the worst restaurants I’ve ever visited in singapore! Food was quite bland and the service is Just horrible... we had to wait for more than 45 mins to get our food and we had to ask the waiters again to give us water, when we had already asked twice, Croque- monsieur wasn’t too bad but the honey baked chicken thigh with rice was very bland. I couldn’t taste any honey in it and worst of all it had no flavour.Overall, the service and food really left a vey bad taste in my mouth, never will I ever come back here."
French,Paul,DISH WATER FOR COFFEE,-1,10,19-May-18,"Paul's Paragon.I ordered a cafe Medici and it tasted flat, like plain white coffee with no flavour.I explained to a staff who got defensive and made an excuse it only has little bit of orange and chocolate, I couldn't taste anything at all.2nd staff appeared to be defensive yet again and by now causing a quite a Scene! All I asked was to replace s coffee! My husband at this point said change the coffee or refund it.I was served a NEW cup, which tasted like mixture of DISH WATER and dregs of cigarettes mixed in.It was Thick and gloopy.I was shocked to see such bad attitude for such a minor problem, I payed even for the dish waster they served up.I am never going there again."
French,Paul,Poor ambience,-1,20,15-May-18,"Recently went for a family breakfast. The furniture is so old and worn out. The wooden tables are quite scratched and banged up and the upholstery is frayed on every chair. This just gives a poor ambience.Overall the food and service is okay. However, not all servers use trays to deliver drinks and handle the glasses by putting their four fingers and thumb all around the top edge of the glass where we drink from."
French,Paul,Choose sweet over savoury,-1,30,30-Apr-18,"We came here for lunch and had a chicken salad and chicken salad roll (or pain in French). The roll wasn’t flavoursome or crunchy, the overall taste ok. The salad had a lot of leaves and a very sharp vinegar dressing, and took longer to arrive than the roll! Don’t choose the savoury option here, stick to the sweet offerings and you’ll have a better dining experience."
French,Paul,Paul Le Kiosque,-1,10,30-Apr-18,"very bad quality of sandwich, still trying to chew it and the ice coffee latte is like coloured water so it is really not worth"
French,Paul,"Poor, no wonder it was quiet.",-1,20,24-Apr-18,"Stopped for lunch, seemed very quiet compared to other places nearby.....
Waitress was pleasant enough, but the food was ‘ok’ at best and fairly pricey for what it was.
There are much better places nearby."
French,Paul,Tea party ,-1,10,22-Apr-18,"Most disappointing Very poor service , while the quality of food has been enjoyable in the past today was really the worst I have ever experienced!!! Embarrassed to take friends there and not worth returning.How very sad for the person who made the initial effort to set up the restaurant."
French,Paul,extremely BAD and TERRIBLE SERVICE!,-1,10,13-Apr-18,"ordered chicken breast flute on multigrain and prawn pasta, Only the pasta arrived and they forgot about the sandwich. I reminded them and waited . after 15 mins I reminded them again on my order and apparently the first waitress did not key in the order , the 2nd waiter send my order to another table! by the time my sandwich came is 30 mins later!. NO WORD OF SORRY SAID ! NO APOLOGY! ALL they did is give me a blank look~!!the waitress and waiter are badly 'trained' and rude! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!Good sandwich but EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE!don't even have basis service !shocking!I would rate your service below par!"
French,Paul,Terrible Service,-1,10,10-Apr-18,"Took more than 30-45 minutes just to get drinks. The service for lunch was even worse they didn’t even get the order correct
Would not recommend it"
French,Paul,Disappointing and misleading menu,-1,10,31-Mar-18,"Restaurants from big chains to independent operators increasingly lure diners with menus declaring their “organic,” “locally-sourced,” and premium Wagyu beef status. Restaurants have the right to advertise food and beverage products to properly identify them. To misrepresent menu items is a violation of what is known as Truth in Menu laws. The issue is that you really don’t have a lot of enforcement for false advertising.Here at Paul in Ngee Ann City, it’s less lunch and more the incarnation of every Singaporean’s fearful suspicions about misleading menu. It’s verging on deceit. The smoked salmon on top of baked potato pancake in the menu turned out to be on pale, limp hash browns. Nowadays, it gets a little challenging to define some of these terms. That’s why it’s difficult to hold restaurants accountable who don’t serve what they say they’re serving.In the meantime, I will be vigilant about the food I order by educating myself about the foods and phraseology . This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
French,Paul,Not Recommended,-1,20,30-Mar-18,"Was shopping at Takashimaya and stopped by for lunch. Despite being established in the 1800’s, this local branch didn’t have service not taste on top of list. Ordered the new on menu honey chicken over garlic rice, and vegetable quiche. Took about 30 min before food arrived. Checked was dry and had no honey taste. The quiche was ordinary. Many had to go up to the register to get their bill. Facility either had insufficient staff or management isn’t strong. "
French,Paul,The worst place ever,-1,10,27-Mar-18,"I ordered a seafood pasta and one juice for lunch. It took more than 40 minutes for them to serve one dish to a guy who came before me. What's worse, they forgot my order and I had to wait another 20 minutes. I asked them about my food for 3 times but no one came back and told me how long will it take. They were extremely unfriendly and looked unprofessional.Some clams had sand in it and pasta was overcooked.It was the worst restaurant in SG and I will never visit the place again."
French,Paul,AwFULL Service,-1,20,28-Jan-18,"The Sgrean chubby aunty on duty on 13Aug2017 at about 16:25HRS was snobbish...at takashimaya outlet. No smile no service at all. If we were not there for a bday celebration, i would have give her a good lecture. Thanks to the cakes flavour thus 2stars instead of one."
French,Paul,I love Paul but not up to standard for outlets in Takashimaya and Tanglin Mall,-1,20,9-Jan-18,"I discovered Paul while I was working in banking in Japan in Tokyo in akasaka area,The food was amazing and the service perfect and the shop freshly opened. The Paul in Takashimaya is very nice furnished however the service is incredibly slow slow Sooo slow that you want to go... My husband's stake was cold and they couldn't explain why... I eat there too many times have a lot of examples... However the sandwiches are good. The ones you can take home. Very fresh. This part of the business ""take away"" is very good. But if you want to have a meal there not a good idea. You ll get frustrated. Very On the other hand the outlet in tanglin mall 's service is very good but the place is kind shabby cleaned...I am it is not really really clean sparkly, the take away sandwich here is somehow less fresh and crispy than in Takashimaya outlet. But the restaurant service is way better than in Takashimaya.I like Paul very much and I eat in this restaurant in many countries. I wish they will get better here so I can go here as well...."
French,Paul,It IS The Pastries That Are Good,-1,30,2-Jan-18,"We were at the Paragon outlet. The service was ok, and so was the food. My wife preferred the one in Bangkok. She did not like the dood there and her reaction was ""so-so"". I liked the soup of the day...tomato. Other than that I tend to agree with ther that the out let in Bangkok has more variety."
French,Paul,Ok service,-1,30,22-Dec-17,"This place is being blasted for service. Not sure why, it's pretty normal to me. Nothing special for the drinks, but tolerable"
French,Paul,Really bad service,-1,10,17-Dec-17,"We pop into Paul's at Marina Bay Link fairly often for coffee a pastry breakfast and unfortunately last weekend when we went down for breakfast after ordering coffee and breakfast we waited for about 15 minutes for coffee and when my Wife went up to the counter asking how much longer it was going to be was informed that they were short staffed and she just needed to wait.Firstly make sure you have enough staff, not the customers problem. Secondly and this is important it is now what you say but how you say it, the dismissive nature in which my Wife was spoken to was unacceptable. How sad, so many places to choose from and one staff member creates an atmosphere of pure negativity.I assure you out of principle I will not be returning, albeit I do like the custard slice as an indulgence once in a whileStaff make or break your business!!!"
French,Paul,Terrible service and unprofessional staff,-1,10,16-Dec-17,"Went to Paul for dinner but it’s a shame I did not manage to try their food as we left due to bad and unprofessional service. Decided on what to order and waved for the service staff to take our order but did not assist us till we asked for the second time.A full timer came over and did not apologise for keeping us waiting and when we finally get to order the menu we wanted, the waiter smugged and mentioned that it is not available without recommending what is good and available.Avoid this place at all cost as we as paying customers do not deserve this kind of service standard of service staff."
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crowded and bad service",-1,20,11-Dec-17,"Food was overpriced for the average quality, ordered truffle fries and the afternoon tea set. only the moelleux chocolate cake was worthy of calories. Staff were lacklustre, requested for chilli sauce twice before they remembered. Even the bill has to be asked for twice. Not worth a 2nd visit. "
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crap service",-1,30,10-Dec-17,"I cannot fathom a restaurant which hires young serve staff who cannot communicate with the patrons. I had a frustrating few minutes with an inexperienced non speaking wait staff before u was attended on by what was obviously an older and more experienced staff. I waited inordinately long for cutlery and water. I had to remind various wait staff before I got my water. This marred my dining experience as service is so intrinsic to the dining process. I ordered a steak with two sides which cost $29. The steak was okay (not great). The side dishes were not particularly delectable. There was a long line waiting to come into the restaurant but the restaurant itself had many empty tables. There is work to be done on their seating process. All in all, not great. "
French,Paul,Standard dropped,-1,20,9-Dec-17,Haven’t been here for a while. Here for dinner. No queue. Was quite disappointed with the service and food. Service was poor. Food was just so so. Will not come again. 
French,Paul,Over rated and bad service,-1,10,9-Dec-17,"Like most of the restaurant and the trends in our customer service. Paul at Ngee Ann City has continued to meet the expectation of the “I don’t really care” attitude. Waiting to be seated we were not shown to the table so we were wondering should we wait or..?We go head on our own and when we seated down the waiter just lightly throw the menu. When I asked what’s the soup of the day.. er.. I don’t know I need to check. So a clear first sign you are not ready for that day when the cafe open. I wonder if he know when is his pay day?When the soup and 1st main came just lay on the table without asking who is having which dish. So simple. The staff is one of the experience of what I believe your restaurant or cafe trying to bring to your patrons. No passion, the “I don’t care” attitude is not uncommon here. So cheap is not good and good won’t be cheap. But if one’s passion for what he is doing is measure by the value then honestly that what does this world deserve that person then?I notice no eye contact when they engage with the customer. Well here’s why some overseas brand didn’t survived in Singapore. Not just because the increasing rental but the attitude of the staff. Oh by the way, the attitude to Caucasian customers seems different though. Didn’t know Paul has such practises."
French,Paul,Worst service ever,-1,10,5-Dec-17,"I cannot give any comments on food and drinks, they simply never arrived. The inefficiency of Paul's waiter and service brigade is overwhelming. There are so many of them, but they are so poorly organized that you watch them running around and doing all but what you would expect them to do - serving customers in the best, friendliest and most efficient way possible. We only ordered coffee and smoothies but after 20 minutes we gave up and left. Considering the options there are in Singapore, we will prioritize those cafe's in the future treating us as customers."
French,Paul,Went for breakfast but wouldn’t bother again,-1,20,26-Nov-17,"Great location, food was ok. but just can’t seem to get it together, ordered two meals that were the same and only got the second when we chased it upSlow on delivery had to chase up items and wait for return of change from billLife’s too short for bad service! "
French,Paul,Extremely poor service,-1,10,25-Nov-17,"Don’t understand why people queue up to have lunch at this place. The food is ok, but nothing special. The staff is terrible. Slow, incompetent and unfriendly. Something must be wrong with their facial muscles as they seem incapable of smiling. I waited 15 minutes before someone took my order. I had to draw the attention of the waiting staff three times. As I got seated the people at the table next to me asked for their bill. They repeated that request several times. Their bill came after somebody took my order, i.e. they waited at least 15 minutes. They subsequently had to wait another 10 minutes for their change. That’s 25 minutes to settle the bill! The people at the table in front of me went through the same ordeal to try to order some food. They gave up and left.The restaurant is dirty. I was seated next to a wall which is completely coffee stained. Avoid this place at all cost!"
French,Paul,Bad service ,-1,10,5-Nov-17,"We were attended by waiters who were rude and frustrated with customers and among themselves. Drink came 20 min and food almost 45 min as orders was not put in. Saw waiters went from table to table asking if the dish he was holding was for them. When asked why the potatoes was not cooked inside. First waiter said ‘it’s steamed’ and second waiter said ‘that’s how it serve, raw.’"
French,Paul,Terrible green tea macha frappe,-1,20,26-Oct-17,"Didn't read the review before I went. Had a short meeting there with a business associate. The green tea macha frappe has too much milk, no green tea. It's not drinkable. One black coffee and one frappe cost $14.71. Price on the high side."
French,Paul,Misrepresentation of menu,-1,10,16-Oct-17,"I went there for breakfast with my wife and was appalled and thoroughly disappointed with the cafe.I ordered Macha green tea frappe and expected something to resemble green tea but what I got was white without any hint of tea. Too much milk.I ordered what was the equivalent of their big breakfast judging from the photos in the menu but the sausages used were entirely different. It looked like the cheap frankurters you get in the supermarket.When I asked the staff why the marked difference in presentation, they replied that I should not depend on photos when ordering food. Sad. They didn't even clean my salad properly."
French,Paul,Nice place but Service is terrible,-1,10,1-Oct-17,"I have frequenting Pauls since it opened. Each time, the service gets worse. Today, I asked for water 3 times and ended up getting it myself. 25 mins for a coffee (my wife's came after 15 mins - no idea why they were not served at same time) and 30 mins for a bread basket - an item that requires no cooking, but simply placing precooked items in a basket ! My patience with. Paul's has run out. Pity as the food and location are both good."
French,Paul,Ants inside the food,-1,10,27-Sep-17,"I totally cannot understand. It was my first meal. I ordered a course menu so a basket of bread was served. After I take one of the breads, I realised that there were ants inside the basket. When I informed this to a female, she apologised and told me that she will bring another basket. However, I did not want to eat here anymore so I told male staff that I do want to cancel the order. I only had a sip of drink but he still wanted to charge me. I asked him to put the drink in take away cup but I didnt feel like drinking so I threw away. It totally ruined my day and I just wasted money. I will never ever visit here."
French,Paul,Service was very bad,-1,10,26-Sep-17,"Me and my mother waited to be shown to a table, but the staff didn't bother to show to a table. I have seen better service in other cafes in Singapore and around the world. I wouldn't go there ever again."
French,Paul,Birthday disaster,-1,10,22-Sep-17,"Everything just went wrong. From the first start we ordered bottle water instead it was warm water, and the waiter just put it at the corner of the table and hoping we were the one who will distribute to everyone. Until one of my friend ask her to distribute the water. And the food are taking so much time, for only salads it took over than 45 minutes to come. The same goes for the drink, and also a birthday cake that never come out. The food tasteless The waiters look confused and unprofessional, maybe they don't have a proper training.. will be my first and last time coming here."
French,Paul,No Alcohol ?,-1,10,20-Sep-17,"I was surprised and disappointed at finding out that Paul stopped serving alcohol . When I asked why , no credible answer was given .
I suggest this fact is displayed clearly OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT to avoid fooling would-be customers ."
French,Paul,Awful Service,-1,10,16-Sep-17,"Have visited this venue on several occasions however this time the service was shocking. We had to wait about 15 to place our order, we only ordered 2 cold drinks and 2 Tuna rolls. The drinks and 1 roll came I had to follow up 3 time and about 20 minutes later the 2nd tuna roll came. They clearly didn't the order right in the 1st place as the waitress appeared to not really concentrating on our table order.. The service was quite shocking, there appears to me no management direction of staff and all staff appear to be serving all the tables so they look like they are running around like headless chicken. And again while waiting for then bill we had to ask several times for this.. the staff appear to be wrapped up what ever task they are doing at that time and not taking into account customers around them.The tuna itself was fine however the salad had seen seen better days and was not fresh "
French,Paul,Dreadful service.. not worth the wait,-1,20,9-Sep-17,"We came here on a Saturday evening and waited for at least 10m at the maitre'd when there were plenty of available seats. Waiters and Waitresses breezed by with sour expressions. After sitting down, reviewing the menu we asked to order and the waitress came to order. We ordered an all day breakfast, a sandwich and fries. The lady said she would check on whether the sandwich was available and let us know if it wasn't. After 30m, after the breakfast was eaten we asked for the sandwich. She told us that she forgot to tell us there were no more sandwiches, and she forgot to order the fries with the kitchen. We won't be back. It's just not worth it. "
French,Paul,Better to take away,-1,20,6-Sep-17,"It was a weekday lunch time, around 1:00pm. I ordered a set lunch and a glass of orange juice. They didn't serve me anything for half an hour, not even the orange juice nor the starter salad. So I told one of the service staff that I hadn't received anything yet. He went to check with the kitchen, and came back, saying my order wrong. I told him my order again, but I didn't receive anything for another 15 minutes. So I cancelled my order and left. I like their bread and pastries there though, so it's faster and better to take away your food from the cashier, though the staff at the cashier is also slow and unfriendly sometimes."
French,Paul,Awful food & service - don't go!,-1,10,31-Aug-17,"Just dreadful - service is simply grotesque - slow, entirely inattentive and seemingly focused on just getting through the day... painful to watch but even worse to experience.Food is mediocre at best - dishes arriving with 10 minutes interval for a table of 2 for a quiche and a croque-monsieur, bland taste... just very very poor.Don't go there - no other advice would do justice to this place."
French,Paul,Breakfast ,-1,10,26-Aug-17,"Very long waiting time!! ... as more and more in Singapore
The staff is good and doing his best. Mist probably a Management issue.
Don't go!"
French,Paul,Poor service,-1,20,9-Aug-17,"We enjoy trying out different cafes around Singapore, and this place has got one of the worst service crew around. What a shame considering the food is actually fairly decent.One particular male staff (could not capture the name but tall and large build) has one of the poorest attitude ever. We were seated for 10mins without being served, so we raised we raised our hands to send him a signal, and got a stonecold look from him. When we were placing our order, he was inpatient and rude throughout.Then, a lady in the next table asked the same staff of her food, he got very defensive in explaining ""everyone is very busy, so you have to wait"". Eventually the lady was served with a rather grumpy look. We could hear the entire conversation plainly because the staff was loud in his response to that poor lady."
French,Paul,Just got to laugh,-1,20,7-Aug-17,Went to Pauls Paragon for coffee and cake.The cakes and sandwiches looked great!Sadly thats where the excitement ended.The service is really laughable. In the end i had to just go up to the counter as getting table service was non existent. Tea came with no milk. After going up and asking for milk waited 10 minutes and still no milk. Had to get up again and go look for it.Got told scolded by one of the staff members for moving tables. Even though another staff member helped us move tables and even reset the table for us.Sadly the experience was so bad - you just gotta laugh.At least it was memorable ...more like a visit to Faulty Towers.Nice cup if tea at least! And nice place to sit. And my french pastry was nice.Visit at your own peril. Helps to have no service expectation. Pastries were good.
French,Paul,The Food is the Saving Grace ,-1,20,30-Jul-17,"Located on the 3rd floor of the building, this world-famous bakery/cafe is easily accessible. Indoor and outdoor seats are available.The 3-course set dinner is value for money and the portion sizes are adequate, so kudos to the chef and kitchen team. On the service side, things could greatly be improved.Firstly, the wait staff could be friendlier and offer a smile when showing us to the table. Secondly, the set dinner soup was pumpkin but I overhead later that it was finished and replaced with tomato. No one thought to inform us of the change. Thirdly, the wait for the main course was almost half an hour. We had to signal the staff to bring out the mains. They could have taken notice and apologised for the wait, both of which was expected but none of which was done.Luckily, the food was the saving grace, but we will think twice before dining here again."
French,Paul,Poor Quality / Below par Service,-1,10,21-Jul-17,"The service of this Paul outlet is below par. I don't fault the service personnel but the management of the establishment for not providing sufficient training for their staff. Ordered Magret de Canard - Medium. And it came well done. Can you imagine duck breast well done? Tasted like pieces of leather. Fail. And the gratin: burnt. Another fail. The sauce, too thick and starchy; tasted more like gravy. They do dress up their failure with lots of salad over the top though. The mains were also not serve at the same time to the table. My colleague waited more than 30mins for her grill fish. No one came to inform us of the delay. Only upon several prompting did they finally serve the dish. Avoid this outlet at all cost!! "
French,Paul,Waiters that behave like headless chickens,-1,10,6-Jul-17,"This restaurant in Paragon should just close down. For me, good food goes with good service because I'm paying for the bill that includes a service charge. I've never been to a so-called restaurant where the service was so atrocious. The waiters were rude and arrogant. The menu looks great but so what when you don't even get served in the first place? Why is it with some of the reviews about their terrible service that this restaurant still continues to operate? The previous restaurant Begazin, was one of the most efficient restaurants we've ever been to. It was nice stopping by for a cup of coffee especially with its great location next to Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. It's shameful in a country like Singapore where efficiency is paramount that this business continues to exist."
French,Paul,Worst cafe experience ever,-1,10,25-Jun-17,"Very difficult to catch the waiters attention to take orders, get the bill, etc... get completely ignored, even when sitting in front of them. Food and drinks are alright but not worth the price given the bad service."
French,Paul,Very disappointing,-1,20,22-Jun-17,"Looks good, but service was really slow and the pastries not that great. A real disappointment as it looked promising."
French,Paul,Worst restaurant in Orchard road,-1,10,13-Jun-17,"We had afternoon tea time at the paragon outlet. There were only 3 tables occupied and already been served. We ordered pancake and sandwich. We waited 40 min for our food , our coffee were lukewarm and diluted. Waiters were not interested even if we waved and called 'excuse me'. This is my worst experience in Singapore, bad service and food quality."
French,Paul,Too long,-1,30,8-Jun-17,"Our third visit to this place, and this time we waited almost 25 minutes for our beverages. End of the story ?"
French,Paul,Pretentious,-1,30,4-Jun-17,"Went to grab a bite after some shopping, and was throughly disappointed by the service and more important the quality of the food served. For a patisserie, the bread and desert tasted pretty poor , average at best. Service was remarkably poor with staff not cleaning the previous dishes before serving the next one , even more disappointing as I prompted them.... When I got in, most of the tables were empty, but it seemed to fill shortly after with lots of families with children You would expect better service as this is not a cheap place If in the area I would look for better options "
French,Paul,Afternoon tea break ,-1,20,3-Jun-17,"Was looking for a rest point in the middle of my shopping and came to Paul's at Ngee Ann City. The tarts was marvellous, we ordered the lemon, raspberry and chocolate flavoured. The lemon tart is slightly sweet with a tangy sourish after taste and was the first to be gobbled up by my kids. Next was the custardy raspberry tart, the custard filling was just right and not too sweet with a generous serving of raspberries on TOP. The Chocolaterie tart was quite thick but good. The cappuccino however was a tad too milky, can't really taste the coffee. The ice lemon tea was ok and nothing much to rave about. The food overall was good with. 3.5/5 stars but the disappointment was the lack of service. Every order we had, the food came without cutlery. The drinks took forever to arrive including a bottled drink which we felt doesn't take much effort to prepare. We ordered a serving of fries and the request for The ketchup did not even arrive even after we have finished. I would recommend a take away cos the place doesn't deserved charging its customers for any service charge. "
French,Paul,Food is very good but slow service. ,-1,20,20-May-17,"ambiance is very nice. relaxing. but could have been better if they play some french music. Food is sooo good. we tried salad grilled beef and beef tartine.I ordered this chocolate drink topped with whip cream @ $7.90. I requested for it to be served cold. but it was not served with whipped cream.it looks different from the picture on the menu and nothing special on the taste. the server insisted that it does not have a whipped cream. but how come it says on the menu. and when I asked for the whip cream. i was charged additional $1.50, it should have been included on the 7.90 as its stated on the menu!! on top of that I was charged additional $2 because it was served cold and I was not informed when I ordered. I was so upset. i will keep coming back to paul as I like the food but im not coming back to this branch. i dont recommend. try other branch."
French,Paul,"Great place for coffee, crepes and eclairs but the service is poor",-1,30,19-May-17,"I like the eclairs, crepes and salads but the service is slow, often irritating. It tends to get busy due to the location. Great for takeaway and I love the caprese panini (tomato and mozzarella). I think it's an old favourite boulangerie and patisserie."
French,Paul,Bad Service,-1,10,18-May-17,"I have been to Paul three times and all those three times has been unpleasant.
Seems like the staffs are always busy and ignored customers, although there are not many customers at that moment."
French,Paul,First visit to this outlet,-1,20,13-May-17,"let down from its name sake. well known in the cafe industry with outlets across the island, this outlet was so poorly staffed and managed and the manager staff who finally showed us a table did not even smile once at all not to us alone but to all who were there. "
French,Paul,Badly Managed ,-1,10,10-May-17,"We waited for almost an hour for a cup of coffee, and our frappe did not even arrive because there was a ""shortage of glasses"""
French,Paul,Slow service/food served,-1,20,7-May-17,"Chipped teapot sprout. Took forever for food to be served and for a request of an additional tea set which eventually didn't come. I don't know, you tell me, I would expect better. Perhaps they need more manpower to run this. I need to commend on this hardworking spectacled server i observed though, he was trying to tend to the many customers as he could. Definitely need more manpower."
French,Paul,Worst service,-1,10,1-May-17,"The service level is not what you would expect from Paul. The outlet at Takashimaya is great, but the staff at Paragon are inattentive, unhelpful and slow. What made my visit worse was that two of the staff started having a heated argument right inside the cafe, all the while ignoring me when I was trying to place my order. At least have the professionalism to have internal arguments at the back of house, not where it is in display to all the customers."
French,Paul,Not what I expect from this chain,-1,20,22-Apr-17,Having been to a Paul restaurant several times I thought I knew what I was getting but this experience has left me very disappointed.The service was very slow and we were first served flat Coke which we asked to be replaced. We then had an extra Coke added to our bill. One member of our party was served their main first and had finished by the time everyone else had received their meals. We chose to have a chocolate cake which has to be the worst chocolate cake I've ever ordered at a restaurant. So bad that we didn't finish it. Not to mention it was served upside down on a plate and we were given no cutlery to eat it with. We then had to wait a very long time for the sever to deal with our payment which seemed to take a long time after we had given over our credit card. Very disappointed and I now know I can't rely on this chain to offer good food and good service. 
French,Paul,Doesn't make the grade..,-1,30,17-Apr-17,"Paul at Takashiyama, SingaporeHad lunch here. Paul in Singapore, pretends to be a restaurant in its decor and furnishing but the bites served here are the French version of ""le pret-e-manger"" or fast-food +. The crepe Suzette my wife ordered was below average. . Overall I wouldn't rate it more than average. The service was not what one would expect in a restaurant charging the prices it does."
French,Paul,Not up to the usual Paul standard,-1,20,12-Apr-17,"Took a coffee, sandwich and cake at this venue. The quality of sandwich and cakes was not up to the usual Paul high standards. Sandwich bread was hard and stale, cakes were dated and past their best by date. Disappointing visit. The staff were also unfriendly and not attentive. Needless to say that the prices are very, very expensive but hen again this is Singapore !"
French,Paul,Abysmal breakfast,-1,10,11-Apr-17,"The omelette was not cooked through and the sausage cold. It was served on a cold plate and we had waited ages for it. We told the waiter about it expecting him to take it off our bill or reduce it as I didn't eat it, but said he didn't understand and ignored us. Don't go there unless you want to wait a long time for food that should be hot but isn't and served on cold plates."
French,Paul,Normal Fruit Tart,-1,30,26-Mar-17,"Its my first time trying the fruit tart at Paul and I expect myself to go hoo haa, raving on how buttery and tasty the fruit tart was. Unfortunately, it falls under my expectation for a fruit tart. Of course, the nicest part of the tart was just the fruits, fresh and sweet.Outlet: Westgate (not able to locate Paul Westgate on tripadvisor, thus posting the review here)"
French,Paul,"Mediocre service , more than average food ",-1,10,26-Mar-17,"Went for lunch today to get quick bite , service staff should get trained or change they're job ! The food I ordered white and cheese sandwich with I think it's really basic , it was served cut in 2 Mc hot and with some horrible salade ( see pic) Won't go back and will not encourage people to go This is institutional in france or even in Japan but here is nothing "
French,Paul,"Lousy steak, horrible service. Avoid if possible",-1,10,24-Mar-17,"Ordered tenderloin steak. Taste horrible. I could get better steak at cheaper price elsewhere.What is even worse is the service and attitude of one staff who served us.We selected some pastries from the pastry counter to be served later. However, they first said that pastries ordered at counter is for take away only (when i been here few months ago and ordered from counter to have it at the table). Then, after checking at counter, they didn't know what we ordered. Lousy food and service.Will never patronise Paul restaurant again."
French,Paul,Typical Breakfast Fare without the Hipster Queues,-1,30,12-Mar-17,"I have visited Paul bakery a number of times with family and friends. They have a reliable stable of food options. The quality of food options are great, but not amazing. Their menu is rather pricey for the quality of food, but that is understandable since it is a foreign ""upmarket-ish"" kind of chain.My usual go-to's for a French breakfast are croissants or Pain Au Chocolat. On this occasion, I ordered a Pain Au Chocolat and a Palmier. The Pain Au Chocolat is lackluster and the DIY frozen options from the Tanglin Food Market taste way better. The Palmier is reminiscent of Tiong Bahru Bakery's Kouign Amann. It was good, flakey and buttery, but I very much prefer the Kouign Amann, although they are two different items.Overall, Paul is a good option if one wants a breakfast without the hype and crowd of a hipster place."
French,Paul,More interested in dealing with deliveroo orders than serving customers,-1,20,4-Mar-17,"Orchard road branch. A disorganised service team, a manager who spent more time answering online orders than monitoring the status of the restaurant. We were not the only unhappy customers. The food is tasty but the service is worse than it was the last time I went four years ago. Use the take out counter, avoid dining in less reason for disappointment. "
French,Paul,Nice place,-1,30,28-Feb-17,"Just looking for coffee, nice place to go, but service took ages and some people say the menu's overpriced."
French,Paul,Afternoon Tea,-1,30,26-Feb-17,"For our afternoon tea of today, we decided to go to Paul Cafe at Takashimaya Shopping Mall, Orchard Road, Singapore. Location-wise, it is easily reachable.Paul Cafe originated from France and in Singapore it is located at Level 3 Takashimaya Mall.Customers come in numbers, so prior booking probably advisable.Since it was fully booked, we decided instead to do take-aways. Services were quick and servers were also responsive.For a croissant, a madelaine, a pain au chocolat, and a ""sugar pizza"" we paid SingDol 13.70. I would argue it's reasonable, quality being taken into consideration.The surroundings were also nice and practically while sipping your tea or coffee you could observe the bustling Orchard Road.The cakes tasted good, classic European. I really enjoyed its choco pain.Overall rating is 3/5 as restrooms aren't available inside the establishment."
French,Paul,Overpriced ,-1,20,10-Feb-17,Looking for a coffee and sat here. I was prepared to pay $6 for a coffee and while we were there saw lovely smoked salmon baguettes for $7 so ordered two. When we received the bill those same baguettes were charged at $15 each plus 10%service plus GST. We questioned the cost and we were told that the prices in the window were for take away with eat in costing double. It would have been nice to know!Overrated food and coffee. Not recommended. 
French,Paul,Overpriced,-1,20,5-Feb-17,"Food was average at best. Chocolate tart was the only decent thing. Iced coffee was comparable to Nescafé 3in1 coffee.
Won't return again"
French,Paul,Food was decent but service a disaster!,-1,10,23-Jan-17,"Went for late lunch around 4pm in the afternoon. Only about 4 tables including us. Lady Staff who sat us looks really ""not in the mood today"". But I looked past that since this is the norm in Singapore these days. The male staff serving our table simply made me felt like I was dining in a funeral parlor. Avoided eye contact while serving and just brought the plate to our table without a word expecting us to make a space for him to dump the plate so he can go off. After we were done, he preferred to loiter around shifting forks on empty table than to clear our table. Big turn off and lost my appetite for dessert. When I asked for the bill, the lady just passed me the bill with dessert included. I told her I didn't get any dessert and she should remove it from billed. She just took the bill, cancel it then passed me the updated bill without asking or bothering what happened to he dessert. I will never step in here again and it is utterly disgusting for Paul to include service charge if this is the kind of staff that they can put in the front line. "
French,Paul,Waste of time,-1,10,12-Jan-17,"Too much pretense! Service took ages, and the quality of simple breakfast was not good. To add insult to injury the coffee is really bad! It looks nice, but avoid; the are so many good breakfast places to go to as alternative."
French,Paul,"Nice food for a shopping mall, but a staff a bit chaotic",-1,30,11-Jan-17,"We ate at Paul in the Ngee Ann City complex on two occasions. The food was surprisingly good for a shopping mall restaurant. We shared a baguette with chicken and salad, with excellent fruit smoothies to drink. The desserts were also very good. However, the staff at the restaurant seem to be run off their feet, even mid afternoon. Whether this is due to lack of proper training or coordination, or understaffing is not clear. It was hard to get waitress' attention to procure a table, order, or pay the bill, and orders seemed to be lost or mixed up some of the time. This restaurant is still worth visiting if you are on a shopping expedition, but it could be so much better if properly managed"
French,Paul,It was okay,-1,30,3-Jan-17,"Got a coffee and some dessert, it was pretty average and very pricey for what it was. Coffee was mediocre and cakes were nothing fantastic. Good ambiance and service but food served was just boring."
French,Paul,Decent food but chaotic service,-1,20,2-Jan-17,"The pros : classical Paul products The cons : is there someone managing this restaurant ? All staff seem to be running around without any coordination. Tables aren't cleared quickly, causing people to queue even with tables available (albeit not clean). Delivery after order is erratic at best, water was delivered after main dish was eaten !"
French,Paul,Defines horrendous,-1,10,1-Jan-17,"This local franchise of the ubiquitous French chain is truly horrendous. Known in France for reliable quality fare, here the brand is going to hell. Firstly, the service is slow and gives new meaning to the word inattentive. A table next to us was heard speculating if they should just leave without paying because getting a bill was taking so long. We also waited forever to be served and to receive our orders, all at a time when the place was far from busy. Then there's what passes for food -- soggy inedible macarons, a moelleux that was stale, hard and dry (the antithesis of the meaning of the cake), and one of the worst cappuccino's I've ever had (how does one mess this up!?), I could go on... It's hard to put a finger on what exactly is wrong here. Is it lack of proper management, is it a belief that a well known brand can prevail over thoroughly mediocre product? Whatever it is, the succession of accurate and bad reviews here should be a wake up call to pull up their socks. And prices are not exactly bon marché. All it has going for it is the location and view."
French,Paul,Promises Promises,-1,30,1-Jan-17,"Busy, understaffed, SLOW service.....the coffee was off, the meringues were hard and SOGGY, the matcha frappe was oversweet and odd, and you have to ASK, and ASK for a glass of water. Food does not show and any questioning is answered...you are in the queue. Indeed.Try somewhere else. The promise of standards like Paul elsewhere is...where?"
French,Paul,Awful food. Not worth a penny,-1,10,31-Dec-16,Bakery to go maybe ok. But the food is totally crab. Food doesnt look like what was described in the menu and look awful when it landed on table. Cheesy food and not even french nor western. It seems that the outlet has come with its own interpretation as to prepare it. Purist beware! My recommendation. Pls do not waste ur money except u purely eat the bakery. Dont try anything else which are totally horrible.
French,Paul,Bad bakes ,-1,10,31-Dec-16,"Horrible bakes, over priced... When there for breakfast, regretted big time... because food TOTALLY SUCKS!"
French,Paul,"Overpriced, Over-rated and terrible",-1,10,30-Dec-16,"The header simply says it all. I was with the wife. We have had a long day of christmas shopping. And we were there on a not so busy weekday afternoon.So, no crowd, no one in line for seats, not even packed. In fact, it was fairly empty. We found a table we liked, and told the waitress. It took them 10 minutes to clear and clean the table. Ok ok ok ok... 10 minutes .. I am too demanding you say. My wife went to the display glass cabinet to look at the 'sumptious pastries and other deli offerings' . I sat, and waited for the waiting staff to come back and provide menu. I was thirsty and wanted to at least order a drink while awaiting for my wife to come back to the table. I look around, no staff. Finally saw 2 of them walking around. And I waved my hand, but it seems like I was invisible. Finally after I stood up and walked towards them, they noticed me. I am surprised. Not even a crowded afternoon, and it seems like they were not wanting to have eye contact with the patrons. I saw an elderly couple also (like me) waving for their attention. Oh well, maybe my hand was short, and maybe my skin complexion blended into the background and they didnt notice me.So I ordered 2 coffees, 1 capuccino. I waited for about 30 minutes before the coffee came (and it was LUKEWARM). I asked the waitress to change the coffee for me as i told them it was not even hot. It must have been sitting on the counter for awhile. We ordered a sandwhich, of which I couldn't be bothered to remember now because it tasted dry and horrible. Overall conclusion, give this place a miss. Terrible service, poor quality food."
French,Paul,"Bad service, overpriced, poor preparation of food",-1,10,28-Dec-16,"Bad service, unattentive, and poor food. Slightly better than MacDonald
Dont go. Not worth it. Go to subway."
French,Paul,Ridiculous seating,-1,10,23-Dec-16,"Went to the outlet at MBFC link mall for lunch where they served reasonably priced lunch sets. My colleague and I were showed to a tiny round table fitted into a right corner of the wall with hardly any leg room for both of us. I am super furious and gave the staff a stern short lecture that I felt embarrassed for PAUL for even thinking of putting a table there for customers. These days seriously, it is clearly revenue over service even for old renowned retail establishments like PAUL. Will never visit again till they clean up their act. A great pity and a big black stain on PAUL's reputation. Hope their parent company revoke this franchise rights!!!"
French,Paul,Nice cafe w a good location but the service is sad,-1,30,22-Dec-16,"The brand and location attracts shoppers to stop for drink and bite. Place is nice , food is the norm. However, the service is really making me think twice about coming back here. Either this outlet is super under staff or they just are so busy and worn out look.. - there are empty tables but yet they took a long time to find seats for the patrons in the q - I had to actively look out for staff and asked 3staffs before order is taken- slow in taking order- slow in serving the beverage and cake -both plates actually are pretty worn out with stains on them  Perhaps they can have service staff to just serve some ice water/ warm water and let the guests know they be with them in a min to take order.. conclusion is Come if u got a lot of time to just wait and wait"
French,Paul,Awful service,-1,20,19-Dec-16,"We had lunch there, ordered a baguette and a burger. The baguette was old, I almost lost a tooth trying to eat that. The burger was good. They brought our beverages almost when we were finishing our food (after we complained twice). No apologies and no smiles. It took them another 15 minutes to bring me back the menu for some dessert.I wouldn't recommend it. I've been to other Paul's in other countries and they were great, but this one was a complete shame."
French,Paul,"Good food, appalling service",-1,20,18-Dec-16,"It seemed a good place to stop and enjoy a typically French snack and coffee. In a way it was. The coffee, tarte au citron and crepe were authentic. But OH DEAR, the service in Singapore is usually exemplar, not here! . We were left waiting to sit down as nobody seemed interested. Then we waited about 20 mins for coffee and longer for food. The same went for the bill. Then my Visa card disappeared for at least 10 minutes while they took it for payment. No smiles, no acknowledgement and hence, no tip. Shame, good food!"
French,Paul,Was better before & overpriced.,-1,10,10-Dec-16,"The service really got worse. We have been waiting for a glass of wine for half an hour. Even after 3 reminders still nothing happened. When I informed the manager, the staff even complained ""...we do not have a wine glass, what can I do, is it my problem...?"". Also there was a family first in line of the waiting-que when 3 girls just passed them by, came inside and the staff gives them a table... how can that be? Because this staff was playing with the mobile phone and didn't recognize that the family was first... mamamia..."
French,Paul,Busy at times average coffee,-1,30,23-Nov-16,"At times there are long queues, likely due to position and exposure. Nice layout area however the coffee taste average. Good place to park a moment in between shopping."
French,Paul,bad service,-1,20,19-Nov-16,"i personally dont come to a restaurant just to eat but also i come for the experience and service, which this place has lack of. most of the waiter were so obnoxious, especially the one who serve us (young local guy with thick framed glasses). the food is just okay for the price, not perfect and a bit pricey for what the serve."
French,Paul,"Great for breakfast and coffee, but...",-1,30,19-Oct-16,"Had tried Paul before for coffee and breakfasts before, and certainly their croissants are excellent (if you get them early in the morning when they are freshly-baked), but a recent visit for lunch was somewhat disappointing. If I remember correctly they used to have a pretty good lunch set in the past. But that is gone now. The food is still okay but it's quite pricey for what it is. Though if you want a quick place to grab a decent lunch - even a causal business one - its still okay. "
French,Paul,Love this restaurant but not in Singapore ,-1,20,15-Oct-16,So this is my second visit a Paul restaurant. The first in paragon. I waited 25 mins for a simple cappuccino and the second here in ngee Ann city. My ears are still sore. Please tell the staff to life the chairs and tables or else put piece of felt on the bottom. It is so sore on my ears. Some of the staff are au fait with what is going on. The rest forget it. The salad was dressed beautifully however. 
French,Paul,Good Selection of Pastry and Sweets,-1,30,23-Sep-16,My friends and I have some pastry and sweets for dessert as a take away after our dinner in Ngee Ann City.Some of the food that we had are the chocolate eclair and chocolate mousse. The food are packed nicely into boxes to take home.Taste of the food are of acceptable standard. As the sweetness and pastry are done nicely.
French,Paul,Ok food but useless staff!,-1,20,23-Sep-16,"Stopped by here for lunch with a girlfriend. We ordered 2 glasses of champagne to sip whilst deciding on what to eat. The waiter informed us that they didn't serve champagne, only beer! I ordered a cappuccino and my friend opted for tea. We started to browse the menu and surprise surprise, champagne by the bottle or the glass. We called over the same writer & showed him the menu, he looked very vague and said he would see if they had any.The champagne arrived, hooray! The food was fine, nothing exceptional but it was ok.I wouldn't bother visiting again due to the waiting staff who really should grasp the knowledge of what is on offer on the menu - it's not even a vast menu! I guess you get what you pay for & suspect this establishment pay a very basic salary & therefore attract total muppets, shame."
French,Paul,Terrible service and ordinary food at Paragon outlet ,-1,20,22-Sep-16,"This review is for the outlet at Paragon mall, which is not in TripAdvisor. Terrible service, we ordered an omelette and a cold sandwich when we arrived and amazingly, the omelette arrived first. I even had the time to eat it before the sandwich arrived, and that was very bland and fairly ordinary. Otoh, the fresh lemonade is really sour and refreshing.The waiting staff are pretty useless and various patrons were constantly having to wave them to their tables to correct mistakes with their orders. Will definitely avoid."
French,Paul,Paul is my fail-safe place. But in SIngapore we were let down.,-1,20,13-Sep-16,"I had to ask for the complimentary bread basket, which is otherwise promptly given at Paul, everytime. This was my first visit to Paul in Singapore.Even the food we ordered wasn't upto the mark. Took an unduly long time for the food to arrive. The waiter made a mistake in placing the order. Everything that can go wrong, went wrong that day!But I will still remain a Paul fan."
French,Paul,Service could be better,-1,30,12-Sep-16,"I was at Paul @ Westgate with some friends. This was my second attempt to dine here. When I came here the first time, it was for a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't crowded. However, we couldn't manage to get the attention of the staff to place our order. After a while, we left and went to another place to have lunch. This time around, it also took us a while to get the staff's attention despite waving at them and raising our hands to get their attention. We ordered the all-day set. When I asked the staff if they serve hot beverages, she curtly said ""No"". I knew the set came with iced tea but I was hoping I could upgrade and pay a little more for a coffee because I know Paul does serve coffee. Unfortunately, the staff was only interested to taking the set order without any variations. Food was ok and portions were good given that it was a set meal. Unfortunately, I noticed that customers on other tables also had a hard time getting the staff's attention. I noticed that several reviewers here also commented on the service. Perhaps this is something Paul's management should take note of and work on improving its service so as to enhance the overall dining experience for its customers."
French,Paul,Ordered food never arrived inspite of reminders,-1,20,7-Sep-16,I had visitors from London and took them around 3 pm for a cake and coffe to PaulsWe ordered our drinks and a few dishes. The waitress repeated the order twice and then left.The dishes my visitors ordered arrived. I had ordered a hot chocolate and a croissant.It was over 45 mins and I had not received anything. I nudged a waiter who was passing by and said that I had ordered a hot chocolate and a croissant. Soon enough my hot chocolate arrived. I waited another half an hour and asked the same waiter again and he said my croissant was on the way. Another 15 mins went by and it was well past 4.30 pm and I could wait no longer. I asked for the bill . When the bill arrived I told the waitress that my croissant never arrived inspite of several reminders. She then ran in and got me the croissant.I could not eat it and just left. Very disappointing service- Infact they were not even busy
French,Paul,Bad service ,-1,10,14-Aug-16,Very Bad and slow service i was waiting for my toast 45 minutes. and very expensive prices.I Think all Pauls work this unfortunate way.
French,Paul,Arrogant and Rude Service,-1,10,6-Aug-16,"Was at the Paul's outlet in Marina Bay ( I did not want to even add the place to Trip Advisor). Service crew there was really not interested to do business. Food was so so and the soup really too sweet. There were no baby chairs and it seemed as though they did not know what they were doing. When the kid with us was babbling , they gave dirty looks and shook their heads especially the manageress. Was disgusted with this level of service so we we paid and left without finishing the food - just lost our appetite. I give this the worse rating I've ever given to a food outlet ( never thought it would be a Paul's outlet though) - ZERO thumbs out of Five.... AVOID EATING HERE !!Honestly if you don't have the crew business, please stop expanding cos you just lost credibility with me and my friends. "
French,Paul,Poor Service,-1,10,9-Jul-16,Went for afternoon tea. Not happy with the service as the waiter seemed to be in a bad mood and it showed in his facial expression and actions. Was rude while serving as well as clearing our table. Will not return nor recommend to others.
French,Paul,Paul @ Tanglin Mall: Service needs improvement,-1,30,4-Jul-16,"We decided to go to Paul at Tanglin Mall for brunch on Mother's Day. Being a family of 3 (2 adults and a baby), we didn't book and didn't need to as there were tables available. We ordered a croque madam, eggs, and waffles for dessert. Strangely, the dessert arrived first followed by the croque madam. My husbands savory dish didn't arrive till 10 minutes after the first dish so we weren't too impressed with the lack of coordination of dishes. We also had to get the attention of the wait staff a few times to ask for a second spoon for the dessert, milk for our tea and to enquire about the timing of arrival of my husbands dish. Overall, while the food was good, I wouldn't choose to return unless the service shows some improvement. "
French,Paul,Sunday tea,-1,20,20-Jun-16,"A nice cafe for a late lunch. The sautéed mushrooms on French potato pancake was good, but the same can't be said for the pastries. Service staff was a tad non-chalant bordering arrogant. Given the many choices of premium cafes in Paragon, we will give Paul a miss the next time."
French,Paul,Long waiting...,-1,10,7-Jun-16,My last try... And definitely poor service. We have tried a few times and decided no longer coming back due to quality of service.
French,Paul,"Hate to say it, but I much prefer the Starbucks next door",-1,30,18-May-16,"Less than ordinary coffee, ordinary service, reasonable Danish pastry, high prices. Title of review says it all really."
French,Paul,Preserved long-life UHT milk used in Paul's coffee?,-1,20,16-May-16,"When we visited the outlet, the coffee tasted odd, which we later found to be caused by the use of UHT rather fresh milk. We asked the staff about it, but they said they were instructed by their management to use UHT (we're guessing it's because it's cheaper).But they charge coffee at premium prices, so why use cheap, preserved milk? So don't expect a nice-tasting cuppa from Pauls. Resign yourself to that horrible aftertaste of UHT milk."
French,Paul,Food is good but service is poor. Expect to have to chase them to serve you.,-1,30,15-May-16,"The menu is quite good and similar to cafe styles found in Paris. Food itself is tasty and presented well. Great location and comfortable seating. However the service here is virtually non-existent, the staff seemed to have been trained not to make eye contact at all. They breeze past your table not seeming to notice you are trying hard to get someones attention. Getting the bill is a challenge, you literally need to stand and start leaving to spur anyone into action. Overpriced but not for the food or location just the service is really well below what you would expect for a premium location."
French,Paul,Don't bother,-1,10,7-May-16,"As per other reviews, the service is so poor and to add insult to injury, on advising the staff that we'd been waiting for a long time with only one meal placed before us, they were rude! I noted that it took less than thirty seconds for the bill to come out. Will find an establishment that is happy about my custom next time. "
French,Paul,Completely forgot my order,-1,10,30-Apr-16,"Waited for more than half an hour. Other tables that came after me was served. Really disappointed. No apologies, they just go about their business. Not recommend to any of my friends.
Sickening to the core. Made my visit very unpleasant."
French,Paul,very average,-1,20,25-Apr-16,"been to few paul beside singapore.. here is no service
have to call the staff couple of times
food was ok but typica other paul
in the area there are other venue that much better.."
French,Paul,Zero customer service,-1,10,23-Apr-16,Service staff need to be trained how to manage customers. 7 customers served by 3 staff - completely indifferent and rude. Had to walk out.
French,Paul,Pathetic service!,-1,10,15-Apr-16,"Rude, grumpy, inattentive staff who act like they are doing you a favour. They are gruff. I had to ask 4 times for ice water and they still did not bring it! In exasperation I went and helped myself. The waiter did not know what a flute was-which is part of their breakfast choices.Later, when they served the omellette they forgot the bread!They don't ask if you want anything else.The lady working behind the bar making coffees and juices and serving out the pastries to wait staff is wearing 6 inch heels! Any wonder the coffee takes forever.Ridiculos service-on par with the other sub standard service at Paul's Takeshimaya.ps. The restaurant is not full!"
French,Paul,"Average food, high prices, poor service ",-1,20,3-Apr-16,"Moody staff. The kind that greets you as if in pain for giving them more job to do. Waiting to order, two waitresses passing by rushing answered me with ""hold on!, eh?"" ""Gimme a minute! Eh?"". You should train your staff to answer ""one moment please"" (while smiling) not difficult to do so. Upon ordering coffee with macaroni we were told that macaroni flavors are upon availability, meaning, we cannot choose. Can there be more non-sense? The food was ok but overpriced."
French,Paul,Check your salad for big bugs!,-1,10,28-Mar-16,"Last Sunday my wife and I had lunch at Paul in Ngee Ann City. We have eaten there maybe 15-20 times in the past already, and although the experience has been mixed, we keep coming back because of the European-styled menu and foods. However, this time was really different. To make a long story short, there was a gigantic insect in the salad my wife had ordered. She had already started the salad and only noticed the big bug when she was about to eat it... needless to say she didn't want any other salad. The staff apologized and said that they buy their salad from an external party and that the Paul staff should have washed it more thoroughly. Anyway, we were both disgusted and after having another dish and a small dessert, we left and will never eat a salad there again. I mean, they prepare this nice salad with vinaigrette and all, really nicely presented on your plate, and they didn't notice the big bug??? So the lowest possible score for this visit. So sad for their reputation, but this has to be the worst thing that can happen in a restaurant."
French,Paul,"Poor Service, Poor Product",-1,20,27-Mar-16,"Went to the Paul cafe at Paragon - staff were poor, had to keep chasing to get order. Bring cakes but no drinks, then eventually bring drinks after finished our cakes, then have to ask for milk for the tea...can't even do the basics right! The food and drinks were also poor, so all round it wasn't good and won't be back to this cafe again!"
French,Paul,Small portions,-1,30,22-Mar-16,"Portions are rather small and not very appetizing as what one pays for it. Strange that the recipes and food quality are not the same as in other countries. Service is nothing to talk about it .
Such a shame ."
French,Paul,Not bad ,-1,30,19-Mar-16,"There is not much to choose from their menu for me . I love multi fruit smoothies , sugar tart and Cesar salad from Paul , but I don't like the rest of my order ."
French,Paul,It's a shame ,-1,10,15-Mar-16,I tried this outlet many times. The quality of food is really bad. Either the food is cold or the waffles hard and the coffee is a nightmare.
French,Paul,Average!,-1,30,14-Mar-16,"Have tried Paul in London/Bangkok, hence will not skip a try in Paul Singapore Ngee Ann City just for a cuppa. But, a little disappointed, staff not so attentive. Order hot mocha, not at a great temperature, too hot. Macaroons were good."
French,Paul,Reputation is not enough...,-1,20,12-Mar-16,"Come on guys. Sitting there, alone, for 15 min, looking in the eyes of staff members at least 20 times, no coffee, no food, waiting to order - and yet no one (!!!) is asking what I need or if I want to order anything. Coffee is good and pastries are even better - very good. But as long as the service is cold and not friendly a cafe is can't be a good cafe. Cafe is an overall experience and this one failed. Even just a small cup of water or, better, a little smile, could grant a third star."
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and snacks ,-1,30,8-Mar-16,"Located on the 3 rd level of Ngee Ann City .
Good place to rest and relax after shopping
Service is prompt
Coffee is nice
Nice ambience
Like any other places in Singapore for coffee and snacks"
French,Paul,Not going back there,-1,10,27-Feb-16,"I was not amused by the bad service in the first place, but even the quality of the food (breakfast) was extremely sub standard. What do people like on this place? You sit in the poor ambiance of a shopping mall chewing on an uncooked waffle, sipping fresh juice which contains 60% ice cubes, or a cappuccino without even the taste of coffee.I visited ""Paul"" in Jakarta as well, and out there they know what service is, great quality of food and good ambiance. Maybe the singaporean branch should go for a week training in Jakarta how the job could (should) be done."
French,Paul,Overrated and poor service,-1,20,25-Feb-16,"Was quite disappointed with the service at Paul. The waiters seem To be disorganised and didn't pay attention much to our needs from the moment we had to sit to our order. We ordered salmon salad which was so so an then had to wait almost an hour for our waffle order to appear (was good but maybe because we were so hungry by then). Not sure what happened because we kept asking about it and the waiter checked, then we asked a couple times and he said it is gonna take 5 min more and do we mind waiting (???)"
French,Paul,"Undercooked, tasteless and doughy crepe champignon (Ocean Financial Centre branch)",-1,20,24-Feb-16,"Ordered two mushroom crepes,they came out undercooked and tasteless and badly presented. The crepes were more like thick layers of undercooked flour, with very little mushrooms and cheese. Disappointing and extremely overpriced meal."
French,Paul,Paul (Westgate) - service has improved,-1,30,23-Feb-16,"It has been a long while since we last went to Paul at Westgate Mall at Jurong East, after experiencing bad service more than once. So we were pleasantly surprised when both the waitresses were actually friendly and smiley when we had dinner there last night, although service was still slow. Seems the bad reviews did work! The food was not bad, although the serving size could be slightly bigger, especially for the soup. The grilled chicken and baked sea bass were tasty. The dessert was bread pudding, which was apparently very popular but was so so only. "
French,Paul,What is Happening Currently,-1,30,20-Feb-16,"It is indeed sad that a cafe of this reputation is not able to keep up to the expectations of customers. With the shortage of labour every food and beverage establishment is facing, it does not seem like improvements to the lack of quality service are going to happen anytime soon. What a shame.Despite the situation, we have always wanted to try out this name brand since we missed the opportunity back when we were in Paris a few years ago. Now that we have, we are somewhat satisfied.The queue did not take long to subside and we got to sit at a table along the passageway. We could peer through the glass panel straight at the cash register. Perhaps it would be wise to have a ceiling-to-wall curtain to block off the view from customers. The menu was comprehensive and had photos to aid the customers and the portions are fairly large for their prices. My partner and I had a turkey ham and cheese sandwich to share and ordered separate mains. Desserts are the highlights here and we ordered the strawberry mille-feuille, light and fluffy. Sweet endings!"
French,Paul,"Poor service, and so so food",-1,20,14-Feb-16,"I wonder what is the fuss about this place with the long queue? Decent place, but so so quality food and quite non existence services, left this place much to desire. Will not return."
French,Paul,couldn't have lunch :(,-1,10,9-Feb-16,"true story worst experience ever . we sat with husband and d 3 kids at Paul Paragon ( restaurant half full) . waiting time to to be seated 10 minutes , to get a menu 10 more minutes . To have a waiter looking at us 10 more . finally , and that the comic part , one lost waiter among many comes to our table and say "" let me talk to the chef , i am not sure to place your order (12:30 pm ) ... 10 more minutes waiting ... waiter comes back and informs us that waiting time is 30 minutes .. we say ok but please take our order now . my husband orders 2 omelettes , cannot finish talking and waiter replies , let me talk to the chef ...seriously , why ?... and comes back , well 35 minutes .. if I were you i woud go somewhere else he says ... best part now , we are preparing to leave , hungry and a little bit upset after 45 minutes for nothing and we see 2 cookers coming from the kitchen , laughing and making their phone calls .. .."
French,Paul,Lot of History but bad service,-1,20,23-Jan-16,"I was recommended very highly of this place but my experience was very different. They must choose the most unappealing staff and servers. Our server was very rigid with our requests. I mean you are going pay premium prices so you expect the waiters to be a little accommodating. Besides that, there was only 2 servers which made service very slow. The environment of the restarant and set up is very chic and European and the presentation of pastries, macaroons and pies at the counter is mouthwatering but that's where it ends. Food was average at best.It reminded me of a phrase I learnt many years ago. All that glitters is not gold."
French,Paul,Poor Poor service !,-1,10,23-Jan-16,"This so called manager of your paragon outlet has really disappointed us with her level of service . We were seated by your waitering staff at a table and offered a menu. After 10 mins, I waved to this manager for an order , she walked pass and said she will be with us shortly . However , 10 mins passed and she was serving another walkin customer . After which , she went to the kitchen and make her bread?!?. Leaving us stranded for another good 10 mins. Finally decided not to spend my money here and walk off after I gave her a telling off. She seems to realized she forgot abt us!"
French,Paul,"Food is good, service is horrible",-1,30,20-Jan-16,All of our dishes came at different times and one was completely forgotten. Not pleasant to have everyone eat at different times!! Couldnt get anyone's attention for a long time. Definetely not a pleasant experience. Sad because the food was good. Service leaves a lot to be desired.
French,Paul,Do not deliver what it pretends!,-1,10,9-Jan-16,"A real disaster!
They had no wine, the beer was warm and the meat was of poor quality: nerves and grease on the ""tartine""
I don't recommend this restaurant."
French,Paul,Poor food and Shocking Service,-1,10,4-Jan-16,"My wife and I are visiting Singapore to visit family and today chose this outwardly appealing venue for lunch today. It was without doubt the worst mistake we have ever made concerning restaurants in the many years we have been visiting Singapore as the food and service was bad and bordering on Shocking!!Apart from having to wait at least 10 minutes to select a dish, when the meals were served they came up to the table - not together as you would expect but separate with a fair time between each dish being served which made it hard to dine together as we intended.We ordered two seafood salads plus simple dishes of cheese & salad bagette and a meat platter and although the dishes were edible they were far from the standard we were expecting. For example the salds were swimming in viniagette, there was no dressing on the Bagette's salad and the meat platter was smothered in onion (far too much).When it came to personal service..it was literally non-existant even though there seems to be plenty of staff 'running around in circles' achieving very little.The only thing that arrived at the table was the bill and to cap it all they had the audacity to add 10% Service Charge' God know what for.Given our experience today I would advise anyone to steer clear of Pauls in Singapore."
French,Paul,"""Lunch with friends. .",-1,20,23-Dec-15,"Lunch with my girlfriends is always a event lots of fun and exciting moments. .And we diced to get lunch in the one of Paul restaurant. .The food is good no question about it. . The bread is so delicious! ! W hen we there the place was busy, and the service was very poor and the staff lost in place ..so sad !!I'm normally calm and friendly to other people, I have to confess I lost my cool side many times ...Looking forward to another visit and im hoping for a better service. .."
French,Paul,Appalling service for mediocre food,-1,10,16-Dec-15,"Went for lunch with 4 colleagues. We were seated quickly and ordered fast. From there it was all downhill. Our orders arrived about 20 minutes apart with the last dish to arrive a very simple baguette with some lettuce and cold meat on it. Why did it take so long? One colleague gagged on a piece of cling film not properly removed from his chicken roulade. We advised the Chef who simply lifted the piece of plastic off my colleagues unfinished plate with his none to clean fingers without apology, offer of replacement or to strike the cost of the dish off the bill. We then ordered pastries for dessert. Despite the staff only having to lift them from the display counter literally right behind us again they arrived over a period of 20 minutes and again one by one. My cold cappuccino arrived last after everyone had finished. For this dreadful service and average food we paid a hefty 236 dollars. I noticed many other dissatisfied customers but astonishingly there was a queue of people waiting when we left. Never again! Paul management this place is severely damaging your global reputation!"
French,Paul,Poor Service at Westgate branch,-1,10,13-Dec-15,"Yesterday I experienced the same poor service experienced shared by this post in tripadvisor, https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlI wonder if it is the same waitress. Her attitude was the worst. First, no one attended to us when we first entered the restaurant. Then one of the staff indicated a seat. We sat down and this waitress told us the seat had occupants that went to the rest room. We moved to another empty seat and she told us we couldn't seat there because it was a seat for 4. These were obviously two circular tables of 2 placed together to make a 4 seater. The restaurant wasn't even crowded but she insisted for us to move. I left the restaurant and I'm never going back again."
French,Paul,Poor customer service,-1,10,10-Dec-15,"We visited Paul with my family during lunchtime. There was lots of customers. The customer service is very poor, we requested the waiter to check the espresso & the strawberry pastry after the rest of food out. It took 10 minutes with 2 & 3 different waiters to assist this small matter. I suggested that the management should educate the waiter that 1 waiter should finish their task, but not 2 or 3 waiters finish 1 task. Besides this, bill payment also took 10 minutes & let customer to wait & wait. Actually all the pastries are ready-made, they need to take & serve customers directly. The pastries are nice! However, the attitude of the waiters draws the customers away. "
French,Paul,"Poor service, would not return (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",-1,10,8-Dec-15,"I've visited Paul internationally so was excited to find one in Singapore as I usually enjoyed visiting. However after seating down (ourselves as no one was free to greet us at the door), we waited for 15 minutes and literally ignored, even after glances by the staff members in our direction. The restaurant wasn't even busy but others were being served before us. I had enough after waiting for so long that i approached a staff member at the counter and asked why we were being ignored. They made excuses and said we should have put our hand up, but they weren't looking in our direction enough for us to call out for service. I didn't realise I had to keep my hand up for an extended period to get service. All i received was apologies, and the pastry and coffee was sub-par. Would not return as this place has left a sour taste in my mouth. If you want to be treated poorly this is the place to go"
French,Paul,Poor,-1,10,16-Nov-15,"If you like poor coffee, average food, clearing the table yourself, having to go in to order and pay because everyone is too 'busy' then this is the place for you. Otherwise....avoid."
French,Paul,Not Good,-1,10,28-Oct-15,I ordered a simple sandwich and it was served to me looking old. The cheese was hard on the edges as if it had been sitting out for a few hours. I had to ask several times for the drink I ordered only coming after I was done eating. I expect more from. Pauls located in Singapore. 
French,Paul,Comparing to Paul in Paris,-1,30,26-Oct-15,"Been to Paul in Paris and thought just give this one another shot. My second outing to this outlet, first time was when they had the French crew running operations assisting the local guys during their launch and food was replicated superbly well but now I felt it is not as great. Service was struggling to cope but then again it's about the same at some other establishments. Sorry to say this but I'll stick to Paul in Paris. "
French,Paul,Watery Coffee & Average Baked Goods,-1,10,9-Oct-15,"After trying Paul's in Tokyo, which we loved, we were eager to try one of the branches in Singapore. We were at the one in MBFC for coffee and cake. Got a Capuccino, Marochino, croissant, and a fruit tart. Wanted to try some of their other cake but they were out of everything else.The coffee was just rank bad - watery and tasteless. They didn't heat the croissants so they tasted quite faintly of stale butter. The fruit tart was average, nothing to write home about. And, it was quite pricey to boot, which isn't acceptable for this sort of insipid food. Paul's was very disappointing and there was nothing really that could salvage this for us."
French,Paul,Service is just to cry for,-1,10,4-Oct-15,"We did not even get to try the food. Sitting for 25 minutes before a staff member even noticed we were just occupying a table.
We could have sat the whole day there without being noticed. Not sure whether they pay their staff actually."
French,Paul,New Paul at Paragon what a mess,-1,10,28-Sep-15,"Went to try the new outlet on Saturday September 26 we waited 10 mins to get a table and we waited 15 minutes and waved many times to different waitress to get some attentions and the menus and maybe our order, after 4 times of listening coming and spent 20 minutes we went away.No service attention and I guess reading many other comments from other customers quality and taste of food is not where we expect to be for a restaurant bakery like Paul...Need to improve service in each of the Paul in town"
French,Paul,Worst experience in Singapore ,-1,10,24-Sep-15,"My husband and I met up with family here although they'd finished their meal by the time we arrived. We waited in line for a table for a few minutes and nobody acknowledged us just to say ""won't be long"" etc. we were shown to our table and decided what we wanted. I had to ask a member of staff to come and take our order as we'd have been there much longer if I hadn't. My husband ordered a tuna baguette with roasted potatoes and I ordered a pesto and mozzarella flat bread item. After some time my husbands baguette arrived. Ten minutes later the potatoes... I asked a member of staff where mine was and she simply said ""later"" I then asked why we hadn't been given a basket of bread like everyone else around us... She said ""oh you want bread"".... Well yes as everyone else has it! The bread arrived then another ten or so minutes my food arrived. The food was ok but not great. When I asked to pay the bill, the waitress handed it to me then stood over me waiting for me to pay!!! We paid and left then within about 15 minutes we both became unwell with severe stomach upsets! Neither of us had eaten anything else so I can only assume it was down to that meal! Appalling service! Expensive prices! Mediocre food! Never ever again will I return! "
French,Paul,Perpetually crowded,-1,30,24-Sep-15,"Food is alright, but dine in experience wasn't that good. Then again you may be better off just to grab and go. Ultimately its standard bakery stuff, above average quality."
French,Paul,You can do better Paul,-1,30,17-Sep-15,"I have visited a few of these outlets around the world. When it turned up the food was very good. The issue was it kind of came as and when, rather than hot meals for separate guests turning up together. Unfortunate apparent use of microwave added to the disappointment. The confit duck was lovely, the sides though were lacklustre and you do pay a premium in Singapore so I wont let that go. The layered potato bake sauce had separated, it was lukewarm and had been microwaved. The mushrooms on potato rosti that my friend had appeared to be OK, just OK. Then to dessert. The dark chocolate tart was awesome, so nice that it had to have an opposite to go with it. The lemon meringue tart looked like a properly made meringue on the menu, the reality was piped soggy meringue hit with a blow torch for a minute. Then ordering coffee, the coffee was OK, in french style though I requested cream, was told OK and then milk arrived. When questioned, no cream was available, so why say yes twice...Again, just not good enough. So, not rushing back and lots and lots of options in this shopping centre as well."
French,Paul,Newly opened Paul at Paragon,-1,20,7-Sep-15,"We ordered waffle, crepe, hot chocolate and flat white.Waffle: hard and cold, definitely not freshly made, ice cream taste weird;Crepe: hard and cold, not freshly made, lousy;Hot chocolate: not hot, super diluted, tasteless;Flat white: diluted, not enough milk or not fresh milk. Worse than Starbucks.Total cost: $43P.s. We asked for warm water, waitress even came back to confirm again and eventually we got 2 cups of ICE water.We will never come back again. "
French,Paul,This one for me is a no brainer... plain hype and fluff,-1,10,3-Sep-15,"1) Cramped2) Really awful service and incompetent staff3) Not worth paying that much for food; you're paying just for the location(One the other hand, I say the complete opposite of Paul in Dubai JBR location, that one was worth looking forward to a Sunday brunch!)"
French,Paul,Lunch,-1,30,26-Aug-15,"I had a late lunch alone at this resto. Not much people when i came as it was not a normal lunch time.I ordered the following1- lemongrass iced tea- almost flavorless. Lemongrass is smell present though. Not recommended - SgD7.52- chicken roulade- ok. not something that i will make me crave to come back - Sgd23.903. Creme brulee- this is my fav anywhere i go! Here is also average. Sgd-7.9Total paid- 46.26SgdService- average--- i needed to call a staff to order, and even to pay bill.Ambiance- okFor the quality of food served, it's too expensive!"
French,Paul,"Food is less than average, coffee is just milk",-1,10,25-Aug-15,"I came for lunch a few years back when it just opened amd the food and service were really good. So we decided to go again this time, unfortunately it was not the same anymore. We ordered the pie, salad and chicken leg. The pie was cold and dry amd tasteless, unlike any pie i've ever eaten that are warm and runny inside. The so called nicoise salad was very dissapointing, the tuna was so overcooked that it becomes so dry and again tasteless. The chicken leg was not that bad the first few bites, but once you ate the outer skin, the meat on the inside was again, tasteless. I ordered cappucino which only taste like nothing but milk, couldn't even taste a little bit of coffee in there. Did I mention the guy who serve us was either on the verge of dying or he completely hates his life? When we ask for water he sort of sigh and glare then slowly walk away. Too bad, i used to really like this place now its just like a fast food fancy restaurant, the food came out less than 10 mins after we ordered btw."
French,Paul,Paul Offers a Wide Choice of Food in Singapore the Service Disappoints,-1,30,26-Jul-15,"Paul is a well established restaurant. From France to China to Singapore you can find their outlets. The food is generally good and the seating area comfortable. All this is true in Singapore until the pleasure of the visit suffers problems with delivering the service. It is not intentional but it is noticeable. While this may have been a flat patch in their service at Tangling Mall and just been an off day, it did detract from the visit. Would we visit Paul restaurants again, very likely."
French,Paul,Really 2.5 is more accurate.,-1,30,20-Jul-15,"Hmm, the food is good, the atmosphere is nice, even the ""outdoor"" seating, but the service and policies really bring it down, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.This a popular restaurant and the long queue waiting to get seated shows that, it also calls out for a better managed system, maybe a waiting list and SMS when there is an available table, something better. There is also a take away counter, like a traditional bakery with many tasty items calling out to be taken home. This take away counter presents another odd policy/system that should be better thought out. There are items at the take away counter that aren't on the menu, and you can't order them if you are dining in. This is such an odd decision, it is the same restaurant/kitchen the food is already prepared, sell the item for a dollar more and laugh all the way to the bank; yet they would not serve it. Speaking of serving items, our drinks arrived much after our food, and many follow up requests, even a freshly baked waffle came before Ice Lemon Tea. Even the second round of tea took so long to arrive, very disappointing."
French,Paul,Pricey food without quality!,-1,10,17-Jul-15,"Food: They gave me burnt wedges! the salads was normal, the sauce was normal, the food tasted almost like something from Fair Price or may be its from the BBQ section of Cold Storage. I ordered earl grey tea which taste like normal tea which doesn't have even a slight hint of citrus! Totally not worth the price! Service: The waitress doesn't really care to serve you even though there's no crowds."
French,Paul,The quality of food is average only,-1,30,6-Jul-15,"I happened to dine in this restaurant with my mom on Sunday July 5, as all the other restaurants in Takashimaya are fully booked. We had the mushroom soup, which was not too creamy, and not too fattening. However, the bread that came with it was really hard, that my mom nearly cracked her teeth with them. The garlic bread was also no better, as they used the same texture that made the bread. My mom and I shared a club sandwich. Seriously, they are a bit too bland and tasteless, that even the sandwich made by my maid at home is better than theirs. They are obviously short of staff too, as it takes them a while to clear our plates. May not go back again, as maybe their food is not to us the taste of the Asian people."
French,Paul,"Poor service, obviously shorthanded",-1,30,30-Jun-15,"I enjoyed my food at Paul, they are well known for their croissant. The fragrance is irresistible. However, they are very shorthanded. Their water is served after being reminded for 3 times. To take order, I have to ask for service twice as well as getting the bill.Would not go there during peak hour."
French,Paul,Cafe,-1,30,28-Jun-15,"Godo place where to ha e a break and take a cup of coffe. Available also pastries, salad and more. Service very care and very fast."
French,Paul,Lacking,-1,10,7-Jun-15,"Came to the Taka outlet for a Sunday brunch, and as Sunday brunches go, one simply would like a perfect meal on a warm sunny day to prime up for the melancholy Monday soon to come. Sadly, Paul requires more work in this aspect and is nowhere remotely close in offering a palatable experience. My girlfriend and I had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated, which, I must add, is absolutely normal for a fully packed cafe. However it is slightly discerning, and a tad bit infuriating, when one waits for 10 mins when there are empty tables within, as with the case today. But that's not a big deal cause it could have been worse and far longer than 10mins. So we finally gets seated and I ordered a beef tartine to satisfy my morning cannivorous urges while my gf gets her daily dose of good ol anti-oxidants in the form of a crepe champignon. After a decent wait, the waitress came with the crepe and a salmon tartine. With no inkling how beef could have sounded like salmon, I immediately informed her that my order is wrong. Instead of an apology, I got a dirty death stare in return. But she went to change the order nonetheless. So I waited and waited, until my gf is almost done with her food and my beef tartine was still nowhere in sight. I have to qualify that I do see a couple of beef tartines heading out of the kitchen, but were served to other tables whose patrons came after me. Isn't it typical common sense to serve it to the disgruntled customer whom you've gotten his order wrong first? Subsequently, after this arduous 20min wait, I decided to ask the waiter to check on my food. Albeit unlikely, perhaps my English was not clear and he brought the bill instead. Nice. And when I clarifed, he skipped to the kitchen to check and disappeared with no response on the status of my order.To sum up, my food did come after this tormenting wait and to be honest, it wasn't great - definitely not worth the wait nor worth the trouble nor worth having the excitement of a Sunday brunch desecrated. For all the gourmet food that Singapore offers, for better or for worse, Paul simply does not cut it."
French,Paul,Good food albeit slightly pricey,-1,30,24-May-15,"My colleagues and I went to the Paul branch in Takashimaya for a quick dinner. We ordered the tapas plates (beef, shrimp and avocado and chicken) and one pastry (hazelnut croissant if I'm not wrong). I found the shrimp and avocado tapas as well as the hazelnut croissant absolutely delicious! Service was mediocre though. May need to come back to try a heavier meal."
French,Paul,Relaxed,-1,30,17-May-15,I ate breakfast on Saturday. It was quiet and I could be relaxed. The taste is good. It might be difficult to find this shop.
French,Paul,"Good Food, Nasty Staff!",-1,30,25-Apr-15,"I gave it a ""3"" for the food was yummy though pricey. Old lady staff named ""BELLE or BELLA"" was just too nasty that we felt like we begged her to get a table. Good thing I was full of patience that time or else I might have walked away."
French,Paul,Beautiful cafe let down by sloppy service,-1,20,19-Apr-15,"The Paul's restaurant in Ngee Ann City, Orchard Road is set in a beautiful location. Set within Takashimaya department store, the restaurant has views looking onto Orchard Road or within the store itself. The standard Paul's menu has crepes, salads and other delicious meals. We have been here 4 times now for lunch or afternoon tea. While we enjoyed the food, each time we left feeling annoyed and disappointed with the service. Orders were half delivered, items were forgotten, we had to ask for milk for tea several times."
French,Paul,Disappointing,-1,30,4-Apr-15,"yes its a franchise, but goodness me it's dull. The food is not exciting, with no flare or attention paid to it. Paul is a popular chain in the UK and feels much better. This place was average"
French,Paul,"Good dishes, although portions could be bigger for the price we pay",-1,30,24-Mar-15,"We have been to several of their locations in SG and worldwide. In Singapore, their locations are nice, and the dishes quite varied and tasty. The only downside is that you pay the same price, if not more, for typical French items (croque-monsieur or crèpe complète for ex) as you do in a real French restaurant in Singapore. So since this is actually a bistro type of place, their prices should be cheaper."
French,Paul,They can do better,-1,30,21-Mar-15,Business lunch with the Boss. His tuna was overcooked which is a disaster if you a tuna eater. My cod fish was soft and juicy. Breads provided was good. Drinks ordered without ice came but it came with ice. Service was pleasant on this occasion. Overall was a good experience but the overcooked tuna does not help customers coming back. 
French,Paul,Paul first timer,-1,30,8-Mar-15,"I came to this lovely pastries shop last November. This place is really happening back in my hometown Jakarta, so as a pastry lover i should give it a try. I tried peach danish, chocolate mousse, lemon meringue tart and mango tart. So sorry but for me, tiong bahru bakery's pastries are better than paul's but maybe it's just me and my common palate :)"
French,Paul,Bad service,-1,10,28-Feb-15,Very bad service. Staff was rude and were inflexible in accommodating requests. Went at 2115. Half the tables inside was empty. But staff was unwilling to let us sit inside. It was a good hour before last orders. Very bad experience.
French,Paul,Letting the name of paul down with terrible service,-1,10,14-Feb-15,The kitchen just do not seem to understand that two people eating want to eat at the same time. Went here 6 weeks ago and my wife was served her food after I had finished mine. We tried again today and to make it simple we ordered the same simple meal. Hers arrived and I was assured mine was on the way. 15 mins later my wife had finished and mine still not arrived. I eventually got up and told the waitress to forget it as I was going to eat somewhere else. When she came with the bill it still had both meals on it. Will never eat here again and I think paul head office needs to sent someone quickly to sort this place out.
French,Paul,Expensive lunch,-1,30,28-Dec-14,Great looking place with a big queue. The whole concept seems based on keeping you waiting to maintain the queue. After fifteen minutes waiting we eventually got a table. The waited ten minutes to get served. The menu was good with a wide array of breads etc. the omelette I had was good and the salad excellent. They had ran out of small macaroons and the desert seemed to be missing components. Unless you like queuing to be with the incrowd best avoid! 
French,Paul,"Nice location, good food, slow service.",-1,30,2-Dec-14,"We enjoyed a nice lunch once it finally arrived. Paul's is nicely located for shoppers. Our experience was not stellar. We are ok with waiting for a table, but once seated, I really don't enjoy people having their order taken who arrived and sat down at least two groups behind us. The food was good, and their baguettes are excellent. I would try it again, but why when there are so many other great restaurants in Singapore."
French,Paul,Place with a view,-1,30,30-Nov-14,"When you need a coffee break during your shopping at Takashimaya you will find the coffee and cakes cheap because you just spent so much at this paradise of luxury. It's actullat not and the quality is average but the location runs the show. sit next to a window and watch the world go by and dont be angry about the steep prices, you are in a choice location where the rent is probably as high as in NY or London. "
French,Paul,Business Lunch,-1,30,20-Oct-14,Quite cramped although decor looks chic and the place is clean and new. The beef tartine served on bread was weak although the salmon baked in puff pastry was enjoyable. Nothing particularly outstanding though and pricey considering that.
French,Paul,Not even close to any Paul in France,-1,20,8-Sep-14,"Forget the real Paul in France. Since here you'll find only the same name on the door, nothing else.Pricey place inside the famous Takashimaya shopping mall. Service quite rude, no smiles at all and food not well presented, especially when you pay 9 SGD for a slice of cake you don't expect a broken piece thrown on a plate. When you pay 17 SGD for ONE coffee and ONE slice of cake you'd like something more.Wasted money."
French,Paul,Not to recommend,-1,10,20-Jun-14,I was extremely disappointed that the food menu distributed on Every table as a set was only available as of a certain hour and I was told that I have to wait 20min until I could order it. Very strict timing; not really French.
French,Paul,Staff more concern with her personal agenda,-1,20,20-Jun-14,"Visited the outlet at Takashimaya on the 18th June 2014 together with my wife and I, we were attended to a somewhat distracted hostess, no smile, not a care in the world. I politely told her that we would prefer to sit outside as I felt we were slightly under-dressed for the inside of the restaurant.The hostess, with funky hair highlights of her fringe walked to the end of the restaurant, placed the menu on the table and just left. Ok, maybe because we look like a couple of 'can't afford kinda people'. Realistically, I don't care about that. What really irks me was the fact that that hostess was moaning to I guess would be her supervisor about how she was not granted her leave of absence to go for her holiday.All my wife and I wanted was a peaceful meal and we can't help but to merely eat and 'watch' our comic relief. My advise to the supervisor and the moaning hostess, please take your personal issues away from your PAYING customers, you are an international restaurant, not a void deck coffeeshop. On a side note, the tomato soup was good. We basically ate our dinner, paid and got out of there. This was my very first time to Paul @ Taka, probably also my last."
French,Paul,Pauls (Tanglin Mall),-1,10,19-Jun-14,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. We had lunch and it was over-priced, the food was very so so, and a the waiter was so rude (from start to finish). They had a basket of bread on the table and we ate a few pieces. I ask for a bag to take the leftover bread home. The waiter rudely told me no this is not possible as it is free while you are in the restaurant only. So we ask - so you reuse this bread and he replied no we throw it away. I don't believe a restaurant would be so wasteful. I think they reuse the bread in the basket which is absolutely disgusting. I will not eat there again and do not recommend it."
French,Paul,Bad service! Paul @Takashimaya,-1,10,5-Jun-14,"my friend and I went to this place mainly to find a place to feed our babies. One of the lady staff prepared a sitting place for us to include 2 prams which was much appreciated. But another guy staff asked me to ONLY take 1 pram and leave one outside.Obviously, we're not happy because our babies need to sleep inside the pram after feeding.my friend and I insisted that we really need the two prams to be in.Well, If it's too limited space to bring in the pram, he can actually ask us to wait for another sitting area instead of give that bad suggestions. *which I can see there's other tables already cleared.We almost want to leave but then we choose to stay because the lady helps me push the other pram in while my friend can start to feed her baby first. Good service from the lady staff.We ordered ice latte and the taste just average and the chocolate cake taste alright but not delicious. Given a choice, we wouldn't want to choose this restaurant anymore."
French,Paul,could be so good but staff are poor,-1,20,24-May-14,"Having been to Paul in the UK and France i was expecting more from the Paul in Singapore. The food is as you would expect, French and expensive but more boring than in Europe. The selections are often lacking in imagination but the contents are mostly delicious especially the desserts.The refusal to service the full menu before 11.30 is just annoying and the staff are not at all accommodating or service orientated. The breakfast menu is sparse and they refused to serve separate bread to my partner even though being vegetarian she had limited options and despite their being bread served with other non-vegetarian foods.Not impressed."
French,Paul,pretty packed!,-1,30,28-Apr-14,"Paul is huge in Western Europe as far as I reckon. When I knew they open several chains in Asia, I was a bit skeptical. But hey I got it wrong. This Paul store in Singapore is the next big thing. So packed during brunch-dinner. Loving their Caesar salad and their bread of course. Bravo, Paul! :D"
French,Paul,Breakfast ,-1,20,26-Apr-14,"came for a quiet Saturday breakfast. Place is okay. Not wonderful experience. First the waiter said that we could only Sit in passage because the management is saving electricity by not running the AC. when we asked door a plug point, we were told that they have no plug points. When asked if there was internet, there is none. It just felt like a breakfast full of excuses. The only good thing from this place is the view."
French,Paul,Cold coffee and weak tea,-1,10,1-Apr-14,Lousy weak tea from a tea bag and cappuccino was cold. Tat and pastry was good though. Request to change the tea was denied. I felt this was denied
French,Paul,"Good food, lousy service",-1,30,21-Mar-14,The food at the cafe is good. The bakery is outstanding. The coffee is not good. The service is not good.
French,Paul,Pastry dessert not as tasty but Steak was good,-1,30,19-Mar-14,"Went with colleagues last evening for dinner at Paul's Takashimaya (Halal restaurant, went with muslim colleagues). Service staff seemed untrained and didn't have the proper knowledge to make recommendations. Drinks was pricey at $7.50 for Lemon iced tea (just a slice of lemon and has a bitter taste). Desserts we had was a strawberry tart (not as good as we thought) and chocolate part (texture was very dry)We ordered a main course Steak medium well for me that was the only saving grace for this restaurant, pretty good tender steak that I would recommend. For the price we paid, I think we were only paying for the parisian decor."
French,Paul,"so so food, poor service",-1,20,12-Mar-14,"Went to Paul at Trader’s twice lately because one of my son was not with us in the 1st visit and wanted to try. Both times the bread was way too hard. Another thing that disappointed me was the restaurant’s apparent habit of dumping a basket of bread without offering plates or butter. It happened in my 1st visit and in my 2nd visit, I had to ask the Chinese waiter twice after waiting 10 minutes before he nonchalantly gave us plates to eat our bread; that was before our main course. I don’t know if its customary in French restaurants of this range, but it would take very little effort for the staff to ask guests if they wanted butter or plates (if one has to ask for plates in the first place) rather than dump the bread and disappear. Such dampener at the beginning spoil the mood for the whole meal and I wonder how the restaruant earnerd some of those praises"
French,Paul,Mediocre pastry and service,-1,30,9-Mar-14,"Having heard raves and good reviews about Paul's Bakery and always seeing the long queues, we were eager to try it, thinking that it must have been very impressive. However, our first experience left us with much to be desired.After a tough mental battle between Hot Chocolate and Tea Gourmand, I decided on the latter, which came with three pieces of Macorons as well. While I sipped my hot tea, I nibbled on the a-tad-too-sweet macarons, glad to be able to swallow the saccharine tiny cookie-like pastries easier.No worries there, the tea and macarons were not the highlight anyway. We patiently awaited our tarts to be served.I had the Chocolate Tartlette- a small name for a rather good-sized pastry. The crust was solid and not crumbly like how some tarts fall apart the moment it is put to the fork's test. The chocolate was .... nondescript? There was no rich strong aroma of good chocolate or the bittersweet-ness of my favorite dark chocolate; the taste was pleasant, but nothing that blew me away. It was a rather normal chocolate tart, in my humble opinion.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/tea-at-pauls-bakery.html"
French,Paul,People Queue for This?!,-1,30,4-Mar-14,"Very expensive food that makes you feel that you're paying in Euro. Elbow to elbow seating, ala Parisian cafes. People Queue for This?! Maybe the fengshui of this place is really good."
French,Paul,"Really Bad Service (Paul Bakery, Westgate Mall branch)",-1,10,3-Feb-14,"Couldn't find where to write specifically for the Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall. For those who do not know, Paul Bakery at Westgate Mall is the latest branch. The Paul Bakery at Westgate mall is yet another cafe who has such bad service until I simply cannot tolerate. As someone who has written and edited many customer service guidebooks as well as an easy-going person in general, never in my life did I expect to be CHASED out of a cafe/restaurant as soon as I tried to sit down. Let me explain what happened. My friend and I decided to have our lunch at this Paul Bakery today. We saw the queue sign outside the high class bakery and we were wondering if we should even queue since there isn't ANYONE queuing. We waited for a while before deciding to just walk in since no one came to attend to us and also because we saw quite a good number of empty seats. So we very happily walk in thinking what a nice place it is, with all the beautiful French decor. Note that no one even bothered attending to us. So we thought it's pretty straightforward that we can just choose our seats FREELY (which person wouldn't do that you tell me? It doesn't matter that no one bothered to attend to us since they probably are busy. Although i don't see how busy the staff were) . So we chose an empty table for 4 and I sat down. Then this waitress came up to us and said loudly, ""miss, that table is for four persons, you cannot sit there. You must sit at the 2 person table."" I immediately thought to myself, ""You never even attend to me and ask me how many pax do we actually have and you tell me I cannot sit so loudly. The 4 pax table is made up of 2 small tables and can definitely be SEPARATED if NEEDED."" So I said, the extra table can be separated if needed. Now, there were only 2 other 2-pax tables in the whole cafe. One at the entrance but the table was damn small (okay, we wanted to order more food. So they expect us to sit at a freaking small table just because there were only 2 of us? Honestly, if we are going to order a lot of food, we should just choose a bigger table which can contain all our food items isn't it? This is really common sense. If I am just ordering a COFFEE, fine, I squeeze. I think I AM FAIR in this aspect). And so, I spotted a nice looking spot which has a better table at one of the corners and requested for it but the table was not cleaned yet as the previous patrons just left. Guess what, the honorable waitress actually told me ""that table cannot sit because we need to clear the table first. You have to GO OUTSIDE and QUEUE."" I asked my friend if I heard wrongly or did that waitress really ask me to get up from my seat and go out of the door and queue? Yes, I have to open the freaking big door and go stand outside. Everyone in the cafe suddenly just turned and looked at us. Please note that we still did not make any unreasonable request or became unreasonable. The only thought was unbelief with the sucky attitude. They could have first come up to us and ask us how many pax do we have, is it only 2 persons, if so, is it possible that we choose a 2 pax table instead so they could offer the table to customers who are in 4s if they happen to come in. As a high class cafe, they should expect that patrons may walk in anytime to reserve a table while waiting for other friends. You cannot deny this is a common culture in Singapore and probably anywhere else in the world. They could have ask us to take a seat first while they clear the table since there really isn't a queue. We have already obliged by relocating to a 2 pax table. So we were asked to GO OUTSIDE and stand. Not wanting to make a fuss, we simply went out to stand under the scrutiny of the whole cafe. I must say that was a ""very nice"" send-off by so many people. Meanwhile, there was a Caucasian lady who stepped into the restaurant at the same time. She was also not allowed to sit. I don't know what was the reason but she was obviously astonished with the attitude as she walked out and the three of us actually look at the cafe with a ""what is wrong"" glance and we decided to walk away at the same time. We actually met the same Caucasian lady at the next cafe. My point is, I am pissed not because I can't have lunch there. I am just damn pissed that I am getting such a bad attitude and service when I actually obliged. I don't mind obliging to your request to queue OUTSIDE if you have told me politely that you would like us to queue outside while you get the table ready and that you will come get me once the table is ready. At least, you can definitely just allow me to SIT at the empty tables or hand me the menus first. But I mind it freaking A LOT when you tell me to go outside and stand and that I can't sit at any empty table. You are a high class French cafe with very good branding. But you have very bad (probably non exist) f & b service management. Instead of keeping your customers and making them feel welcomed, you actually turn away not one but 3 customers who are willing to eat at your cafe!"
French,Paul,Not French Cuisine,-1,20,22-Jan-14,"We visited the restaurant in Ngee Ann City in Singapore last night. All we wanted was a quick dinner so we thought we would give the outlet a try. We were here 2/3 years ago when it opened and walked out due to the total lack of service. Tonight the greeting was quicker and more professional. I ordered the beef steak. It had almost no flavour and very little to commend it all. The gravy tasted as if it was an instant gravy mix and had just been mixed with water and poured over. The saute potatoes were soft and soggy. The speed with which the meal arrived should have set some warning bells ringing. I sense the possible use of a microwave.My partner went for seafood meal which consisted of 2 mussels and 2 prawns in a bechamel sauce. He tells me it tasted of wallpaper paste, but I am not sure how he knows this.To drink we had Orangina which I imagine it would be difficult to mess up. The total bill was SGD77 which was very much overpriced for the food we received.I noticed at a nearby table that the main course of the diners meal arrived before they had finished their starter. The restaurant needs to do something about timing. Most of the staff looked totally bored and they didn't seem as though they wanted to be there. I know how they feel!!!If you find yourself in Singapore this is one eatery to give a miss. However, to establish some balance I have to tell you that the breads and pastries in the takeaway shop looked excellent. It may be case of a touch of diversity in the products on offer going a step too far."
French,Paul,Not that different,-1,30,19-Jan-14,"I went there for a brunch. The service was nice but everything was cold. I asked the waiter if there products is Halal and he said everything is Halal but after that there is people say it is not, I hope they do not lie about these things."
French,Paul,"Paul, at the moment, is NOT HALAL",-1,30,3-Jan-14,"In ""reply"" to Anneayesha's review, at the moment, 3rd January 2014, Paul is NON-HALAL French bakery. If you need further clarification, please check the MUIS website or their twitter account: @halalSG. Thank you."
French,Paul,Halal French Restaurant: Just Average,-1,30,27-Nov-13,"Nice decor however not as competent as other french restaurants i have been to. Service was pretty bad as waitress was not very polite in getting orders as well as not prompt in service. The food was nothing extraordinary. We had beef steak ($28.90) and seafood gratin( $24.90) and salmon croissant ($17.90). The seafood gratin is too cheesy. The bitter-ness from the emmanuel cheese does not help in making it taste better at all. The salad which comes with it taste so much better. However, the beef steak (can't rmmbr the actual name) was good. Sauce and dressing complements the meat well. The deserts were good (ordered the crepe -$7.90, the strawberry tart - $6.90, and the chocolate eclair - $6), the french baguette was tasty, soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Bill totalled to about $130 inclusive of GST."
French,Paul,French illusions,-1,20,21-Oct-13,"To be fair the pastries to go are good. However the restaurant food is poor and the price expensive. As others have said it is just not French food. We had the steak. It was the antithesis of a French steak. It was tough, skinny and stuck in the mouth. The accompanying potato was over cooked and did not seem freshly made. The deserts were varied. The creme brûlée was ok but burnt on top. The crepe with sugar was terrible. It was cold and pasted to the plate. i could not scrape most of it off. The chocolate waffle was the winner for the day no complaints there.The service was fair. The staff were pleasant and helpful once you got their attention. Little things such as refilling water could have been better but I have had much worse. The decor and setting is good and it is a shame that the standard of food does not match the ambience and price. Stick to the takeaway pastries."
French,Paul,Bad French Atmosphere,-1,10,4-Oct-13,"I visited Paul@Ngee Ann City on two occasions, the last visit was a few months ago.This outlet has NO ATMOSPHERE on both occasions that I visited. The staff are mostly local Malays and Chinese. There is a complete absence of any French atmosphere. Cooking is uninspiring.Serving is haphazard.Service is poor.With the small portions, it makes for extremely poor value overall."
French,Paul,Very average.....,-1,20,18-Sep-13,And the price is high.....not French food by any standard .....we went for lunch and and we're very disappointed .....my husband ordered cod fish which came with a little salad without ant dressing and steep at S$ 27......I had a Provençal tartain ....which was served on soggy bread....not a what i expected........very little cheese ....shavings of outer peels of vegetables ....very average.....
French,Paul,Late Tea at Paul,-1,30,10-Sep-13,"It was like 5pm+ and we passed by here. I was attracted by Paul's beautiful cakes and pastries. We decided to have a cup of tea and few pieces of cakes here! The environment was great, very comfy and relaxing. I liked the raspberries tart we ordered. Freshly touch but not too sweet. C'est bon! Paul is def. one of the good places for afternoon tea and cake in Orchard areaCheersD"
French,Paul,Opens for breakfast yet no typical breakfast items available!,-1,30,17-Aug-13,"Paul a French patisserie opens for breakfast at 9am (different to whats advertised) and has an extensive section in their menu of different drinks with a breakfast item. This item includes a croissant or a pain de chocolate, typical for a French breakfast and what's on offer at Paul's. Yet it's not ready and this isn't the first time it - happens consistently that these items as stated on their menu are not ready. The staff then offer you to go to the counter to choose something else all more of the cake variety, morning or afternoon tea or sandwiches. For a European like myself I come here to have a European breakfast after all that's what they are selling, so don't bother - go somewhere else, as it wasn't just me complaining the table next to me too (a French native) as well, therefore this must be consistent service down falls. The staff just look and apologise not sure what they are trying to achieve with this! At 930 I asked again if they are ready, was told another 15 minutes! So apart from breakfast, their breads and pastries are nice, fresh and in season. "
French,Paul,Mediocre food and service,-1,20,2-Aug-13,"The cafe au liat has no coffee taste - i compare it to the 2 other cafes in the same building - this is of poor quality. The blueberry tart was ok - nothing fantastic. While i was there some other customer, who were there before me, got irritated at not receiving one order of food, which seemed to be just an order of toast. My order was served earlier than theirs. Since there are 2 other cafes there, i would not step into this one again"
French,Paul,huge disappointment,-1,10,29-Jul-13,"Over the past years we ate breakfast at Paul Dubai regularly. Furthermore, we had good experience at Paul outlets in France.We must agree with most of the points raised from those who reviewed Paul. Customers who have patronised Paul certainly know what to expect. The cafe decor and sitting are impressive. However, the food and service need serious improvement.Coffee was normal but came only half cup full. Most of the menu dishes are served with toast bread rather than something ""french"". Omelette, mushroom came cold and looked pathetically cheap. Most of all, you had to ask for butter and jam! And they ran out of strawberry jam, which is the hallmark of Paul.If they want customer to return, they have to put their act together and bring back the real Paul's quality and image."
French,Paul,"Take away, don't waste money dining in",-1,30,20-Jul-13,"We have heard from friends and colleagues how great Paul is...the real french bakery in SIngapore, a must visit!First experience was with takeaway - perfect. Real good bread, amazing pastries, nothing to complain about, just great and we will be back again and again.Today we decided to go there for breakfast. Please, if you think about doing the same, don't bother. It really is not worth the trouble and the money you leave there.The line outside was not too bad, we only waited about 10 min. Service was fine, neither good, nor bad, quick and to the point.The worst thing is the actual food. Not what you expect from a French bakery with their prices. They make great breads and pastries, so I just cannot understand why they must serve such mediocre food. Croque monsieur for $17 with cheap turkey ham and tasteless cheese and few sad salad leaves? Salad was actually the best thing on the plate. A very big disappointment. Coffee was another disappointment. Honestly, you will have a much better breakfast at Toast Box with great coffee for a good price.We are sticking to takeaway at Paul, pastries are the best we have found in Singapore so far."
French,Paul,Atrocious service...,-1,10,16-Jul-13,Been here several time.. Always have a problem with service but never as bad as today when I have to walk off. I don't know whether if it's because I have 2 kids in tow that they don't take me seriously or I am not dressed to the nines like the other customers. Sat there like an idiot waiting for a staff to take my orders but they seem to conveniently ignored me and took everyone's order who came after me. Decided to leave because no matter how much waving got me no attention... 
French,Paul,Not Impressive,-1,20,20-May-13,"Price paid not worth for the service & food rendered. Servers not attentive, food took way too long to arrive even when the restaurant is not packed. $8 for a small cup of orange juice? But we all agreed that the best dish had to be the beef tartine :) "
French,Paul,Go for take-away,-1,20,7-Apr-13,"""Fresh"" orange juice diluted with water, a tiny tiny jam pot when you take a basket of bread to share, scruffy waiters that do not pay attention to you and 1:40 min to get served. Where are your French standards Paul?! This is the typical example of a low-cost, low-class excellent value-for-money shop that tries to export a luxury ""look"" just because they are French. You clearly failed! You are better off sticking to what you do best, Paul: nice, tasty boulangerie. Quit trying to copy your brother LaDuree, you have not gotten the same name and experience!Positives: Cooked-from-frozen croissants don't taste that bad..."
French,Paul,Poor service and attitude,-1,10,2-Apr-13,"Had afternoon tea on a Saturday afternoon... long wait for a table.Ordered tea... Tea came in a teapot which had too much water for 1 teabag. Found that out when I poured my tea, it was like dishwater .And water was not hot enough. When asked for a another teabag was told had to pay for it. I pointed out that they had put too much water in the pot for one bag and that is why I wanted another bag, we asked to speak to the manager, waiter walked away, eventually we flagged down the waiter that took our order and spoke to him about the problem with the tea, I asked for a replacement pot with a lot less water, which he obliged he then proceeded to tell me not to put so much milk in my tea!!! I usually visit Paul when in Singapore, on my previous visits the service has been good but this time will be the last time. But does it matter to them...I doubt it.. judging by the line waiting to go in and the attitude of the staff."
French,Paul,Paul's @ Nee Ann City,-1,30,1-Apr-13,French Patisserie with lousy coffee - again - my beef with restaurants using UHT milk - what's up with that? Puhlease...I know in France I would get proper quality milk with my Café Au Lait...and why not with quality French pastries and brunch? I'm not going back until they do something about the coffee - oh - and the service.
French,Paul,Ticked off the 'to do list',-1,30,18-Mar-13,"My husband and I went to Paul for a Saturday breakfast. I had been planning on going for months after salivating at the wonderful array of pattisseries in the take away section. We had an egg, turkey ham, tomato and 'soft' bread plate. The food tasted fine, but it was nothing special. Price was OK at just under $10 for the meal. I had a cappucino which was very good. The carrot and ginger juice ( a bit pricey at $8) was nice. The service was fine - prompt and obliged us moving tables - but this was before the obligatory queues mid morning. The front area is very a bit cramped - not sure what you have to do to get an inside table. The pastries looked wonderful and I wish I had chosen the croissant and coffee."
French,Paul,Worst meal I have had in Singapore,-1,10,15-Mar-13,"Our experience was so poor, I am not sure where to start. Surly, disorganized staff - dirty cutlery - ridiculous wait for a server to bring menus and to place an order. As if that was not bad enough, the overflowing garbage can was too much until one of the staff sorting clean cutlery stopped what he was doing and proceeded to pick up garbage from the overflowing can and push it down before returning to sort more 'clean' cutlery. Needless to say, we had seen enough, got our check and left....never to return. The positive thing about Paul I can think of is its location on Orchard Road."
French,Paul,"Nice food, poor service",-1,20,3-Mar-13,"We went to Paul to have a quick dinner recently. The food was good and it was served quickly although the selection wasn't quite as large as in Paris for example.However, the whole experience was let down by the poor service that we received. We arrived there close to 9 PM and the restaurant wasn't busy. We stood in front of the restaurant and waited for a wait staff to find us a table. There was a group of staff that was just standing around and gossiping and one of them (a short, Chinese auntie-looking staff) saw us but just ignored us and continued to gossip with her colleagues. Another wait staff (a Chinese guy) also saw us but also ignored us and continued to sashay past us. We must have waited for close to 5 mins before a Malay waitress greeted us and showed us to a table. We were also ignored again during the short time we were in the restaurant.I understand that this is Singapore, where service is horrible and basically non-existent. But somehow I thought it would be different given the type of establishment this is. Clearly I was wrong. We won't be back, I don't think the food is phenomenal enough to make up for the poor service that we received."
French,Paul,Absolutely terrible and not worth it,-1,10,18-Feb-13,"I visited Paul on a Sunday close to lunch time. There wasn't a line when we got there but it was relatively crowded. We got a table immediately. Then it all went downhill. We ordered water, and my glass had a smell. I asked to change it and the waitress brought another glass back and put it on one corner of the table, further away from me, when she knew it was my glass that had the smell. We ordered one Boeuf Tartine and one Crepe Complet. We had to wait for a while for the food. But when it did come, it was not hot, not even warm. It also didn't taste good. Dessert was waffle, which we shared. Again, it took a while to arrive and we had to chase for it. When it did come, it wasn't hot as well! if it took a while to come surely it must mean that it was just cooked and should be hot? It also tasted rather stale. Service staff, while not rude, hardly said anything, and merely gestured. They were however surprisingly friendly and chatty to one table away from us, probably a regular customer. All in, a really disappointing experience and I would not go back again. Neither would I recommend anyone to go there to eat. I've tried their cakes and pastries before, and they are decent. Perhaps visit if you only want cakes, but not for a meal."
French,Paul,Overhyped,-1,30,31-Dec-12,"We were in Takashimaya and we decided to try Paul. First, the queue to get a seat was long. A combination of reasons we guessed - lots of first timer diners trying out, diners were taking a long time to decide and service was slow. Yes, service was a let down. That was a combination of factors too - possible new waiters/waitresses, cramp seating space and the kitchen can't get the orders out at the same time.The food was nothing to shout about. I believe there are other pastry eateries/bakeries with equal or better baquettes, macaroons, lemon tarts and crepes and without a famous name and/of a popular location like Paul.If you have lots of time (as mentioned the queue is long), a couple (if your group is more than a couple, your wait will be longer) and no place to go in Takashimaya, then Paul could be your place. The service may continue to be poor. After all, as long as the queue is long getting in, Paul is still happy."
French,Paul,Bad and unfriendly service,-1,20,3-Sep-12,"My family and have been to Paul twice now, and twice it has been disappointing for exactly the same reason: Paul seems unable to make sure that everyone around the table gets their food at approximately the same time. The first time we had our three kids having to wait half an hour while my wife and I got our meals after maybe 10 minutes. And last time it was my wife who's breakfast hadnt even arrived when my kids and I were already long finished. Its not such a large restaurant, nor are the dishes very complicated, so it shouldnt be so difficult for Paul to serve everyone relatively quickly and at the same time.A friendly apology in such a case would go a long way, but the staff is very disinterested. They couldnt care less it seems. We had to cancel my wife's meal.It's a shame, if Paul could train their staff better, it would be a great (though still very pricy for such simple dishes) place for breakfast and lunch."
French,Paul,Nice environment,-1,30,11-Jul-12,"Went there for breakfast as the breads, pastries and tarts look tasty. The place was very nice though but the breads are some how a little disappointed. The baguette was a little under proof as the result for after baking, the bread was soggy on the inside, very chewy. The other food wise was so so. Service wise was excellent. Good service and courtesy."
French,Paul,Middle of the (Orchard) Road...,-1,30,23-Jun-12,"I spend some time with friends sampling food at Paul's...it's located, conveniently, right in the middle of Orchard Road at Ngee Ann City, better known as Taka!In short, it's a salad place, the service a little of an afterthought and the name more of a hype. The queue is long and the food is just not great. The tables are placed close together and an overall sense of claustrophobia is prevalent. However, try the salads, they are fresh and creatively mixed with prawn or chicken and make for a good healthy stop-over break from luxury shopping."
French,Paul,Good food; service can be improved :-),-1,30,28-May-12,"The last time I headed down to Ngee Ann, I noticed that there was a new restau. I was quickly intrigued by the new place upon seeing from afar that 1.) the interiors looked very nice, 2.) the place was packed (a good indicator that it's a must-try), and 3.) there was a queue just outside the dining place. Some friends and I recently tried Paul for a Sunday brunch. Because we arrived at the place around 1130, we didn't have to queue for long to get a table. Our table was very near the bakery of the cafe, which gave us a good view of all the baked goodies. I was more excited about the breads rather than the brunch menu. Hehe!I ordered the Crepe Complete - turkey and cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. It also came with a small portion of greens. For dessert, we got a fruit tart, a lemon tart, Napoleon, and macarons. I must say that I enjoyed dessert more. While the crepe tasted nice, I would have added a few more dollars to what I paid and I could have had a bigger brunch plate at one of the other brunch places around the island. The desserts (and most probably the breads) would be the main reason to head to Paul. Just beside the restau, the bakery would be found. The few hours we sat there, there wasn't a moment where there was no customer buying baked goodies. Really nice. What Paul can improve on is the service. It's kind of challenging to get the attention of the wait staff. Sure, the place was packed but that has never been an acceptable excuse for me. Nevertheless, I think I will go back to Paul to try the mains or if I happen to be in the area, and I'm craving for some nice pastries or freshly baked bread."
French,Paul,"Tourist don't go, Singaporean don't bother, Ngee Ann basement offer better food",-1,10,6-May-12,"I heard of this restaurant from my friends 8 months back. Decided to try it.Initially I thought that the restaurant was very nice with the queue. Only to realised that they actually kept the tables empty to create the queue.Google ""Paul Bakery Hungrygowhere"" you'll probably find more negative comments on the Paul Bakery.Things that went really wrong:- coffee was way too acidic- chocolate cake was worse than me making a brownie instant mix. I'm not kidding- creme brulee taste worse than instant mix as well- crepes was average- service is really badSummary it's a place that looked European but serve really lousy desserts. Menu looks nice but it don't taste nice at all. Totally disappointment, spend SGD 42. I'll probably feel happier spend that amount in Ngee Ann City Basement.I'm writing this review because it's definitely NOT worth the visit and the high review on Trip Advisor is totally misleading. If I'm the tourist, I'll be totally pissed off if I tried this place. Singaporean, please just go to basement, the food there MUCH better than this place."
French,Poulet,Decent food however not worth the price.,-1,30,21-Sep-18,"Visited this place with my gf for dinner. The service was good however the portion sizes werent exactly large. Even though the food tasted pretty good, I wouldn't return because of the price. I feel the price they charge isnt realistic for what you get, there are far better options out there for that."
French,Poulet,Affordable Lunch,-1,30,2-Dec-16,"Been years since we last visited. We ordered their set combo for 2 pax. Very satisfying and filling combo set which includes 2 choice of drinks, 2 x mushroom soup, 2 side dishes, Salad de Paris and Poulet Roti.The chicken was deeply flavoured with a tint of citrus taste in the meat. We felt the mushroom chardonnay sauce was unnecessary because that would actually cover up the aroma from the meat and made the chicken skin less appetising. Overall experience "
French,Poulet,Could have been better,-1,30,14-Jul-15,"Poulet occupies a choice location on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Point. It's normally packed at lunch time and on weekends but it was relatively quiet on a Monday night. I decided to order their signature dish, the poulet roti (rotisserie chicken) which came in a shallow dish of mushroom cream sauce with some spinach leaves sprinkled around ($15.90 for half a chicken). My dish arrived incredibly quickly, possibly within a minute. The cream sauce was quite nice and the half portion of chicken was more than enough for one person. However, it was clear that my chicken had been left for too long on the rotisserie as the breast meat was a bit dry and the thigh meat was alright but not juicy the way freshly roasted chicken should have been. The thigh meat had also darkened in colour, indicating that it had been heated for a while. I also found the dish a bit salty. The marinade had penetrated the thigh meat, but that meant it was also on the salty side. Perhaps if it had been a busier day, the turnover of dishes would have been faster and I would have received a more tender and juicy chicken. My glass of water was, as other reviewers mentioned, 50 cents, although to be fair, the waitress did highlight this to me beforehand. However, it was a nice, quiet venue to catch a quick dinner and the staff were quite friendly and attentive."
French,Poulet,Thirsty? We don't care.,-1,20,8-Jul-15,"This one gets a 2 because the food was good. We asked for 4 different dishes and all were well made, better than expected for such a restaurant. But a restaurant is not only about the food. There is more pleasure in eating good food when the service makes you feel welcome, and Poulet did not make us feel welcome. What irritated me is that we had arrived feeling very thirsty and we were not offered a glass of water. I could see a jar of water by the cashier and waited many minutes to see a waiter on site. When I finally got a waiter, I asked him for cold water to which he replied that they had no cold water but only hot water and that the glass would cost us 50 cents a piece! This is something I've never heard of: restaurants charging for tap water. Water is a basic need, especially in hot places like Singapore, and it should be common courtesy in a restaurant to serve it liberally. I only did not get up to leave because we had 2 hungry kids with us. We ended up asking for mineral water because we'd not pay for tap water, much less hot tap water (Yes, I know this is exactly what they wanted us to do). Poulet really lost me there. I'll never return because I see this as pure stinginess. Considering their high prices (you've got to ask for a few side dishes in order to get a complete, balanced meal with your expensive half chicken) and the fact that customers do pay for service charges, it's really bad and absolutely unreasonable that they would not serve cold water; therefore, I'd rate it a no-no for customer service friendliness, which -- let's be frank -- is all what a restaurant is about apart the food itself."
French,Poulet,Quick lunch in Bedock Mall,-1,30,3-Jul-15,"French style chicken place, very resonably priced lunch in a Mall.Simple fast and good tasting food, service was Ok i had the Belly pork, a little on the small side as portions go, especially as they are serving half a chicken for teh same price, one of our group had an open sandwich which more resembled a Pizza nice all the same."
French,Poulet,Uncomplicated French lunch,-1,30,24-Jun-15,"The three things ambience, food and the services make together a great dining experience - of which service is made finitely a strong point at least for this outlet. I had poulet roti half for the lunch at sgd 15.9 and topped it up by soup and ice lemon tea for another sgd 5. The mushroom soup was good - liked the bread crumbs. The chicken came in a pool of mushroom cream sauce - slightly salty but ok to my taste bud. The half roast quantity was generous - can easily be shared. The ambience was interesting with the open kitchen - overall overpriced for local standard but underpriced from French dining perspective - overall average and uncomplicated. "
French,Poulet,A cuisine is not just assemble ingredients in a plate,-1,10,21-Jun-15,"Went to the Chinatown Point branch.First time I tried a ""French"" cuisine, and it is disappointing. We order half a roasted chicken that they are famed for. The chicken tasted bland, and at most, it is only warm, not hot. I suspected it was micro wave before serving, (the chicken skin is soggy as well). It was served on a big plate of mushroom cream sauce, but, when dipped with chicken, the cream overpower the chicken taste. you are effectively eating cream.Second dish is Duck with red wine. There is no taste of red wine in it. Again, the duck thigh is lukewarm, soak in the so called red wine sauce. The duck taste bland too, and it is too dry and hard. and quite an obvious smell of frozen duck. Both dish is a typical example of, just assembling ingredients together in a plate, and called it a dish.Where has all the culinary goes?Paid about S$16 (before +10+7 %) for above each dish. Though the ambient is ok, but not worth the eat. For foreigners, there is a food centre just right behind Chinatown point mall, plenty of good food there, get a half chicken, or half a real roast duck, and eat your heart out."
French,Poulet,quick!,-1,30,5-May-15,i had the duck and my friend had the lamb. both dishes looked pretty much the same. however the meat was fall of the bone kinda good! Had the Rasberry lemonade which wa snice but the creme brule was really nice! Tiramasu is served in a canister and its alright.
French,Poulet,Salty and costly food,-1,20,10-Jan-15,"Maybe it's our taste buds. But both my wife and I found the food to be rather salty. We both also had a feeling of wanting to throw up after the meal. Customer service was bad. Before clearing the used plates on the tables, they brought in another set of food and there was no place to put them on the table. Water is chargeable at 50 cents per glass. Came with high expectation but going off with dissatisfaction. Total bill was rather costly for two pax. "
French,Poulet,Not the second time,-1,20,10-Jan-15,"I visited this place as I was craving for French food but it is not really serving the ""amazing"" French dish. The poulet rôti and baguette are just too local."
French,Poulet,Westgate Poulet is the branch that we will stay away!,-1,10,21-Dec-14,"Having dine in many different Poulet, never had major issue with other branch. When we dine in the Westgate outlet, their food was below expectation, some of the dishes were too salty. Service was horrified, they are under staff with poor management. This is one Poulet our family will stay away. "
French,Poulet,Inexplicably popular below-average restaurant,-1,20,30-Jun-14,"This seemed to be hugely popular with locals so we gave it a try. Sadly I can't understand for the life of me why it's such an attraction.The signature dish, chicken, is OK. To western tastes the standard cream & mushroom sauce will likely be far too sweet (I'm pretty sure it was mostly condensed milk, not cream) and although the chicken is OK it's nothing special and needs the sauce as the breast can be a little dry.The sweetcorn potato side order was tiny and tasteless, the fries were fine (though it's hard to screw those up) and the overall experience felt like bad hawker centre fare.Service wasn't brilliant, our starters were completely forgotten and when ""they"" arrived they had forgotten my order. In the end, looking at 4 limp frankfurters on a plate and thinking they were far from French garlic sausage I just let it go. Condiments have clearly just been scraped onto the side of the plate from the jar and left a lot to be desired on the appearance front. At least we were only charged for the one starter that was delivered.In a nutshell it wasn't dreadful but against the competition I cannot for the life of me understand why this place is still in business and, seemingly, so popular. Even bog standard chicken rice is nicer."
French,Poulet,Poulet at Bedok Mall,-1,20,21-Mar-14,"Poulet - the Amazing French Roast Chicken .... as the name suggests, this should be the place for chicken lovers..... but somehow, the taste, presentation etc suggest otherwise. Recently I went to the branch in Bedok Mall, and I order the latest signture dish which is half rosted chicken served in ""freshly home-made orange sauce"" with bacons and purple cabbage, and also ordered a garden vegetables...The moment the food arrive, found that the chicken seems ""hot"" and when tasted the sauce.... feel terrible.... the sauce is COLD... normally we would expect the sauce also comes in hot.... then mixing the chicken with the sauce is really a bad idea... On top of that, since it comes with ""bacons"" in the sauce we would expect also manage to eat the bacons..... but imagine in the whole plates, I only manage to find 1 bacon ..... and the size..... 2cm by 1cm... that is how TINY the bacon can be!!!! Paying such a price for this kind of dish ???Then comes the fresh garden vegetables..... and I would say it is so salty and the presentation really cannot make it... look at the pictures and you will know what I meant.The food was nowhere near French. The service was below average. I wouldn't recomment this to anyone. So far this is the worst western food that I've had in Singapore. that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing..."
French,Poulet,Quite nice overall,-1,30,14-Mar-14,"Heard of the rather new Poulet opening in Singapore, and heard mixed reviews, so Edison*, Katherine and I decided to scout it out for our dining pleasure over lunch one day.They have many outlets, we chose the one that was closer to our workplaces in general - 133 New Bridge Road, Level 2, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413. The number is 6538 3595. There was no queue, so we snagged a comfortable booth seat.The interior of Poulet is relaxing, done in light hues and cushy seats, setting the perfect ambience for casual comfort dining of classic French cooking techniques. The contemporary concept of wooden tables and modern classic chairs made the place ideal for friends, family, colleagues and dating couples alike.After some escargots and soups, we had the Poulet Roti - their signature roasted chicken in homemade Chardonnay Mushroom sauce. The golden brown skin was crispy, and the inside was tender and tasty. Infused with the very delicious gravy, we all understood why this dish tasted divine enough to be the restaurant's signature dish.Served alongside the Poulet Roti was the Pressure-cooked Oxtail in Red Wine Sauce with Carrot and Onion. The oxtail was very buttery tender it floated into the mouth and just disintegrated smoothly, we were surprised. The taste was heightened by the impossibly delicious red-wine based gravy.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-poulet-restaurant.html"
French,Poulet,"If there is a 0, I would put it .",-1,10,23-Feb-14,Poor food poor service . Food served cold . Over staffing but they still cannot give me some attention.
French,Poulet,Nothing Special,-1,20,13-Jan-14,THe name suggests that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing special or distinct about this place except for the name..... would not revisit again..... too many good options abound in this lovely city of ours to waste time and money on this.
French,Poulet,"poor food, lousy service",-1,10,3-Nov-13,"Ordered 2 lamb shanks with 1 chips and 1 gratin potato sides along with 2 latte's.Lamb shanks arrived after only about 5 mins, and though nice and tender were only warm. Had to start eating these as they were going cold and had to ask 3 times for our side orders which eventually turned up over 5 mins later., the fries were nice but the potato in the gratin was over cooked. got asked 3 times while waiting for coffees which were average if we wanted to order anything else. I also refused to pay the service charge for such bad service and food quality."
French,Poulet,Good food,-1,30,1-Nov-13,"Good environment, it was not full so the service was good.I had the ox tail stew. It was very good , maybe a bit salty but the taste and the portion size were good enough. I have tasted the lamb in another occasion, it was good also. I just don't understand the policy of not providing water, we need to buy whatever we want to drink."
French,Poulet,"poor food, worse service",-1,20,30-Oct-13,"This is actually about the Great World City branch to which I went with my wife before seeing a movie in same shopping mall. We chose to share a whole roast chicken - their signature dish, which they call poulet roti. It certainly wasn't worth anything near the S$38++ they charge. While the cooking was acceptable, although possibly slightly underdone, the chicken itself was of battery-hen quality, and tasteless. We asked for what they described as a baguette to go with it - but it turned out not to be a loaf of French bread but instead just four thin slices of toast, each no more than a few square centimetres. The drinks were similarly expensive - and even glasses of warm water were priced at 50 cents each. But the poor quality of the food and the inflated prices are not the main complaint. The service was outright nasty. We were treated in an offhand manner from the start, the waitress making no explanation of what was on offer. When the food arrived we asked for extra napkins, so she brought us a plate. We asked for mustard; but she had evidently never heard of such stuff, although she managed to bring some after going off to ask for advice from colleagues. Then - oops! - I upset a glass of Coca-cola, drenching the table and seats and soaking my trousers. There was no one around to help, so I stood and up shouted out; when nothing happened I shouted louder - ""someone, anyone, bring a cloth!"" The waitress was standing at a nearby table, chatting. I shouted louder, my wife stood up and shouted, and customers at other tables stared at us. The kitchen staff stopped work and stared at us, but the waitress stayed in her position, still chatting. Eventually, after what seemed like an age, but was probably less than a minute, the manager came over, helped clean up and took us to a fresh table. He didn't seem surprised when I said I wasn't going to pay the 10 per cent service charge."
French,Poulet,French? Really?,-1,30,23-Oct-13,"This new eatery seems to be highly recommended by many friends on my Facebook so I thought will check it out at Great World City. We had the Sautéed mushrooms, french onion soup, roast chicken in champagne (?) sauce, the lamb shank and tiramisu for dessert. None of them were particularly fantastic. Mushrooms were ok, the poach egg added an interesting twist but that's about it. The soup and chicken are too salty for our taste and the white sauce that comes with the chicken taste milky to me - weird. The lamb shank is not bad, very tender and flavorful but Secret Receipts does a similar one. I was really looking forward to the Tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts. Again didn't impress me much, find the sponge a bit too dry but the cream is good! Like some reviewers said they do charge for water which I personally find it ridiculous - even if it's refillable. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon. "
French,Poulet,Quite a dissapointment,-1,20,23-Oct-13,"I had a quick lunch here. I tried the signature roast chicken and some mashed potato as side. The service and the atomosphere were OK, but the food is not great. The chicken was served with thick cream sauce. The sauce was too thick and I felt bit sick of it after having half of them. The mashed potate was creamy, but again, the taste is too rich. I did not finish the dish.I do not think I will go back there. For the price I paid, I could have something better."
French,Poulet,"So unlike French chicken
So unlike good food",-1,10,23-Oct-13,My wife who is French and I visited this outlet and was shocked by the lacklustre taste of the chicken apart from a sickly soy sauce it was disgusting the mash was a milky liquid akin to syrupUnseasoned and unedible the veg was greasy and over cooked in all after nine years here we agreed the worst food we have hadDoes not even deserve one star To be honest absolute crap
French,Poulet,50 cents for water!,-1,10,10-Sep-13,This place is not cheap and even though our bill was over $50 they have the nerve to charge 50 cents for a glass of warm water. No class whatsoever. We will not be back and people should stop patronizing these small minded places. Is there no management?
French,Poulet,Less than mediocre; price does not match quality,-1,20,28-Jul-13,"I went here with average expectations - which unfortunately were not met. Everything on our table was sweet. The white sauce much-hyped chicken is much too sweet for our taste buds. The mashed potato is almost like creme caramel. For almost 30SGD for a main, side dish and soda, the price certainly does not match the quality. You have to pay 50cents for a warm water too - a disappointment considering that the food is already expensive as is. Do yourself a favor, and spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."
French,Poulet,Ce n'est pas terrible,-1,30,24-Jul-13,"We'd agree it wasn't too bad. The mains (duck, pork, lamb) were tasty. My baguette was a little stale and drinks were expensive. One of our party requested tap water (water is *recycled* in Singapore) and he was advised it's 50c a glass. We wondered how many diners would revisit after that lack of courtesy. Total cost was high, considering our order."
French,Poulet,Not too bad,-1,30,10-Jul-13,"I visited the one in Vivo City. I passed by it one day and there was a long queue, so I thought it must be good. Agreed with the previous reviewer that it could be too salty for some. I tried the Potato and Mushroom soup and the 'signature chicken"". I personally find that it's quite alright but not worth the queue i witnessed. The service was quite good though."
French,Poulet,Mass produced taste. Tries very hard to pass off as French.,-1,20,2-Jul-13,"Atmosphere is nice. Service is average. Price is very reasonable with good food quantity. However the dishes all tend to be on the salty side with their ""signature"" chicken taking the salt crown. Think of Poulet, think of Denny's."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Forgettable dining experience,-1,30,15-Oct-18,"A little french steak restaurant tucked away in tanjong pagar, this place serves my favourite combination of steak and fries.The portion was decent, the meat was tender and the fries that came with it was free flow. The wee burner that they kept our second portion of steak on did nothing, sadly. It was still room temperature The staff on duty made sure we got our second albeit small portion of steak, and also promptly topped up the sauce when we requested. In my opinion, there are other steakhouses which serves steaks that are just as good for at an even more competitive price and portion. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not worth if it’s a full price,-1,10,9-Oct-18,"The beef steak so so only, fries also normal with no dipping sauce. Poor service as staff seems more interested in giving their attention to foreigners than local!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Decent Steak!,-1,30,17-Sep-18,"The steak was well cooked but lady boss could be bit rude. We ordered a few mains to share, with a massive number of sides but she refused our request to top up for more fries as we were sharing mains *4 mains for 5 pax*. I'm sure the cost of our sides and desserts way exceeds the cost of another main. Don't blame her but it's just not very logical in our point of view."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Casual Business Lunch,-1,30,9-Sep-18,"Value for money due to promo, but steak didn't came hot , wish it was warmer,overall nice atmosphere."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Desserts were great but steak is so-so,-1,30,29-Aug-18,"Steak was so-so, sauce was lovely and escargots too. Best were the desserts! The caramel lava cake was heavenly. Service was sparse, hard to get their attention."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sides surpasses the mains,-1,30,25-Aug-18,"Designed to be quaint, it resembles any steakhouse in France during the 80s. The place is very compact, like our Europe counterpart, so if you suffer from claustrophobic, get those few tables that are lined opposite to the stretch of tables with benches.We were promptly served complimentary rose white wine, and subsequently our orders taken. We took foie gras terrine, extra salad and XL steak fries. The staff kindly notify us that XL steak fries do not get fries and sauce refills.The foie gras terrine was so good, so yummy, it was the deciding factor for us to come back to L'entrecote again. The salad was fresh, so were the walnuts that accompanied it. On a side note, the portion of the extra salad was very generous, much bigger than the salad that comes with the steak. Then comes the long awaited steak and fries. We ask the sauce to be on the side as I am not sure if i would like the sauce. Sure enough, my palette does not feel comfortable with the taste so i use it sparingly. We ordered medium rare for the steak, as we usually would. It tasted quite raw and chewy. It was not what i expected at all. I guess its a simple cut with a mediocre grade. However, those killer fries will definitely get you addicted, like it did for my diner. Fortunately we do not have free refills because the portion of the fries were sufficient to fill us up.I would come back again for the sides, not their steak."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing ,-1,20,10-Aug-18,"When you only have one dish cook it well!!Medium rare is very rare .... beware!Also why to restaurants bring appetisers and mains at the same time... school boy error, and then leave the main on the side to get cold before serving. Very poor."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was alright,-1,30,6-Aug-18,"Went slightly earlier before the dinner crowd and noticed that the staff were rather unfriendly and unattentive at first. Ordered the XXL to share and was informed that fries and sauce would not be unlimited since it was for sharing, which was fine as the amount of fries given was more than enough for us and they kindly served the entire dish in two plates. The tables in the restaurant were rather close to each other. So much so that another’s bum would touch our table while trying to get into their seat next to our table. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoy $50 Rubber Steaks Here!!!!,-1,10,23-Jul-18,"Absolutely terrible food. One of the worst meals I have had in DECADES. Steaks taste boiled. For those who truly know steak...Outback Steakhouse would be a DRASTIC improvement over this place-whats that tell you?. Food came out drenched in a gray sauce all smashed together with fries and a piece of steak that looked deathly underneath. After trying the food, we walked out laughing at what a poor attempt that was at being a restaurant and left to go to a legitimate steakhouse."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was good but felt cheated,-1,30,14-Jun-18,"Steak was great fries were even better.. However the staff asked me if i wanted water, and i said yes thinking it was non-chargeable.. before i could object she uncorked a bottle of evian water in front of my eyes. i looked down at the menu and was shocked to see it was $9! Foolish me for assuming water is free in an upscale european steakhouse, but still waitress could have been clearer and asked if i wanted bottled water."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A evening dinner,-1,30,11-Apr-18,"Very good service from the beginning to the end of the dinner, really nice atmosphere and ok location. The food was ok but not special. The prices not too bad. But all in all a positive evening."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,BAD FOOD HIGENE ALERT!,-1,10,22-Mar-18,"BAD FOOD HYGIENE alert!!!!!!!!! My date and I went to this restaurant tonight, was suppose to be celebrating his new job. The starter Foe Gras Terrine was served with a big patch of Green Blue MOULD!!!the waitress apologised to us a few times "" I'm sorry, I think that one was EXPIRED!"" let me get you another one from a new batch, like anyone would be just fine with eating the animal organ gone bad!!! I better don't get food poison in the next 24 hours, Or I will definitely report you. if it wasn't my date insisted to stay, I would have walked out of that restaurant, My appetite was completely ruined, and they charged us for that dish anyways, that's how sorry they were! Sick to the stomach literately, I wonder if the food in that fridge are as fresh as the terrine! and the FRIES are served in whole big plate, BUT there's no ketchup, mayo, no dip! you must eat the fries DRY!! yes it was so fantastic $100 SGD dining experience that's disgusting!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Really disappointing,-1,10,15-Feb-18,"Was really disappointed with this place. I booked one week in advance for valentines day via Facebook. The restaurant confirmed with me and i even followed up on the day to reconfirn, When I arrived there was no booking under my name and we were ushered to the end of a 6 seater table layout with them pulling the table at the end out slightly. We asked to be moved. The steak and fries. Probably the worst version of French steak and fries I have ever had. Fries tasted like they had been dripped in fat and someone had clearly gone a bit heavy with the lemon mixed in the sauce that covered the steak.We were given a complimentary drink once we had to asked to move and explained this was supposed to be a valentines day booking (albeit no record of it at the front desk).This restaurant claims to be one of the most romantic in Singapore hence the Valentine day booking. Apart from the decor and Duxton Hill settings, not sure how they can claim this magical status."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mixed feelings ,-1,30,25-Jan-18,I have been to this restaurant a number of times of the years. It feels like they still have the same ambitions but can’t really handle it. At the beginning of my dinner the service was top notch but as the place filled up I saw less and less of my waiter at the end they didn’t emptied the table before I got the check. Foie gras was ok the meat was ok the French fries was really good. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing steak,-1,10,12-Jan-18,"Went for the Christmas dinner menu with a friend and this is my first time there. This restaurant is supposedly special for their steak but it was chewy and bland. The very basic of salt n pepper rub prior to cooking the steak was not even reflected. The gravy was nothing to rave about either.Except for the fries and dessert, the meal was disappointing. Oh we had escargot for entree to share...again if there was no garlic butter cooked with the escargot the taste was bland. Understand you cannot get fresh escargot here but surely can be done better at this restaurant.We asked for tomato sauce for fries and they didn’t have...even the table next to us asked the same. Sometimes it’s not about what you want to serve but what the customer wants!!For the price they charge, I feel there’s better steaks out there.Decor was nice, French bistro feel but that won’t get me back there."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Wine a Let Down,-1,30,8-Jan-18,"The food is great and of course who cannot resist those fries!!!! But the wine list is dismal and very over-priced. We couldn't drink the first bottle we order (it wasn't corked, it was just terrible), so we ordered a different bottle. Because it wasn't corked we were not looking for a refund, but I would have expected the staff to inquire why we were not drinking the first bottle and asking them to clear it and the four barely touched glasses. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Terrible steak,-1,10,6-Jan-18,Didn't expect to pay $50++ for this kind of bad quality steak... it's worse than what we can buy from any supermarket (discounted value)..
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over rated steaks,-1,30,16-Nov-17,Steaks were not as tasty as we expected them to be. Over rated. Fries were addictive n good though. So was the bone marrow appetiser. The duck Rillete was a disappointment too.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very cramp restaurant,-1,10,13-Nov-17,My friend was made to squeeze in between tables with absolutely no assistance from the service staff. Horrible experience.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A pity they drastically reduced the portions ,-1,20,12-Nov-17,"Use to enjoy having a steak at the Entrecôte at Duxton every now and then but was bitterly surprised the other evening when we saw our steaks...considerably downsized! Really a pity because the location, ambiance and quality of food is good..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Average steak; nice fries though,-1,30,22-Oct-17,"L'Entrecote is a restaurant with many starter and dessert options but just 1 main dish - the signature steak and fries. So non-beef eaters take heed! For steak eaters, you have the option of the regular (~190g) or XXL cut (~300g). Steaks were disappointing though. The issue wasn't with the doneness of the steak, but rather the questionable quality of beef being used. The fries were good though.Given the variety of steakhouses around, would probably not return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner with Friends,-1,30,18-Sep-17,"The atmosphere of the Duxton outlet was great, had pretty high expectations after having a fantastic meal at their Suntec branch (now closed) a few years ago.They wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived but did make allowances when we mentioned that it was a birthday surprise and we would like to be seated before the birthday girl made her grand appearance. Ordering and the delivery of food was fast. We were told while placing our orders that those who were sharing the XXL steak meal weren't allowed to have free flow fries, something that we understood and were absolutely okay with. What we were not expecting was that those who shared meals were not allowed to request for extra sauce for the steak, this was pretty ridiculous to us as we felt that we should at least be able to request for 1 extra serving of sauce per set meal - further more the steak was bland. Did not expect this kind of skimpy service from a restaurant that I presumed was more upmarket.Overall had an average night at L'Entrecôte."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good service but food so-so,-1,30,20-Aug-17,"Guess the interesting thing about this place is that as the shop name denotes, you will have a Steak (done from rare to well done) and lots of fries as your main dish so no need to crack your brain trying to figure out what to order. They do have dessert and such. Service is fast and friendly."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unsatisfying Steak and Fries,-1,30,14-Aug-17,"This is the second time here, first time was a few years ago, however the quality and taste was a lot worser than the previous time. The sauce was more mustardy than the last memory there which didn't taste as nice. But the worst thing was that the steak was overcooked. Very light pink and no blood at all for a medium rare steak. And not to mention the really cramped seating :( This will be my last time visiting this place... "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok,-1,30,9-Aug-17,Ordered medium well steak but it came well done - too charred and tough. Complimentary drink was good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,quite good french foos in town,-1,30,7-Aug-17,"Food is quite good, do not expect the best at this price. Staff (filipinos) are warm, nice and efficient."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So so steak and poor hospitality,-1,20,6-Aug-17,"The taste of the steak was so so although it was nicely cooked according to our request. I am really disappointed with the super cramp space. The restaurant was actually empty but we were forced to sit at a table for two without no space to exit. The waiter refused to put us to a bigger table. When I asked why can't you push these tables so that we can have more space to get in and out our seat, the answer was simply ""this is our concept"". Then I replied...Oh it is your concept to torture your guest until we can't get out from our seat. If the restaurant was full, I would understand such refusal. However, it was very empty."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Below expectations,-1,20,27-Jun-17,"Was searching for a good steak house to celebrate Fathers day n since Lawrys only had available seating from 8 pm, i settled for this place after reading all the reviews.First of all for those driving, you must be prepared to wait as spaces are very limited.The place was small and cosy but aircon was very weak. Everyone around me was fanning themselves. Portion wise it was huge and they even came around with extras. But sadly none of us really enjoyed the steak. Maybe the meat was not of high grade so it was basically tasteless. Of course the sauce will cover it all but it was not enjoyable. Anyway wont be coming back any time soon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Average,-1,30,16-Jun-17,"Food is average and passes the average standard, but below our expectations given its price. Better steak places out there."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food,-1,30,5-Jun-17,"Space was abit too small. Tables were abit too close for comfort - would be great if they could distant them slightly. Nonetheless the steak definitely did not disappoint and we had a great evening. Not to mention, the staff were polite and sensitive to our requests. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not the same,-1,20,23-May-17,"Lovely area and attractive restaurant, steak quite good, sauce nothing like the original concept, fries dreadful, being presented with the bill without having to ask is great except when you haven't even been offered a look at the dessert menu."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing this time....,-1,30,16-May-17,"We have been to this restaurant many times, the steak was very disappointing this time we actually left most of it - such a shame as it was a birthday celebration meal"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinning experience,-1,30,5-May-17,Not crowded when we go In the afternoon. Service so so not the typical Italian or French restaurant service. If there's lunch set would be good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good steak, not as good as the one in Paris",-1,30,25-Mar-17,"The sauce not as smooth, the beef was also not as good. However overall still nice. Love the fries. The seating is very close in between chairs. Not a good place to have conversations."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Misleading,-1,20,11-Feb-17,"Food is not good. French fries at Mc Donald are better. Steak is OK. The pepper sauce is something... I don't know.
Being Belgian, you would expect in a restaurant pretending to be French some French food. Disappointing!
Environment is fantastic. Waitress was very kind!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Expensive food and so-so beef,-1,30,23-Jan-17,"Had their famous steak and fries, only their sauce was amazing. Steak was so-so, too chewy and not tender enough. Fries overly fried, if not for their steak sauce, everything was boring. Won't be coming back again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Awesome service but subpar food,-1,30,15-Jan-17,"Had very high expectations of the steak with their in-house sauce but had to say my partner and I did not enjoy the food. But, they had excellent service!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Very Average and Very Rushed Experience,-1,20,5-Jan-17,"The idea for this restaurant is a good one, but it is poorly executed. I agree with other reviewers about the patrons being packed in too close together. My main beef though (pardon the pun) is with the service. We were barely inside the door 15 minutes when our mains were served. This is really not on in a restaurant that is less than half full. Wine prices were steep relative to the modest quality of the food. The short point is this: the Duxton Road/Hill precinct is packed with better value options - you don't need to chance your arm here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,dinner on new year eve,-1,30,3-Jan-17,"tables were quite close but service were relatively good.
food was just average, steak and fries were served cold"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Bad ambience,-1,30,28-Dec-16,"Seat was packed too closely apart from each other, no personal space provided to diners. We ordered the beef marrow and two portions of steak; do not get the beef marrow, it was a waste of money($24?!)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible service!,-1,10,27-Dec-16,"Given a previous good experience at L’Entrecote, I decided to visit this place again for a Christmas dinner with my friends. However, both the food and service were highly disappointing. I will not be returning to this restaurant again. Food: Fries were good, beef was okay. It was definitely a lot better during my previous visit. Service: Unacceptable and poor service. The entire meal was so rushed it was like we weren’t welcome. - Over an hour, 2 servers asked me 5 – 6 times on whether I was done with my salad (though my plate was not empty & I was still eating)- Bread basket was not empty, server asked if they could take it back as they ran out of baskets (restaurant was not full, and we were obviously not done)- Asked to clear plates though there were still fries on them and we were still eatingWe made excuses for them and even thought through the different scenarios in which this could possibly be acceptable but nothing can hold. - Attentive service: They could be said to be really attentive. I was even appreciative the first few times they had asked. But multiple times when we are obviously not done – that’s not providing attentive service- Meal time limit: Understand this happens at some restaurants. But if so, this should’ve been mentioned during reservation or at the beginning of the meal. Nothing was said- Full restaurant with a queue outside: Restaurant had empty tables, no queue outside- Making space for other dishes: The table had more than sufficient space or nothing else was coming - Taking too long for our meal: We were there from 7pm to 8.15pm. I would think it’s normal to take 1 – 3 hours for a meal at a nice restaurant? We were there for slightly over an hour – more than within acceptable limits if there are any Overall, this was very disappointing. The food and service level has declined significantly and I will not be back again. For a similar price range, you can definitely get better food and service elsewhere."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is disappointing,-1,20,12-Dec-16,Steak is no good (probably a raw material issue) but sauce is tasty. Appetizer n dessert are yummy though. House red wine taste too plain. Since the main course is key overall dining experience is below average.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Over-rated,-1,30,29-Nov-16,The portion of the fries wasn't distribute well. Presentation was very bad. The whole chunk of fries over the steak. We wasn't told that there 2nd serving of steak. But the salad was very nicely done.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Poor service...food average for price.,-1,20,4-Nov-16,"Went there on a Friday night with friends. It started raining and although it had a covered tent, the rain was hitting the table. We asked to move to the same-name bistro bar next door that was empty, but they insisted on staying at our table and that the rain would not last long. The food took a very very long time to arrive and it was OK, but nothing to write home about. for the price, I will not go back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Never again!!!,-1,10,18-Oct-16,"Last night, we have made the unfortunate mistake of visiting L'entrecote. This is a place we have been couple of times and generally left satisfied since the menu is very standard and the quality of the steaks were good. Armed with our appetite for steak and fries, four of us decided to visit the place as a walk in customers. (Two other friends were on the way to join us for Cigars and coffee) The location doesn’t accept reservations and it was a Monday night so I was fairly sure the finding a table wouldn’t be a problem. When we arrived only three table were dining and place was at 10% capacity at best. We were to first to arrive and we told the host that we like to sit down and order some wine while we are waiting for our friends. We have been promptly told that we need to sit outside and wait until our full party arrives and until such time we won’t be permitted to sit down. Now, normally on a busy night, this would have been a reasonable request but on a night such as last one I considered this request to be unreasonable. After a brief argument with the host, we asked to see manager. She arrived promptly and repeated the “company policy”. Once we express our disappointment with the lack of initiative and flexibility on management site, manager simply said “I am just working here”. Well there can be a lot said about her response but suffice it to say, the owner didn’t do a good job neither empowering nor training his stuff. Just as we were deciding whether we should sit or leave and dine somewhere else the other couple arrived. At that moment the host, with a smirk on his face, told us “Now you can sit”. This was the tipping point. At that moment, I felt obligated to mention to the manager that this gentleman has no business working in service industry with such attitude and we left the place promptly and went to another restaurant. I think lack of initiative on management side, borderline rude host makes the food irrelevant and I won’t dare to expose myself and my friends to such an ordeal, so never again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed with the steak & fries,-1,20,20-Jun-16,Six of us went for dinner at their branch in Suntec. The medium raw steak is so tough it was a struggle to chew. Not worth the price. Also the fries were skinny.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice people but food very poor,-1,10,17-Jun-16,"The food was very poor, low quantity and bad quality! People nice but in the end you need to eat properly right?"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice staff, but the food disappoints a bit",-1,30,12-Jun-16,"We had entrecote, the only main dish on offer, which is all you need, if you have a craving for steak frites. Unfortunately, it didn't measure up - at least not to our taste. The ambience is great, the staff is nice and attentive and the wine list was good. Perhaps worth a try for those reasons, but there are better places to found. PS for those who like chocolate, their mousse is really, really good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good but not great,-1,30,19-Dec-15,"ive had the mussels and ive had the steak here, having been to its counterpart in paris i was expecting something on the same level but was a little disappointed. The mussels were very nice and came with bottomless french fries, however the steak was a let down, it was tough and rather tasteless despite the sauce.The service on the other hand was very good and everyone was very friendly.I'd go back for the mussels but not the steak. I've rated it average but only because there wasn't a ""good"" but i wouldn't go so far as to say ""very good"". It was also kinda of expensive, for that kind of money i was expecting a better meal."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Can do better,-1,20,24-Oct-15,"WellWhen the wine list is so limited and there is one aka 1 beer to select from there is trouble brewing especially when it's Stella !Food and service so so and the so called ""doneness"" varies it's always a challengeIf they sort the wine list and stock a few bottle beers there are possibilities !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Hmmm......not quite there !,-1,30,1-Sep-15,Went to the restaurant with 3 other friends.Chose to have their Wagyu steak which is supposedly their highlight. The steak was just OK. The meat was not as tender as expected and I found my self unable to chew the meat to the end which was not a pleasant experience.I like the price and the history of the place and hence would be willing to give it another go before I finally make up my mind.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed at the Suntec Mall l'entrecote... No return visit planned,-1,20,31-Aug-15,"I visited Duxton hill in 2012, was ok... So decided to try out their new opening in Suntec mall. My for end booked on line as you can do for the Suntec Mall one. That was the only decent thing that went well.On arrival, took time to find our table, they only sold Stella beer... No other beer, they had run out of gin ( I don't like Stella, but I'm ok to drink other stuff). Tasted the red wine on house... It was dry and tasted of vinegar, went for the 99$ red ( was meant to be a treat ) ... Turned it just drinkable. My starter of snails was good... My for ends starter of duck roulette was fat with a bit of duck taste ... It should have had more duck taste. The steak was fine but the sauce was over bearing.. Almost drowned it. It just felt a poor experience. Oh - amd if you have a nut allergy, stay away. We asked if one salad could be without walnuts... They brought it with, then took it away, my fore d discovered on eating it all they had done was pick the walnuts off as he found 2 at the bottom of his sale dish. Good thing he just hates walnuts and it's not a life threatening problem. All 3 of us at this restaurant were really disappointed... By food, service, amd ambience. Telling us the reason the food is slow as there is a baby fare upstairs in the mall did not impress us either..... We could not see any connection. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Boring place,-1,20,28-Aug-15,"They just served entrecotte. It's not bad, but the last time i was there the price was higher, so I'm not coming back anymore."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty - Good Concept,-1,30,12-Aug-15,Tasty lunch - very tight seating. Steak was tough though. IF you wish a great steak meal - try another place before L'entrecote.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec outlet - avoid this place,-1,20,25-Jul-15,"This is my second visit as I was not impressed at all on my first. And again, service is slow, inattentive and staff seem disgruntled when handling customers (come on, no smile?) Service in this ""bistro-like"" establishment, with servers wearing shirt, vest and tie looks awkward with ""mahjong"" paper as table cloth. Frankly, if you are running it like a bistro, make sure your staff don't look atas, serve atas and talk atas (atas meaning proud) cos you are not fine dining...Waiting time for main course (with a half full restaurant) is 20-30mins. Frankly, I will not be back. No wonder pepperoni next door is always full (and with queue) and Entrecote is always half full. For the price I am paying for the entrees and main course, there are many places around here to dine. Avoid this place"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec - Food Good, Service A Disappointment",-1,20,14-Jul-15,"In spite of the negative comments on service we ate here as we wanted a ""beef fix"" and it was very convenient to our hotel. Steak was cooked perfectly, sauce excellent and the fries were well-prepared, almost perfectly salted. But the service? Our watiress didn't seem to know what service meant; when our daughter wanted a slight change to the pasta beneath her salmon she didn't know what to do and pushed-back to a a change at first, then commenting that it was odd (daughter wanted pasta tossed in garlic butter rather than a cream sauce). Never refilled empty water glasses, when plates were cleared I counted at least 22 times that she walked passed our table and never asked if we were interested in cofffee, dessert or the check. When I spoke with the hostess she tried to rectify by offereing free dessert (she comped corkage on our wine instead as we wanted to leave) but also seemed well-aware of the issue. The owners need ot address this. There are plantly of similar comnents, and the staff is impeding sales in a busy area where several hotels could feed service if the concierges were in a position to recomment the restaurant. I know I shared my experiece with the Conrad concierge."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Could be much better,-1,20,24-Jun-15,"Visited the outlet in Suntec (near the fountain) for lunch today. Opted for the steak and fries, which came with a salad as a starter. Food was bland and unappealing and the steak wasn't anything particularly special. The restaurant was only about half full at lunch time which perhaps should have been a bit of a sign of the quality to be expected. Total cost for 2 was about $50 which I guess was ok. Overall it could be much better and it's honestly hard to recommend."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mediocre food,-1,30,24-May-15,"I had lunch here with a bunch of people. I found the food mediocre. Had the salmon steak dish. I found the salmon a little tasteless and the sauce lacking. Ambience was okay (went to the Suntec branch) and service was relatively alright. Underwhelming experience, wouldn't return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Decent Meat, Average Service",-1,30,15-May-15,"Certainly doesn't compare to L'entrecote in other countries, but it's the best Singapore has to offer. Not generous with 2nd servings, and they refused to let me take my leftovers home for my dog because they were scared of liability (food poisoning), even if it was for animal consumption. I even gave consent and accepted the consequences but they still wouldn't let me do a doggy bag. Not a happy customer, but if you're craving L'entrecote- go here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinner,-1,10,12-May-15,Food cold bland and not fresh. Not worth the money. Main course came before even 1/2 way through starter. Service way to quick
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French Farce !,-1,10,29-Apr-15,"Having eaten at entrecôte in Paris and london this place is a complete shambles. Whilst waiting for a steak meal it is customary in France to receive a bread basket. When one dos not appear we questioned this and the response came ""it's only given on request "" The green salad has an awful citric dressing unlike the beautiful creamy vinaigrette in France and london. Then came the steak with an inadequate sizzle of the famous house sauce. We asked for more and were told we would be charged 3 dollars for it. (Despite a bill of over 100 dollars for two )Then came the profiteroles. A usually delicious and indulgent dessert ... Again this came with a pitiful dribble of choclate sauce on it. Needless to say we did not ask for some more sauce this time ! The whole experience was soulless and petty. We felt we were part of their profit making mathematical sum. No passion. Just a mere business. If it hurst them so much to bring out the food, I suggest they put their mathematical skills in another line of business"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak Frites Supper,-1,30,23-Mar-15,"Nice location on Duxton Hill. This restaurant only serves Steak Frites for the main course and there is a choice of 2 sizes. The steak and chips were average, the salad was excellent as were the starters."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing,-1,20,5-Mar-15,"I had heard a lot about this place and on arrival in Singapore some work mates suggested we meet there. It started well with a kir on arrival and some delicious l'escargot but the steak was sinewy and covered in sauce. Way too rich especially when topped by a mountain of fries which, I am a sucker for, but made the whole thing unappetising. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Sorely Disappointed, Waste of Money",-1,20,22-Feb-15,"I had high hopes for this restaurant as they have one entree of steak and fries I expected it to be excellent..it wasn't. The steak is from a cheap cut and the sauce they serve it with has an overpowering taste of lemon, it was terrible.Only good thing were the fries which unfortunaye they refuse to serve with ketchup which i would have forgiven them for if the steak sauce was at least tasty!I will definitely not be returning!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,From top to flop,-1,20,17-Feb-15,"It makes me sad to write this review as I was visiting l'entrecote since it opened. However, I realised that the quality got worse over time. My very last experience yesterday was quite special indeed. When I sat down at the table the guys on the table next to us warned us not to order as the food is terrible. Sounded like a very strong word to me so we decided to go ahead. I had bone marrow as a starter (as always), which was within my expectations. However, the salad was served at the same time, which was quite quite special (especially given the fact the the service was exceptional in the beginning). Later on when the entrecote was brought to the table I saw immediately that my rare is not rare but medium well as they meat is already carved. I tried a bite and realised no matter how this meat is cooked it wont be one of my enjoyable. I mentioned to the staff the overdone meat. She offered to get me a new serving, which I rejected due to the fact that it takes another 10 to 20 minutes and my friend already had his food. My disappointment was the fact that I was served carved meat. It's one look and the chef or the staff serving would have realised it's overcooked.Anyway, this was the first time in probably over 20 years (or possible ever) that i did not finish a steak. I felt very sad as I had quite a few good dinners with friends at l'entrecote and I knew the moment I walked out that i will not be back soon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Started so well, these days they are lost.",-1,20,27-Jan-15,"I have visited L'Entrecote the first day it opening and a number of times since. The 1st 6 months were great, good service, good food, absolutely no complaints. Then it all started going downhill.I visited sporadically over the last few years to see if they had improved but I am constantly disappointed. The service is bad, the servings are definitely not what they used to be. The food/sauce that made it famous has changed, cold servings .... all in all I will never return.So sad."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Service is SHOCKING,-1,20,23-Jan-15,"So having been ti the Duxton Hill restaurant and throughly enjoyed it we thought we would try the Suntec City outlet. OMG what a shocker. It was a Friday evening and we had made reservations for 18:30. The restaurant was pretty much empty at that time so we were shown to our table and ordered sparkling water at S$9++ per bottle. OK no worries. We then ordered a bottle of house red which came as a non descript wine that just said L'entrecote 2013 Bordeaux. No other information. We asked the waitress for more information about the wine...needless to say...CLUELESS!Anyway..main course. We ordered the large Steak Frites (S$39.90++). I ordered medium and my wife ordered well done. We were served the complimentary walnut salad with consisted of a plate of greens with 3 half walnuts on the side. When the main course arrived I was aghast to see my wife's steak was actually medium rare and mine was rare. We immediately called over the waiter and explained that the steak was not cooked as per our order. When we told him we ordered well done and medium he suggested we had ordered the wrong thing and that for medium we should have ordered well done and for well done we should have ordered extra well done. I was shocked. I laughed at his suggestion and told him we we're not eating this and that he should take it away and we want it cooking as we originally ordered...he took it away and 10 minutes later he returned with the exact sam plates and the steak had clearly been placed in a microwave oven, the steak was incredibly tough at this point. We spoke to the waiter once again and told him we were not happy with the meal. He then said he would ask the manager to come and speak with us....LOL!...The manager arrived...some young french girl who had clearly never even managed a greasy spoon cafe let alone managed a restaurant! She asked what was the problem and we explained the whole sorry saga again. She asked did we want a replacement to which we replied ""yes"". 23 minutes later we had a replacement meal. Mine was ok, however my wife was still cooked medium. At this point we thought f k it. We ate what we could and decided to pay and leave. At the checkout the manager (Estelle) gave us our bill (S$158) and never once asked us was every thing ok. I mentioned this to her and she said she didn't ask because her view was if we didn't complain again then everything must have been ok. Her arrogance was beyond belief. Even though the Duxton Hill experience was great, we will never go to either again because of the terrible service at Suntec City.BE AWARE!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TERRIBLE ARROGANT SERVICE"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Had bigger expectations of this steakhouse,-1,30,11-Jan-15,"I spent some time reviewing steak restaurants before settling upon L'Entrecote. The restaurant itself is a great little place, in Duxton Hill, and the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant was fabulous, quaint old lights, walls lined with bottles. Very atmospheric. The menu is simple but expected. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Regrettably the food however, was not quite up to expectations. The French onion soup was piping hot, and looked every inch like a tasty bowl of soup, but unfortunately there seemed to be very few onions and it was quite watery, definitely not what I was expecting. The steak came with the sauce poured all over it. I did not appreciate this, I had expected this to be in a separate jug so that I could pour. I did not enjoy the sauce but that is my taste I guess. The steak was quite tough and chewy and disappointing. Such a shame as the restaurant looked so promising. My usual test of a good restaurant is whether I would pay a return visit. In this instance I'm afraid not."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sadly dissapointed,-1,20,7-Jan-15,Cold plates with thinly sliced steak is always a bad start. Tough meat also. Over priced wine. Had the impression that the nice people working there had never tasted their own food. On a positive not the chips were good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good lunch set menu,-1,30,2-Jan-15,"I ate there with my wife and 4 year old child. We were there during lunch time within a festive week. It was quite easy getting a table. The whole place was pretty empty.Interestingly, the hostess seat us one table away from a couple having a meal and conversation. The whole place was empty and actually through out the meal I was a bit concerned about my son making noises and disturbing the couple. The hostess could have seated us better.The food is so-so. We ordered 3 entres. Only one of them the ""Duck Leg"" is delicious. We ordered Creme Brulee for desert and it doesn't taste nice at all.The overall environment is alright and the staff seems friendly and eager (although only two tables were occupied when we were there).I would come back again but only after I tried the other places nearby."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L'Entrecote Suntec City - Not so French afterall,-1,30,20-Dec-14,"Have randomly chosen this restaurant as lunchtime crowd in Suntec was really busy then on a Saturday. This was one of the only few restaurants that did not look busy probably due to price since French food?? We were initially attracted by their lunch set meal - burger set. In the end, we ordered escargot as starters, main course : seabass and duck confit with rice. We like the seabass and their famous butter sauce the best. The duck confit was alright except can see visible fats from the thigh which can be a turn off. Escargot was bland. They were not generous with bread though. The coffee was terrible as a glass of wine is expensive. The restaurant is a fusion of French/American with loud music playing in the air. I can see mostly expats with mix of Asians and children are allowed in the restaurants probably due to the casual setting. The service staff looked busy and stress. The table like French setting but the whole room/atmosphere looks very casual. Dark with spotlights all over. The restaurant has potential but I think they can improve on their concept better."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Frites,-1,20,11-Dec-14,"Went for an early dinner and it was fairly empty...so got a table easily. The restaurant filled up rapidly after that, so going early is best.Had an onion soup for starters and although the bread and gruyere topping was good, the soup easily was thin and on the salty side.Main course was of course steak and frites. My heart sank when I saw the steak drenched in the house ""secret"" sauce. A great steak is never dunked in sauce. I asked for the steak to be done medium rare, but it came close to medium. The steak beneath the sauce was stringy and had tendon. It was tender but lacked taste. And I couldn't make out the direction of the sauce.Dessert was their lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let's just say the highlight of the meal was the ice cream, not the cake and everything leading up to dessert.A very forgettable meal in the guise of a French bistro. The proprietor of this restaurant seriously needs to rethink the preparation of the food. But then it could just be me because the restaurant was full when I left."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec L'Entrecote - What a shame....,-1,10,30-Nov-14,"In the kitchen of L'Entrecote is a man who can cook. Unfortunately, the person managing front of house has the organisational capability of a shaved monkey. It was so bad it was funny. Ordered a glass of champagne and some wine. Champagne was flat - clearly the bottle had been open for too long. we told them and asked for a replacement... answer: ""we've run out of champagne for the day"" ..? My pate and Fin's ceasar salad arrived. 15 mins later, H's soup ""was still being prepared"". We cancelled the soup and suggested our main courses come together. Mine arrived after 10 mins. No sign of the other two. 10 mins go by.... the 3 of us ate my very well cooked steak and chips and as we finished, the two burgers arrived. To make the experience worse. We tolerated service that would have caused a riot in a badly managed prison and watched two of the staff enjoying a leisurely lunch whilst the restaurant remained in chaos. Do not ever, ever, ever eat in the is restaurant until you read reviews confirming the manager has been taken in to the basement carpark of Suntec and put out of his misery."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Bad imitation of L'Entrecote,-1,20,25-Nov-14,"Lunched at the Suntec City branch. Rather pretentious maitre d', food is average, the sauce is not at all authentic, weird head-banging music playing too loudly. No .... won't be back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,I waited 30 mins for my steak!! Lousy service.,-1,20,21-Nov-14,I was at the Suntec branch on a friday evening. We were served our appetizer and had to wait 30mins!!! for our mains to arrive. The service was terrible due to they were full house and were shorthanded. The tables who arrived later than us were served their mains much earlier than us. They forgot about our orders. We had to keep asking them for our food. It was mad. I used to visit quite often but would like to avoid after this eventful day. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cheap is Cheap gets,-1,10,20-Oct-14,"Great location. Thats it! There is a saying in Singapore, trying to find value invariably leads to disappointment. This place fits that bill. Its also destroying the brand!Not sure any of the staff know a chateaubriand from their rump - or where France is! Sadly the manageress doesn't seem to care! Needs a pull through from the top down. Until then - AVOID!There is better value for money elsewhere in Duxton. Better aperitif, better food, better wine and certainly better service! Great food and service to be had at Latteria and La Maison Fatien."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not even close to the L'Entrecote standard,-1,20,19-Oct-14,"Unfortunately, my visit was kind of a disappointment. I have always enjoyed their sister restaurants in London, NY and Geneva but the standard at the Singapore restaurant isn't even close to it. First of all is the air conditioning not working properly so the temperature is uncomfortable. Tables are to narrow to each other and waitress acts like first day at work. The meat, fries and famous sauce is not even close to the standard. Avoid"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak and fries,-1,30,25-Sep-14,"We dined at their Suntec City branch. This restaurant was recommended by a friend and we really came here just for the steak and fries, which didn't disappoint. It was not the best steak but was pretty good. It was cooked according to our preference and I was a big fan of the sauce.I also ordered a glass of their red wine (Bordeaux) which went perfectly with the steak. For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel lava cake which was also pretty good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Didn't even step in and already a bad impression.,-1,20,12-Jul-14,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec **The only reason why I'm rating this restaurant as ""Poor"" and not ""Terrible"" is because I didn't even step foot into it, so I can't judge for the food or atmosphere. I rang up for a reservation on a Friday evening and I got a guy telling me that their reservations were full. Even before I could ask if I could walk in to try for a table, he said, ""OK. Bye."" and promptly hung up.I understand that Friday nights are busy but this was incredibly impolite. If the service is like that on the phone, I dread to think what it's like in the restaurant. I'm avoiding this place at all costs from here on."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French fast food restaurant,-1,20,10-Jul-14,"We dined at the Suntec city restaurant. It took them about 5 min to serve our food after the order was taken. Seems like the food were pre-cooked. We had the Onion soup which was lukewarm and bland, tasteless pasta salmon, think slice of steak which was not worth the price ($29.90) - was cooked medium well when we requested for medium rare, Escargots and Salad Nicois. It seems that they were in a hurry for us to finish our meal even thought there were only few diners. Before I could finish my soup, the salad was served. Service was really poor. And for a French restaurant, they do not even have a soup spoon. It was a bad dining experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok food. Horrible service. Terrible air conditioning,-1,20,5-Jul-14,"Food is ok. Thin slices of meat. However, the air conditioning is horrible. It was so hot that we had to move outside for dessert. Service is also bad as no one tended to us when we moved outside to get better air. We could have stood up and walked away. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unethical.,-1,10,15-Jun-14,"One word summary: Unethical.Visited the suntec outlet on Father's day hoping to have a nice time with my wife and my parents. Food was ok, service was bad and I think what you guys are doing with the still water is plain unethical. $18++ for water that I didn't want is ridiculous. When I asked the cashier why I was being charged $18 for water, she said that's the price of their product. Yeah sure, I wasn't given a choice for any other option. I was asked ""sparking or still""? You even opened a 2nd bottle without asking. Cost wasn't made known either. It should be made known that there is also an option of ""ice water"". You may defend and say we didn't ask. Sure, you make my $18 now but no matter how good your food is, and it really isn't, I'm never going back again. Neither are my friends. Ask yourself if it's worth it, since you're pretty new to Suntec. No wonder you changed FB page when your previous FB page has so many 1 star reviews. You may say other restaurants do this too, unfortunately you don't command the status, neither is your steak Wolfgang Puck quality, your price isn't $650, so don't try charging lay people who just wanna have a $20+ father's day dinner $18 for water. Feel free to explain your style of management and bad service.PS. Your ""still"" water contains high amounts of sulphate and doesn't even taste that great."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not my idea of a good steak but may appeal to others,-1,30,12-Jun-14,"My French colleagues told me they quite liked this place so I went ahead and organised a group dinner there. As we were in great company with overseas visitors and old friends, we were able to have a good evening despite the shortcomings. I in particular (and a young visitor from Bangladesh who has been to France) did not quite appreciate the steak, neither the sauce. I heard some reviewers say that the steak was huge but mine was small, thin (cut in six slices) and bland on its own. I asked for the sauce to be served separately as I was told it has a rich sourish taste and did not want it drowning my steak in case I did not like it. True enough, it was too sourish (like yogurt sour) and very rich (probably a lot of butter). The French in our group were quite happy with the steak although only 2 (out of the 7 in the group) were offered second helpings. And we were not offered additional fries until most of us were quite done with our meals and the ones who wanted had to ask after more than 15 minutes into the meal. The 2 waitresses were very sombre looking and just did their work robotically with no warmth and no smile. The 2 waiters were a bit better, more trying to be efficient than being friendly. The desserts were good especially the Salty Butter Caramel Lava Cake although it was too sweet. The profiteroles were a tad dry probably from being in the fridge? The cost of the appetisers and the desserts were equivalent to those in hgher-end restaurants so in the end the bill still did amount to quite a lot. I guess on my part, this is not how I like to eat steak. Perhaps one needs to first appreciate and really like the sauce and opt to have the steak rare or medium so that the taste of the sauce is absorbed by the meat. Otherwise, this is not the place for you as there is only one main course option. And this restaurant advocates a 'no reservation policy' and they also will not give you a table until your whole group is present (or at least most of them)."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not like the original,-1,30,7-Jun-14,"I went there with my friends expecting the same experience as we had at L'Entrecote in France and the UK but got disappointed. The classic dish was made different here. Salad had a simple vinaigrette sauce with whole walnuts thrown on top instead of the creamy/ Caesar dressing w cut walnuts mixed together. The meat was ok but the sauce was very different. This defeats the purpose of this style of restaurant where you expect consistent quality and taste in any outlet across the world. Ah, and as other people already said, service is just about average. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Let us finish the starter before serving the main course !,-1,20,1-Jun-14,"Having frequented the Relais de Venise in Paris, I was excited to try L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill in Singapore. Despite having to queue at any time of the night and any day of the week, the Parisian restaurant never failed to deliver in terms of food, service, ambiance and overall experience. Clearly I was expecting too much from the establishment in Duxton Hill.The online menu boasts 'an unlimited supply of crisp, golden French fries complimented by our hand selected L’Entrecôte red wine'. Perfect. I ordered the Entrecôte steak with its legendary sauce, golden French fries and walnut salad, and a carafe of the L’Entrecôte house red wine. The waitress apologised that they had run out of the house wine and invited me to make another selection. Surprised, I asked her to please check and she returned 5 minutes later with a carafe of what I assume was the house wine.The walnut salad arrived but was very uninspiring. Nevertheless I was half way through eating it when the waitress arrived with my steak. Without saying a word she picked up my salad as I was eating and moved it the other side of the table and plonked the steak down in front of me, and then swiftly left. 'But, but,...'. The steak was good, the sauce was good. It was only 10 minutes after I had finished my meal that the waitress asked if I wanted more fries. I informed her that I had already finished my meal 10 minutes ago. She walked off.Later she returned and asked if I had finished with my salad. I informed her that I was still eating it when she brought the main course. She walked off.Meanwhile, a young couple had arrived and were enjoying their walnut salad at the table opposite me. They were newly dating and engrossed in each other's company, only picking at their meal between animated conversations. Keen to learn whether my experience was an unfortunate one-off or common practice for this restaurant, I stayed to observe.Sure enough, before they had finished their salad the main course arrived and their salad plates relocated. I noticed a mild look of astonishment on their faces, but they were in love and nothing was going to spoil that.By this time the restaurant was half full, and rather sterile with no ambiance whatsoever, and certainly with no need to rush the customers through. I declined the desert on principle and promptly left with no intention of returning."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec Outlet - Good Food, Service ruins Experience",-1,30,21-Apr-14,"Just came back from a meal at the Suntec Outlet, didn't quite feel like it was money well spent due to the service.The food was good. Had the escargot, mussels, beef tartare, duck confit and the steak frites. They were all done well. The escargot was flavoursome, mussels were cooked just right, duck leg was falling off the bone, steak done just right. I don't see why there is a need to have excessive mounds of fries on just about every dish. Looking around, I didn't see many polished plates because of the sheer amount given.The service was sorely lacking. It started out okay, water was promptly served. However we had to get them to bring more menus for my family who arrived after me and had been seated for over 10mins. They have this thing where they write your order on the paper table covers. We were told that this was so when the dishes arrived, the servers know where each dish went at the table without having to ask who ordered it. It didn't matter anyway, we were still asked.We wanted mussels to share as a starter (it's listed as a main). After confirming twice, my escargot arrived without the mussels. We were asked a couple of times if we had been served, which was nice but nothing came back from it. And we had to call for attention to ask about it a few times more. Half hour later, they came. It was all down hill from here. Forget that we poured our own wine, and water was rarely topped up. It seemed like the wait staff and kitchen staff do what they like and not what is requested. After a while of trying to get the wait staff over and to ask for water, she preferred to start clearing our table first instead. Clearing and serving opposite the seated person at the table isn't quite nice, conversations were interrupted quite a bit because of it.We were never asked how our meal was, and the icing on the cake? We finished our meal just after 9pm, i asked for the bill from the staff topping up water in our glasses, which went ignored, then I failed at at getting anyone's attention.. They were busy setting up the tables for the next day and shutting down. I looked over at the bar, I see the manager on his laptop looking at facebook. Gave up and decided to go to the counter to make payment. Nevermind the lack of serivce attention, but Facebooking when you still have guests in? Pretty bad if you ask me.I'd be cautious about going because of the service, which isn't good when the place was about 75% full (at this time could be forgiven), but it gets worse when it's pretty empty."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is ok but not for something else,-1,30,15-Apr-14,"I have a dinner at L'Entrecote today.I ordered medium rare and agree that their streak is good. But the bad part is their appetiser and desert. I had leek and vinaigrette. It was good if I went to some friend who might be just start cooking. The leek was very hard and sticky, not anywhere near tender. The vinaigrette was added with chopped shallots. Too sour and not tasty. The desert I ordered lava cake which was put on the menu is desert of the house. The cake is almost like rubber and inside lava have a rock solid of un-melted caramel. Service is average.Unimpressed !All-in-all. Steak is good but don't think about something else."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,way over rated,-1,10,3-Apr-14,"i was here to celebrate my birthday but the experience was not a celebratory one. The service was sloppy where the waiter served my dish by dropping it instead of placing it in front of me and he did the same over my shoulder across to my friends and had to ask several times before getting our water glass refilled.I had onion soup as starter and it tasted really blend. When i asked the waiter about it, his reply was that many customers did feedback that it's watery but that's the 'style' of their soup and that is why they placed salt and pepper on the table for us to season it ourselves.Their singular main course which is steak was tender and portion was generous but it tasted blend and I had to depend on their 'winning formula secret sauce' for flavour, which is sourish."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A real let down,-1,10,17-Mar-14,"Went with great expectations, however food can be described as poor at best. Worst steak i have ever eaten, undercooked and tasteless. The sauce was so overpowering i thought i was eating lemon curd. The bill was 130 sing and money not well spent. A great shame as on our door step and grossly overrated!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Can not understand the hype about it!,-1,10,26-Feb-14,"I arrived alone in the evening around 8pm, got a table pretty quick.Did not like it though as it was of course under a aircon duct, but no other choice so I accepted.Then the waiting started... tables around me started to get filled and orders were taken.I was left aside, after 10 minutes they took my order too. Staff is very very unprofessional and my waiter had missing teeth... eeeehhh? Please who hired him to serve in a restaurant... OMG.I ordered the large entrecôte, medium. Arrived after 15 minutes. Fries were almost cold and the meat only a little warmer.Did not want to complain as I was hungry. The meat was ok but thats it. Fries as well...Sauce, whats the hype about this sauce? Every house made béarnese sauce is better. The house wine at 10 SGD is a rip off, well okay as wine in Singapore in general. Asked for the check and got more money back than supposed to.Okay I accepted with a smile and went away. The cashier takes the total amount of the bottom, which is the total of the bill... The due change is somehow in the middle. Hope thats not their rule otherwise the owners will not be happy.Would I recommend? Well if you like a fast food steak yes, if you like quality no.Its comparable to the lousy steaks of Outback in Singapore. Anyways what happened to Outback? They were top dollar some years ago..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good burger, so-so steak",-1,30,22-Dec-13,"It was either this, or Wendy's. Loved the fries, steak was not that great, burger was juicy. Will probably come again, if Wendy's was the other choice."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nothing special,-1,30,12-Nov-13,"Just what they say, entrecotte and fries. Not specially good, neither bad. Service is better than food, what is actually strange in Singapore.
Only go if you really need to eat a steak and don't know any other better place... But there is a lot."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,You better like steak!,-1,30,3-Oct-13,"Service was good, steak was as expected, fries were amazing!
Bit too cozy with tight table seating but I'll take that over having to wait longer"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pretty disappointing lunch experience,-1,20,3-Oct-13,"Went during lunch-time, it was one of the few places in the Suntec dining hall with no line for entry.We lingered at the front for a short while before a waiter finally paid attention to us and then pointed us towards an assortment of available tables.It then took them a very long time to come and take our order, and we were not served water without asking.The place tries to have an image of being posh but seemingly doesn't know if it is a restaurant or more of a cafe.We ordered the lunch special burger ($14.95++). Food arrived in a timely fashion and mine was not bad, but my colleague's was well under done. When we asked them to re-do it, the waitress tried to claim it was medium, when it was obviously rare. (we also weren't asked what temperature we wanted the burgers cooked to).The re-did the burger and it was fine afterwards.The cheque came quickly!Overall a pretty disappointing and drawn out experience. the food was fine, but really unless the meat is some A-Grade I was not aware of, you couldn't had a more fulfilling experience at McDonald's"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So disappointing!,-1,20,21-Sep-13,"Really loved this place on previous visits. This time was such a let down. Firstly, they rushed us so that it felt as though we were in MacDonalds. We had barely sat down before we were hassled to order, and then the main course turned up before we had even started our salad. Clearly just wanted us out so they could get the next bill-payers in our seats! The steak was not great - which is supposed to be their selling point. Th house wine, which was pretty good and robust last time, has been changed and felt like a $50 rip off. Has the place changed management? Need to concentrate on quality rather than bums on seats or whill soon lose their reputation and customers. Sad!!!!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Place ok,-1,30,12-Sep-13,"Do not go L'Entrecote if you expect to eat a top quality meat.The starters they have are relatively good, we had the foie gras et pate de campagne.But what to say about the main course.Not the beef you would expect to get in a french restaurant.In addition to that the service is not the most friendly you could find."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Terrible steak given its the only main meal,-1,20,10-Sep-13,My steak was tough as old leather. Really quite amazed this place can stay in business given this is the ONLY main. Entrée was great but wont be visiting again. Seating very crampe. d
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible,-1,10,9-Sep-13,"Horrible food as I would like to say. The meat on the steak was very hard to chew on and it was quiet hard to swallow as well. I have been to l'entrecote in paris and it was very different from what i expected to have in singapore. I was very disappointed as the steak was too overcooked and the meat that was supposed to be juicy has lost all the juiciness. There was also lack of sauce that accompanied the hard meat steak and when i asked for more sauce,they would like to charge SGD5 just for the sauce. I wouldn't recommend to dine there although i saw many more of the menus. The main attraction of the course as in the paris is the steak and fries with the special sauce but nothing was special as it was in singapore. Very disappointed"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Starting from the start...,-1,20,13-Aug-13,"Starting from the start.. We called to make a reservation but apparently they did not accept any, so we got there early to try to get a table. Sat outside for over 45min with little to no update from staff. Placed our orders and very specifically asked that for the steak sauce be served on the side to which the wait staff noted and affirmed. I ordered the Homemade duck foie gras terrine.. my bad for not asking what terrine meant (I was expecting the pan friend type). All the same, it was average at best. Free flow of fries as advertised.. nothing to complain about there. Great if you like your carbs. The steak was a different story. The Steaks:The quality of the steak itself was just a little better than the stuff u get at foodcourts. Tad larger but if you are the kind of person that really savours your cow, you will know that true quality wasn't even average.Next, the website advertised 2 servings of steak. Naturally we were expecting a second portion to come at some point only to be told that they had put the equivalent of both portions on our 1 serve - 200g topS! . SERIOUSLY?! Why would you advertise 2 servings, a) serve our ""2 portions"" in a single serving, b) that was really less than the size of one standard portion anywhere in the world, c) without our asking, d) shrug us off when we ask, e) then go ahead to the next door table to provide their second serving??! why?The plus side imo is the sauce. It is a pretty tasty sauce that the steak is apparently cooked in. I must say that I suspect it plays a major part in the other good impressions of this place because it completely masks the actual meat quality. Oh but wait... didn't we ask for sauce on the side?!So heres the thing, my sister is gluton intolerant (just shy of Celiac disease). So here came the steaks all soaked in sauce right? When we raised the point that we had requested all sauce to be served on the side, guess what, the gave her a portion with the sauce just flicked or wiped off. Naturally we called the lady manager again who flicked us off again and just said ""its not our policy to serve with sauce on the side"". Seriously?! policy? firstly your staff should not have acknowledged and accepted our request if it wasn't policy. Fine staff will be staff. You most certainly should not have just wiped off the sauce and served it all the same. Yes YOU because you were solely responsible for distributing the meats from the platter that came out of the kitchen. Also, saying 'not our policy' and trying to walk off before a customer can respond is completely unacceptable. I accept your subsequent apology after nailing your bottom to the floor as to whether you or your restaurant would bear the medical consequence of a gluten caused reaction by my sister. I guess its hard to worm you way out of it when public liability is involved. The starters aren't too bad relative to price relative terms. Think of this place as budget french dining with budget staff, fantastic sauce and lousy cow. Oh ya.. and cramped.. very tight space. Please tell me if you disagree... we'll have our doctors assist you with your query."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,More about the service,-1,10,20-Jun-13,"This review is more about the service here than about the food because I'm still waiting for my steak to arrive and it's been more than a 20 minutes since we were finally given our cold appetizers. Probably a one off experience here but thought it worth sharing. We were initially moved to a different table after being seated for about five minutes so they could make space for a larger party. Then after orders were taken have been promptly forgotten by the wait staff, three other tables that arrived after us were served full meals while we weren't even given bread and now I guess they have forgotten about our meal because steaks still aren't here while other tables have been served! Frustrating!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Honest food at good value,-1,30,16-May-13,"We liked the food, french brasserie style, at a good price. It is not fancy or exquisite, but it is honest and comfortable"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Don't waste your money,-1,10,22-Mar-13,"My wife and I ate at L'entrecote recently, and quite honestly it was the worst food I've had in Singapore, and indeed possibly anywhere in recent memory. My wife ordered some foie gras terrine to start, and upon arrival noted that it was 'wet' - it certainly looked very unappealing to me. She was able to eat maybe two knifefuls on the toast, but had to give up after that. The texture was terrible and the foie had not been properly prepared at all.The only main dish available is the supposedly famous entrecote with the special sauce and frites. The meat simply didn't taste of anything resembling beef. It was absolutely dreadful quality meat. There isn't really anything else to say about that. The supposedly golden crisp frites were mass catering frozen chips that bore virtually no resemblence to the frites you might expect in Paris (or virtually any other city). The entire dish was totally unappealing and devoid of any decent flavour.The service was good and pleasant enough, and the wine was drinkable (just), but I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am familiar with the 'L'entrecote' concept from Paris and London, and it is good, but if you are only really serving one thing, you have to do it really well, and this restaurant fails in every respect on that front. Even their story about the origins of the concept on their web page is wrong."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing,-1,20,30-Oct-12,"Went for dinner anticipating a good meal. The appetisers, salad and desserts were up to their usual standards. The servers, whilst friendly enough, hurried us through our meal and attempted to clear plates even though we had clearly not finished. Couldn't understand what the rush was as the restaurant was not full. The meat was the great disappointment. It was a piece of mystery beef that looked and tasted more like a flank steak. Whilst it was well cooked, it was not what the restaurant advertises - an 'entrecote'. We had been to this restaurant many times before and were served the 'correct' cut but not this time. Disappointed."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Went there for dad's bday,-1,30,11-Oct-18,Food portion is satisfactory however their service so-so. I put under remarks for celebration but there isn't any free cake to show appreciation of us celebrating at their restaurant. (I guess they are used to serve ah mao then local)
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,An ok meal made worse by below average service,-1,30,13-Aug-18,"I gave Les Bouchons a few chances because I wanted to like it. Food has been ok overall but I wouldn't choose to go there again. The first time I went my partner and my steaks were significantly under cooked, second time my friends steak was so fatty he couldn't eat more than half of it, last time they were fine. I'd actually be ok with the food if it was decent service. I've heard great things about the Ann Siang outlet but this one is appalling. I can't say any of the times I've been I've had any of the waiters show the remotest interest in being there or even be remotely friendly. One time we were the only person in the restaurant and I had to go inside for every step to find the waiter who was playing games on their phone. He literally seated us and went inside and left us to go play games without even pouring water."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good portions ,-1,30,11-Jul-18,"Myself and my husband called in here last night for a steak and the portion was massive, front of house wasn’t the best felt like they didn’t need our custom but Tom he food was good and very big portion. I did ask for a medium steak but it was more rare for my liking. I would advise well done if you don’t like it dripping in blood "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sorry Les Bouchons,-1,20,25-Mar-18,Sorry my friends. You lost your magic. Once an excellent place for steaks in a nice atmosphere by the river. So what has changed ? Service ! Or lack of service. I was there on a weekday for a casual business dinner. Plenty of staff but we had to call for attention several times. Very inexperienced waiters. Good wine list with fair pricing (for Singapore standard) restaurant was 20% full when we visited. Please work on your training program and I’ll be back. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Regrets,-1,10,2-Mar-18,"Ordered the cote de beuf for 3 person but sharing for 2 they said no free flow of fries. Look at the price come on it was just fries, we were just tourist trying your food, we even ordered dessert don’t understand why we cannot have free flow of fries. Was served by a pleasant looking lady we had indoor and she was crying that I had to offer a tissue, guess it is really not a nice place there. That all I can say is employees first then they will treat your customers right. Overall we regretted dining there though the lady was nice."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,'French' restaurant at nice location on Singapore river.,-1,30,26-Feb-18,"Small 'french style' restaurant.
We loved the onion soup; the meat and french fries were OK.
But average service and a bit over priced."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Early Vday celebration ,-1,20,13-Feb-17,"Bit difficult to find due to surrounding renovation works. View all blocked and was brought to a horrible corner table (just because we were early). Anyway, our experience:- Bread rolls served cold. - Butter frozen. - Servers casually dressed, could do with better uniform.- Steaks were done nicely.- Frites look unappetising but tasted good.- Salad portion was nice. - Chardonnay's good. Would we visit again? Probably not. Ambience and warm hospitality were severely lacking for this $150 meal. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average,-1,30,23-May-16,"Food and service was average. Good value for the steak and frites. Selection was good. Service not so good, they seemed to be rushing us along."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Bad expierence,-1,10,15-May-16,"Came here with my partner and I asked to be sitted inside. The staff that served us wasn't very happy as she sitted us outside. We ordered for Grilled lamb and Sirlion steak but instead of received Grilled Lamb we got smth else instead, my partner was starving so he just ate it. The steak was good and worth the amount paid for which was about $40. Everything else was not worth the price at all. The red house wine was terrible. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Well priced Steaks,-1,30,21-Apr-16,"The steaks and fries were good, but service could have been better. Good place to go for a weekday craving"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Star of the show - Steak didnt quite measure upto standard,-1,20,12-Mar-16,"Went to this outlet since the one at Ann Siang was fully booked. It was a family dinner outing and other than the lovely setting overlooking the river, everything else turned out to be a damp squib. Service quality was very very basic, steak quality definitely very poor (The Ribeye was extremely stringy and the fat content too much). We had ordered for Medium rare and it wasnt done to perfection. Overall, it felt as if we were dining at a highway restaurant in the US. Value for money was also not very good. The housepour wine at 16++S$ was terrible."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Okay-Average,-1,30,28-Feb-16,"Had to send our steaks twice to the litchen because they kept bringing undercooked meat.
You would think a steak house would know what well-done means."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Perfect place to eat cold steak,-1,20,1-Feb-16,"Simple offering, poor execution. Les bouchons use to be a good option on Rob Quay but no longer. Staff don't care, they would not give you a table in a empty restaurant because they are fully booked (what you only use your table once per night?!!) and they can serve you cold meat without even being embarrassed."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Needs a major overhaul,-1,20,25-Jan-16,"No service for 15 minutes, no bread basket, burnt steak, light fittings and air con units that have seen better days, confused wait staff. We’re not on to a great start are we? Well, the concept of this restaurant is good – limited menu serving simple food, done well. In this case, steak frites is the star menu item but unfortunately the restaurant’s standards are slipping very fast. This was my first time sitting indoors here and before I even looked at the menu, I noticed that the once-impressive chandelier above my head, was missing several light bulbs. It looked dreadful! Directly in my line of sight was an aircon unit that looked dusty and mouldy, quite frankly disgusting! Why did I stay on? Well, because I’d been here before and the food had been good on those occasions, so I thought I’d ignore the cosmetic aspects of the restaurant and look forward to a nice steak. Had a hard time getting a waiter’s attention and it was 15 minutes before I even got a glass of water. No matter, we proceeded to order our food. We then noticed that all the tables around us got a bread basket, but not us. We ordered fillet steaks, one of the best cuts on the menu, and when mine arrived (ordered to be cooked ‘medium’), it was so burnt it left a nasty aftertaste! I requested this to be changed as it was unpalatable and as is usual in Singapore, the waiter had to “check with the manager” first. The manager / Maitre D’ was very courteous and helped to fix the situation immediately, no questions asked. The frites were a different story altogether – greasy, limp, with a few burnt bits scattered in for good measure. And the salad? If you like soggy leaves drizzled in so much vinegar it would make you wince, then come here. It’s like the kitchen staff have completely lost their passion for cooking – this was such a miserable experience. Perhaps it’s time for the management and staff to take a break, shut the doors and overhaul everything about this restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average food and wasteful portions !!,-1,20,23-Jan-16,"We have always been wanting to give this restaurant a shot and finally ended up here while talking a walk around the area. Service: nothing extraordinary.Food: average - definitely not worth the price. Most importantly, portions for the mains are just excessive and lead to a loads of wastage. Management should either rethink the portions or else inform the customers accordingly. We didn't find it worth at all. Better places in Robertson quay - you can give it a miss !!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Underwhelmed By The Food,-1,30,25-Dec-15,"Firstly I'd like to thank the manager Zach for being accommodating and giving us an indoor seat although the restaurant was fully booked on Christmas Eve. For the food, it's unfortunate that I was underwhelmed by it. Sirloin steak had too much fats in it, and the frites were limp. My salmon was too oily and I couldn't finish half of it. Our appetiser Os A Moelle (beef bone marrow) was extremely oily and it was a bit too heavy on the palette. Perhaps this is French cooking for you but for me, it wasn't the most pleasant eating experience. 2 mains with 1 appetiser came up to $115. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Visit for a drink by the river,-1,30,15-Dec-15,"The restaurant was ok and so was the service. I had the brochette of marinated lamb with salad and chips. It was passable, but nothing to rave about. Would not say this place is value for money. Love the look and the ambiance, the location by the river is lovely. Might be worth visiting for a nice drink by the river side."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointed with my steak,-1,30,13-Dec-15,"The starters and desserts were good but I was disappointed with my steak. It was tough and very fatty, which I didn't expect for supposedly the house best. The fries were delicious though."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Food quality has decreased significantly since our last visit,-1,10,13-Dec-15,"We had so much expectation from this place. However, food quality had dropped so much. We ordered cold cut and escargot as appetizers. Escargot was salty, fishy and oily. We ordered 1kg steak for 2 share. 1/3 of it was fats and bones that we couldn't eat! Our billed ended up to be $400. We will never come back! "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointing ,-1,10,14-Nov-15,"Poor service, due to poorly trained staff, our waiter couldn't remember who ordered what from the aperitif drinks to the deserts. We ordered a 150$ red wine bottle but they couldn't serve it in proper red wine glasses (we had some kind of enhanced water or white wine glasses instead). Salad was over vinegared and when finally the meat came, we were relieved because it was the only enchantment of our dinner, quickly spoiled as the staff told us that there will be no free flow of salad, while it was very clearly written on the menu (they called it a misunderstanding!) Last, avoid the brownie for desert, it had barely no chocolate taste, was served with a very average industrial vanilla ice cream, and was way over cooked. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good services,-1,30,24-Oct-15,Service was great but food was just average. After reading the reviews I was looking forward to try but turn out to be just
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not as good as expected,-1,30,20-Oct-15,"Heard and read reviews that the steak from this place was one of the best. However, I was a little disappointed as a birthday dinner turned out to be one of the most unforgettable experience. There was a fly or mosquito flying around inside the restaurant and service was bad.The steak is not too bad and the portion is huge but the salad and cold fries were disappointing."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Decent steak, but service could be faster",-1,30,4-Oct-15,"This was our second visit to the restaurant, and I must say that the first one was better. The service was good up to the point that we were seated, then we felt forgotten about. The French manager is wonderful, but the staff not so much. For some reason, we had fruit flies buzzing around our table. The first time we told a server, he just waled away looking confused. The French manager later brought a bottle of Febreeze (wonder how thats going to counter the flies), sprayed that around the table and left, apologising profusely. In the end, we got a table outside.The food takes a very long time to arrive. It's good for a lengthy meal, but if you want to have dinner in an hour and be out of there, this is not the place to be.The steaks are very value for money, and the wine selection is good for the price you pay, but the quality of the steaks isn't really the best. But what more could you expect for $40?We had the bone marrow to start with, and while it was buttery and delicious, it was a tad under seasoned. It needed a squeeze of lemon to cut through it's richness.Desserts were good, and one friend commented that he would come back just for dessert, not for the mains.Would we go back? Yes. Because you won't find more value for money steaks anywhere short of making them yourself. The restaurant looks more expensive than it is, which is always a plus in my book. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointing meal,-1,20,2-Sep-15,This was the third or fourth visit to the restaurant but unfortunately on this occasion we did not enjoy our meal due to the poor quality and toughness of the steak. We complained and were offered a complimentary dessert which we did not want. We asked for a reduction on the bill and were refused so ended up taking the steaks home for the dog who seemed to enjoy them. This was a special occasion with a visiting relative and was very disappointing. We will not go again.   
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steak, but nothing else",-1,30,3-Jul-15,"The steak is what they are famous for, and they can do that well and for a decent price ($38). However, the fries are below par, with perhaps only one slightly crispy chip out of 10. Entrées are average. Stay away from the house wine ($12), which is really not potable. Average service.There are more vibrant places in Singapore where you can have a good steak, and accompany that with decent entrées and wine."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disapointing to say the least,-1,10,14-May-15,"Our visit got off to a bad start when on arrival instead of a warm welcome we were told wait there I will check your booking. Service was poor the food worse. The staff made no attempt to be friendly or welcoming, they performed their work as if we were a necessary evil rather than a valued customer.My wife ordered Rib Eye medium to well, the meat arrived black on the outside cooked past well done, dry and tough. We passed this along to the waiter who in fairness offered to replace it but it took so long to attract the attention of the staff that my wife didn't wish to wait for another. There was no further attention from the staff other than to ask if we wanted more to drink.It was my first visit I certainly won't be visiting again. I prefer not to feel like an intruder. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Fantastic Frites, Fast Food Service Speed, Overall C+",-1,30,3-Mar-15,"Arrived on time for 7:30pm booking. We were acknowledged by the Maitre'd however he stated he would be back.A couple of mins later one of the waiting staff approached us to enquire if he could help. We stated we had a reservation for 7:30pm in the name given at the time of booking. He checked and confirmed our details and directed us to our table.Our waitress was pleasant, but seemed to be in a terrible rush.Having delivered menus were were asked shortly afterwards if we were ready to order. I know its a simple menu, but we had come out for a nice relaxing meal, not really what one has come to expect of Les Bouchon.We placed our order for main courses, we had already decided to skip the starters, and shortly afterwards the salads arrived along with cold bread rolls.This is something that both branches have continued to fail on for a good few years. Originally the rolls were served warm, now it appears one has to request them to be warmed once they have been delivered.Shortly afterwards the main courses arrived a. Both steaks were cooked as ordered, medium rare, and medium. I must compliment this branch on their frites - They are out of this world!!!! A lot better than the Ang Siang Hill branch where the fries always seem to have been cooked and are reheated under a grill which results in rock hard frites.From start to finish, including settling the bill, 57 mins!!'Finally someone has come up with a Fast Food version of Steak & Frites!!!!!!!!Overall, not the type of evening my wife and I were expecting.The frites were Tres Bon, but I doubt very much we will not be returning to this branch.Service - 7/10Service Speed - 11/10Frites 10/10 Ang Siang Hill Frites (4/10)"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Too pretentious for a bistrot,-1,10,10-Feb-15,"Hi everyone,  My friend who is living in Singapore was trying to book a table for my venue with my family but it seems to be a ""tourist trap!"" We asked a booking for 14peoples, they called me to inform that we have to pay minimum charges 150SGD which is around 100USD for a steak and fries???? Couldn't be serious? Even we take many bottles of red wine but seriously for 14 people it is a LOT! I am disappointed of the reaction of the owner. Is that not too greedy to take advantage of tourist in this way? There is a lot of restaurants in Singapore, we found a great one in Duxton Hill ""l'entrecote"" with charming chophouse in the area so we did our booking without any problem!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not existing anymore?? ,-1,10,6-Jan-15,Me and my fiance tried to find this restaurant for like half an hour and we could not find it. Probably they have closed down? we went to Vino Rosso instead and it was a good substitute.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Too much oil on my salad, the fries were spongy and the salmon didn't taste fresh",-1,30,15-Dec-14,"That about sums up my experience at Les Bouchons last Friday. While I was happy that they did not scrimp on the portion of the salmon, the fish didn't taste very fresh and it was quite oily when it was supposed to be grilled. Same with the salad that came with the dish. At least my husband enjoyed his steak which he said was pretty good and well prepared. Service was good and efficient. Located at Robertson Quay, the restaurant has a lovely view of the river that runs next to it. On Fridays, the area usually comes alive with people looking to welcome the weekend properly with good food and some drinks."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,what to say of a French Restaurant that fails French Fries,-1,30,12-Oct-14,"I little piece of beef, perfectly cooked served with burned, soft French fries and a good salad for S$44.The piece of beef was probably worth S$20. They are super proud of their homemade French Fries, but looks like no one knows how to make the best of it.No, I am not recommending this restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sorry - overcooked meat,-1,10,9-Oct-14,"Sorry - bad experience. I asked for a medium rare entrecote. The 400g entrecote was just overcooked - like a shoe - and the general manager claimed it was not. Very arrogant attitude, bad discussion, and bad overall experience. Don't go here if you appreciate a good piece of meet."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Inedibles at les bouchons ,-1,10,3-Mar-14,"I ordered lamb kebabs and friends ordered steaks. A friend (French) complained his steak was overdone and an Asian friend complained her steak was overdone but their steak was still edible as they asked for rare and they gave them medium. My lamb was over done as well, I asked for medium. Also The lamb kebabs had big nerves that made eating it unpleasant as can't chew on the nerves. All the fries served were brown and inedible. A total let down.. They have a French floor manager who is absolutely friendly and nice but he has to be tough with his kitchen to reject food that looks inedible if no one cares and customers feedback! Definitely a place where I am not sure if anyone takes pride in their work.. What a pity. It has a decent bistro feel. Don't attempt , not worth it. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak has to be good to be acceptable...,-1,30,19-May-13,"Unfortunately, it was not. I have tried the little sister in Club St a couple of times and that. Has been pretty good. Tried the special. Entrecôte from Normandy but it disappointed. It was big, way too big but had no taste. Taste is the most important thing with steak. Wine was good and good value. Starters were also pretty good. Great if you like people watching but be careful with your choice....."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,The nicer location but...,-1,30,3-Dec-12,"Les Bouchons' Restaurant at the River is in a nice location and the outside seating is just great (when it does not rain). Indoor lacks the ambiance of the Ann Siang location and is just too bright and without atmosphere. The food is similar, or is it just the ambiance that makes China Town the better steak? Good quality of meat and fries, a good selection of affordable french wines, but the service could be more attentive and is not that personal."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not quite what i expected,-1,20,14-Aug-12,"Went with friends for a birthday celebration, well, without the birthday cake thingy.It was my first visit, not knowing what to expect. But the reviews on this site says great stuff!The food was by far, just average. We have had better, but one certainly can't expect much for a S$46++ prime rib for 2! starters were below average, escargot had too much oil, the salads which came with the rib were full of mustards, fries were great as it was served hot. Skip the desert if you can, totally forgettable.Took about 30 mins for the main to arrive, we ordered 3 sets of prime ribs with various done-ness and an additional main to share, we were given fries enough to feed 10. We are well aware that the fries are free flow but the servers seemed to be conditioned in such a way that all accompanying fries need to be served with the mains, regardless if the table was overcrowded for more plates or for this case, baskets of fries. My point is, if the fries are free flow, come as when it is required, they do not need to arrive at the table with the main when there were more then enough fries. The servers do not seem to understand it, and they seem to be constantly under pressure, not sure why but they all look indifferent and definitely not too happy to be working there. They were amateurish at best, and didn't know what to recommend or even to caution if we have over ordered, which we did!The restaurant was full but i am not sure if it was just me, it was terribly hot and stuffy in their, definitely not a pleasant atmosphere. While the prime ribs looks pretty reasonable on the menu (S$48++ for 2 persons), the total bill didn't tell us that, it was close to S$600 for 6 persons. To be fair, other that the 3 prime ribs, we had king prawns (S$40++), a bottle of wine (S$105++), 2 coffees, a scoop of ice cream, escargots, caprese and creme brulee. OK, this was a case of us over ordering, just a note to self not to repeat it if i am to come back here, or try their better outlet on Club Street. (By the way, we came to Robertson Quay as Club Street was fully booked)Tip for those who wants to visit, the rib is big enough for 3 or even 4 if you are a small eater. The fries should be sufficient to let you walk out of the restaurant feeling full."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,BAD!!!!,-1,20,10-Aug-12,I used to go often when I first moved to Singapore and I slowly noticed how down the hill this place was going...hopefully one day it will get submerged by the river. A pity since the atmosphere is nice. I rather cook my own steak than eat here.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak frites with a nice ambience,-1,30,29-Apr-12,"The problem is, Les Bouchon is never consistent with its food EXCEPT for its fries... The fries were heavenly but the steaks were not always as good. Sometimes you are lucky and the steak is well done according to your request and most times, it's too rare to be medium or too well to be medium... The consistency for the steaks is just not there yet the highlights are the steaks....Too bad I love the fries a wee too much so thus restaurant is always in my mind... Probably the most expensive hand cut delicious fries in Singapore...Ooh, and the plus is that my favorite fries is free flow!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nasty,-1,10,21-Dec-11,"No longer as good as it was 5 years ago. Fries were burnt, steak was horrible. Stick to the club street branch!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Leaves a bad taste in the mouth ........,-1,10,19-Dec-09,"Dire. We've eaten at Les Bouchons in Club Street many times and always had great food and service. These standards are not emulated by the Rive Gauche restaurant in any way. After an hours wait I was served an American rib eye that was 75% fat and was clearly a very bad cut. Despite being summoned discreetly so as not to cause any embarrassment the waiter and management refused to accept that there was any problem and were extremely condescending and then became very rude. This was a simple issue about a bad cut of meat. It happens and it's just one of those things that restaurants know how to handle because mistakes do occasionally get made. It should be no big deal. Yet something that would have been so easily dealt with in any other restaurant was blown out of all proportion by two arrogant, small minded individuals who clearly need a refresher course on customer service. The attitude of the management is so staggeringly bad that Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is officially the worst restaurant I have been to, anywhere, ever. Vile, absolutely rotten."
French,Saveur,Disappointed after the hype,-1,20,6-Oct-18,"The duck confit, sea bass and aglio olio were all below average. The only food that stood out was the panna cotta"
French,Saveur,Understaffed and long wait,-1,20,24-Aug-18,"We waited at the entrance for quite a while despite reservations as there was only 1 staff in sight and she was keying in food orders with her back to us. Cannot serve wine on a public holiday eve as they only had 2 servers i.e. understaffed. The girl was new so she keeps forgetting her orders/instructions straight after our sentence finished. Through the long waiting time, we already saw 2 couples walking out. For $85, not worth the time and service, can get better somewhere else."

Frankly, if I had added starter, mains and dessert - the cost would have been at least $35, and that is the cost of a fabulous set lunch at some fancier French restaurants in town.

French,Saveur,Downhill,-1,20,15-Oct-17,"My 3rd visit since 3 years back, but that was in their Far East branch. Was a bit hard to get service, they weren't too attentive. Fair enough to say that it was Friday night and it was almost full house. 2 of our mains came much later than our friends. When it arrived the duck confit I had was not warm enough. My mash and mushroom were cold.. duck was not crispy. Sad. They were better in the beginning. Not coming back."
French,Saveur,No beef!,-1,20,10-Oct-17,"We brought my mum to Saveur for her birthday. 1. The person who called couldn't pronounce ""Saveur"" properly. 2. Our reservation was for 7pm or 7.30pm and there was no beef dishes left. We weren't dining late and i believe most people go for the absolutely delicious steak or beef Bourgogne. We were extremely disappointed. Thankfully the staff were very nice. "
French,Saveur,"So-so, below expectations",-1,30,8-Oct-17,Have eaten at other outlets so this outlet is really pale in comparison. Signature duck confit was cold and disappointing. Seabass was fishy and not fresh. Truffle fries was alright though.
French,Saveur,Hits 'n Misses,-1,30,5-Oct-17,"HitReally liked the duck. It was well cooked and went well with the sides.MissHowever, the pork was a sore miss that reminded me of baby mash.I'd return again for the duck and perhaps to try the dessert, but avoid the pork at all costs."
French,Saveur,Non-existent Service,-1,10,2-Oct-17,"We went to the Cathay branch of Saveur. Glasses of water were not served, appetizers came AFTER main courses, horribly difficult to get waiter attention. Food was average, but for 50 dollars I can definitely get a much better meal elsewhere. All in all, terrible service and food that isn't worth the price. I wonder what we even pay the service charge for. "
French,Saveur,Slow service,-1,30,1-Oct-17,Service was slow despite the restaurant was quiet. Requested for baby chair but the table was not set up. Have to remind the waitress on the request. Taste of food was not on par as compared to other branches. Have to make multiple request for the ice cream to be served and the server was probably having a bad day.
French,Saveur,Average I would say,-1,30,16-Sep-17,The food potion is small and i feel food are over price but overall experience is average. Nothing bad though..
French,Saveur,Food standard disappointing,-1,30,11-Sep-17,"The standard of saveur pasta has deteriorated while the mains have met expectations. We had the Pork belly, steak, sea bass and the duck confit. (Listed from best to worst). However, the ""star"" of the restaurant had to be the Caramel Lava Cake. It had no lava. we sent it back but the second one was not any better. The taste wise was also weird. Texture was not crumbly like a cake at all. more like a sticky huat kueh."
French,Saveur,Won't be Back,-1,10,4-Sep-17,"Am not sure whether you have disabled the review function on your page, here's my share of my experience at your Cathay branch:Made an appointment via Chope on Friday at 12noon. Sat on the seats right outside the place, staff walked around, saw us, took their time and didn't open up the place till almost 12.10pm.Ate few times previously at the Far East outlet (FE) and was really impressed with the food. So we ordered 2 x Signature Pasta, 2 x Duck Confit with add-on soup & drink for one of the Duck Confit. Checked with one of the tall built with pony tail waitress whether I can use my Chope voucher, and was advice to show it to the cashier during payment.Signature Pasta came in a jiffy, my kids loved it, soup came shortly, but it was mildly warm, I expected something slightly hotter, since I was the first table there and food should be freshly prepared ?? Thereafter, it took very long for the duck confit to be served, but based on my experience at the FE outlet, good things are worth waiting for. To my horror, when the dish arrived at our table, it was a far cry from what I've had in FE, to begin with, the food wasn't even luke warm! The duck wasn't like what I have tasted, the skin wasn't crispy and the meat was like something that was grilled earlier and quickly heated up prior to serving, the temperature of the dish really spoilt the entire dish. I can't believe I've waited so long to be served with food prepared insincerely.To make things worst, when I made payment, was told that Chope vouchers cannot be redeemed during PH, I admit that it may be my fault to have overlooked the fine prints when I bought the voucher, but why didn't the waitress highlight to me when I was placing my orders! Totally changed my perspective of Saveur, all the best to the management!"
French,Saveur,quite good and cheap food,-1,30,24-Aug-17,"quite good and cheap food in town. That said, most dishes are not available and it seems to be a recurring issue there"
French,Saveur,Ignore by staff,-1,20,21-Aug-17,"As usual when we reached the restaurant, we waited to be seated. At that time, the restaurant wasn't full house or crowded. Despite making eye contact with 2 staffs, we have been ignore totally. If staffs were busy, they could have given us hand signal and not ignoring customers standing at the door. As I have waited too long, in the end I had to approach one of the staff to tell her that I have made reservation and then taken to my seat. "
French,Saveur,Food standards have dropped,-1,30,15-Aug-17,"Used to love this place, not sure what has happened. Food was substandard. Sea Bass was not fresh and beef burgundy was watery and not seasoned well. Pork, Steak and Duck Confit was still good as was the hazelnut dessert but we used to find the food delectable and now it's just passable. Hope it was just an off day."
French,Saveur,Good food but used to be better,-1,30,6-Aug-17,"Have been a loyal customer of saveur and we ordered the usual favourites. However, portions seemed smaller and tasted a bit too salty. Overall still a decent exerience."
French,Saveur,"Duck Confit or ""counterfeit""?",-1,20,1-Aug-17,"Had lunch with my daughter on 31 July 2017. Mainly because I had a $20 Saveur voucher. Just as well I had the voucher because with just 2 entrees and 2 glasses of water (@30cents), the total bill came to $38.""Well that's affordable fine dining."" one might say, Sadly, the only reason it was affordable, was it was not very fine.While my daughter's chili crab & squid ink spaghetti was tasty, the portion was hardly sufficient for a decent working person's lunch.It was a good thing she was a genteel eater so we both finished at about the same time. If it had been me, it would have been gulped down in 5 mouthfuls.Now to my duck confit. An objective description would be ""The driest piece of duck's leg sitting on powdery mash, with a tablespoon of sauted mushrooms by the side."" I'd more aptly call it 'duck counterfeit'.Perhaps the ambience, or lack of it prompted us to defer ordering dessert until later. So rather than risking it, we decided to look for dessert elsewhere. This turned to be fortuitous because we happened upon a great cafe in Takashimaya - but that's another story.Suffice to say, my first (and, I think, last) visit to Saveur was a great disappointment. Affordable? Yes. Fine? far from it. Sufficient? {stomach still rumbling)."
French,Saveur,Food wasnt fresh and poor service,-1,10,31-Jul-17,"We ordered the dinner menu. Firstly the duck in the duck salad wasnt fresh and there's a strong aftertaste after chewing on the duck. The salmon confit was slightly more fresh but the freshness is nothing compared to a salmon sashimi that you can find in a jap restaurant. My wife ordered the seabass and it didnt help to lift our mood in the restaurant. The dessert was the best dish for the evening. But it didnt help that for each course, we were serve a minimum of 5mins apart from each other. The dessert was a good 15mins apart, with my wife ordering a lava cake and myself a chocolate hazelnut. We understand this is a casual restaurant, we dun expect unforgettable food but at least just have the dishes serve almost together and not after 1 person has finish then u serve the other. "
French,Saveur,Efficient and helpful service but food is mediocre,-1,30,23-Jul-17,"The lady who served us was most obliging when we requested some changes to a dish which we appreciated. But the quality of our mains was below average. The duck confit was a tiny dry piece of duck leg. The beouf bourguignon was chewy, the taste was forgetable. The duck salad was quite good but v small. It's not expensive but not worth the trip "
French,Saveur,Saveur the Cathay,-1,30,16-Jul-17,"They had a few new dishes. The duck confit burger (new dish) was alright, but the duck confit main was not as good as I remembered. Shame.
Seeing it was a Friday evening, we were surprised by the lack of crowd too.
Thank you."
French,Saveur,Messy evening,-1,30,15-Jul-17,The service staff seemed inexperienced and frazzled. Half of the time the orders were mixed up or forgotten (had to be prompted before food was served). Duck confeitt was good though! Atmosphere was relaxed
French,Saveur,Food standard dropped!!,-1,20,6-Jul-17,Went to visit Saveur at The Cathy few days back. Their signature pasta used to be one of the must order starter at Saveur but now the standard has dropped. The pasta taste blend and their duck confit was so salty. Overall quite disappointed with the food. 
French,Saveur,review of dining experience,-1,30,6-Jul-17,"Food was decent, not superb. Portion was really small to fill the stomach. ambience was normal......"
French,Saveur,Ordinarily restaurant,-1,30,25-Jun-17,Very crowded place which I am unable to understand why. Food was so so but service was not too bad. For the price I think it's reasonable although not fantastic
French,Saveur,"Honest staff, quick service and yet still good food",-1,30,18-Jun-17,"I went for last Friday lunch. The food is served 15 min after order. Quality of food is good. When we left, an honest staff ran out to return $2 note to us which he found on the floor. It was belonged to one of my colleagues there. Thanks for the honesty. "
French,Saveur,Worst of the saveurs,-1,20,13-Jun-17,I loved my food experience at another branch of saveur but this was nowhere near the same. The beef was dry and the pasta was average. The mocktail was tasteless. The server was new and didn't know anything when we asked her about recommendations.
French,Saveur,First time in Concetto by Saveur @ Cathay,-1,30,12-Jun-17,"This is the second time i tried Saveur but first time at Cathay outlet.
The food portion is rather small."
French,Saveur,Affordable Price,-1,30,4-Jun-17,Affordable price and acceptable food. Staffs are too busy handling the crowds pretty hard to get the attnetion of the staffs.
French,Saveur,Ok,-1,30,21-May-17,"1 starter and 1 main that we order were good. But the pasta squid ink is like chinese food, rather than Italian food."
French,Saveur,"Great taste, but Small Portions",-1,20,1-May-17,Got the chilli crab pasta - taste was great but the portion is so small and not even worth the promotional price. Pity as the taste was quite good.
French,Saveur,Good for families,-1,30,19-Apr-17,"The meats were done very well. The Duck confit and pork belly were crispy yet tender on the inside. However, I did not like the soft mushy stuff that the crispy pork sat on. The signature spaghetti appetiser was interesting and quite pleasing."
French,Saveur,Cody and Affordable,-1,30,16-Apr-17,"Had the 3 course lunch set on Good Friday that only cost around $23++, which is very worth considering the location of this place. Food was alright and decent, service is a bit slow though."
French,Saveur,Good food but I'm annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy,-1,30,14-Apr-17,Food was delicious and good value for money but I was annoyed by the inflexible Chope voucher redemption policy and so won't be patronizing again.
French,Saveur,food standard has dropped,-1,30,13-Apr-17,we ordered all mains and some side dishes and the pork belly sauce was simply bland and another main dosh (fish) was not fresh enough and has a fishy smell.
French,Saveur,Wallet friendly,-1,30,9-Apr-17,"The steak was really salty, so were the fries. The other mains that we ordered was the duck and it was okay."
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner,-1,30,7-Apr-17,"The food is so so which is below our expectation, as compared to previous experiences in other outlets."
French,Saveur,A bit disappointed,-1,30,5-Apr-17,Food quality has decreased from the first time we tried. Quite disappointed. Duck confit was not as good as before and that's what we came back for
French,Saveur,SaveUr money and time.,-1,10,1-Apr-17,Pretentious French food with poor service. Served next course with no regard for customer whether they have finished eating. Small tabless not meant for dinner plates.
French,Saveur,Reasonably Priced,-1,30,21-Mar-17,"I've dined at Saveur many times at different branches and I think an issue with it is inconsistency. The pork belly I had here was alright but the skin was hard to chew on (as opposed to crackling skin I had previously). One point I have to make is that though the food is very reasonably priced, the glass of wine I ordered was very little! It was definitely less than a standard serving!"
French,Saveur,Good Concept but Average Execution,-1,30,14-Mar-17,"The restaurant had ample space and a good place to hang out with friends and family. They were sensitive to customers' needs. Like calling us and informing us that they had only very limited food left because of an earlier event. Although It was only 7pm. All 4 of us ordered the ribeye steak (all medium rare). The steaks were medium and not as juicy and succulent as what we expected. However, I must say they actually do try to deliver reasonably priced food"
French,Saveur,Slow service,-1,10,12-Mar-17,"We got in at around 6:50pm on a Friday evening. We ordered our food quickly, before the crowd got in. We have got our main dish (duck confit) only around 7:20pm. In the meantime, the couple at the next table got in after us, got their main dish (duck confit and beef), and had almost finished eating by the time we got our food. We asked the waiting staff to check a few times, and each time they claimed that our food was being prepared.BTW, the chope voucher can only be used for a la carte items. Can't use for set menus."
French,Saveur,Disappointing...,-1,20,9-Mar-17,"Used to patroniseat their first Outlet at purvis street. Much as we had to queue for a long time, the wait was very well worth it.. menu has changed and the popular dishes were either removed or didn't taste as nice as before.. sorry last visit!"
French,Saveur,Food was not very tasty,-1,20,9-Mar-17,"Second time here because the first time round I misread the terms and conditions of the chope voucher and ordered the set meal. This time round, the service of the stuff wasn't very responsive or friendly. Didn't feel very welcome by one of the female waitresses. Food was pretty bland especially the sea bass that I had. Funny how the potatoes had more flavour. The pasta appitiser was the only thing worth the money out of everything I ate that day. "
French,Saveur,Poor service,-1,20,26-Feb-17,"Waited for an hour for my main course. Checked with the staffs 4 times, all staffs said that they had informed the kitchen. Spoke to the manager and realised that the kitchen missed out on our order. The food was served an hour fifteen minutes later. "
French,Saveur,Food was ok. But dont expect too much from service. ,-1,30,16-Feb-17,"Food was almost tasty, except for the duck confit that was a little too salty for me. The dessert was fantastic!!Service did not do justice to the good food offered. Serving staff don't quite want to do what they should. Appetizer only came right before dessert, despite several reminders. The staff just didnt bother to follow up. "
French,Saveur,Will not pay a second visit,-1,30,12-Feb-17,"The service was quite terrible during our visit. No one was trying to serve us until we ask for it. I personally walk to the counter to order food as the stuffs pretend not seeing me when I raise my hand. Plus, no one was trying to entertain us when we first step into the restaurant. Food quality was average and nothing to be impressed. Will not pay my second visit to this restaurant. "
French,Saveur,Attractive price,-1,30,12-Feb-17,Prices are pretty awesome for French cuisine. But we were not particularly wowed by the food quality. But I suppose u get what u pay for.
French,Saveur,Gathering,-1,30,10-Feb-17,"Decent and value for money French fare in downtown for all ; Friends get together , gathering in the week ."
French,Saveur,Only duck confit is worth it,-1,30,20-Jan-17,10% vouchers not usable with set meals. So the vouchers are not worth it. Duck confit is really good! But the rest are average only. Staff did not even inform us that plain water is 30 cents and assumed we all want it.
French,Saveur,Excellent service and reasonable fod,-1,30,20-Jan-17,"The overall layout and atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Loved the simplistic design and the open ceiling concept. The staff were friendly and service (including food serving speed) was good. Only let-down however was the quality of the duck confit which I ordered, the duck felt a bit dry and the mashed potato had a cheap taste to it."
French,Saveur,Not given a table sitting although there were free tables,-1,30,13-Jan-17,Came in 20 mins earlier than reservation timing for dinner at 730pm. There was a table clearly free for 7 people but were asked to come back at 730pm. Staff serving should be more flexible to serve the need of the customers.
French,Saveur,Standard has dropped,-1,30,11-Jan-17,"Used to frequent this place when it first opened. Food is still value for money however standard has dropped. Cooking of the food and taste has dropped from what I remembered it to be and so has the portions. Still a value for money meal, but not as great as what it used to be. "
French,Saveur,Food was great but overall experience not so impressive,-1,30,2-Jan-17,"The food was well presented and was delicious. However, seabass was a little too dry. Dessert was not served with cutlery."
French,Saveur,Restaurant was inflexible in stanchart credit card promo,-1,30,31-Dec-16,"Having been to Saveur since its beginnings as a stall in Tanjong Katong Coffeeshop, it has come a long way. however, the expansion seems to cause some quality of food, roots and values to be eroded. Other than the food whose quality somewhat is not comparable to the good old days, Staff were also incapable of being customer centric when dealing with the credit card promo, which really ended the dinner on a sour note for my friend who was footing the bill. Definitely higher standards are needed for this restaurant to stay its course. "
French,Saveur,Christmas Menu Not Up to Standard,-1,20,26-Dec-16,"Reserved a table for Christmas, as I enjoyed my previous experience at the restaurant. However, the recent visit was disappointing - chicken consomme was too bland, ""medium-rare"" beef was almost raw and the plate was full of blood with a charred sides & the lobster pasta tastes like your usual $3 hokkien mee. Their signature duck confit would have been a much better choice."
French,Saveur,Service,-1,30,26-Dec-16,Food serve was a lil slow. But overall ok. Atmosphere was ok a good place for gathering. Will still return.
French,Saveur,"Good food, not so good service",-1,30,19-Dec-16,"The food was good as usual, but the service, not so great. It felt like they didn't know what they were doing. 5 of us ordered set meals, but we only got 2 out of the 5 drinks and 1 out of the 4 desserts we ordered. Every time we asked for them, the staff would punch it into the system like it was an additional order before bringing it. Needless to say the bill was all wrong. Had to do the correction for them, the cashier had to print the bill 5 times before she got it right. "
French,Saveur,Average,-1,30,15-Dec-16,Supposed to be the place for cheap french food but prices have been creeping up. Suppose will be better topping up the extra to dine at a legit restaurant. Still tasty nonetheless
French,Saveur,"Main dish sold out very fast, truffle mash without truffle oil",-1,30,14-Dec-16,"Overall food is not so bad. We arrived at 7pm Sunday, most of the signature main dish were sold out. We were not told that the kitchen couldn't prepare truffles mash before we ordered it. After clarified with the staff, they mentioned that the waiter earlier may be not well trained due to she is a temp and offered to compensate to us. Since she apologised sincerely, we don't mind having back the same dish without refund. Even though our dining mood was not affected, I found that it's not nice to have twice disappointment for customers 1) most of main dish sold out, 2) wrong food served, which the management can look into it to improve."
French,Saveur,Underwhelming,-1,30,13-Dec-16,"Not sure if the general Saveur quality has dropped just this outlet. We had the Saveur pasta which was cold, and they ran out of a few items because of a problem with the truffle oil. This made the used-to-be amazing mash potatoes served with the duck confit disappointing. Got the milk & cookies dessert, which was a fun dessert but portion was just too small for $9.9. We also tried to use the Chope voucher, but I would not recommend it to anyone because it is just too restrictive, being invalid on public hols and the eve, and only valid for ala-carte items. They wouldnt even freaking top-up of $4.5 for the ILT and soup, and you can also forget about the daily promotions."
French,Saveur,Saveur at The Cathay,-1,20,13-Dec-16,Service was really bad and they charge for plain water at $0.30 per cup. Tried the duck confit -- good value for money but it looks like the restaurant was severely understaffed on a Thurs night.
French,Saveur,Saveur,-1,30,28-Nov-16,Dining at Saveur was average. Service still consider so-so. Truffle fries taste not strong enough. Price wise also average.
French,Saveur,"Acceptable quality of food, generous portions, but service need to be enhanced",-1,30,8-Nov-16,"Food is good, not fancy sort but tasty. Portions were ample. Great value of lunch set.
Service really need to be improved. Staff are not very attentive, and lack of service knowledge. No major complain but was just observing."
French,Saveur,Service could be better,-1,30,7-Nov-16,"Our reservation was 745PM, we reach the restaurant at around 715PM and request for an early check-in as we saw the table that was reserved for us available. We understand that our appointment time is not up and the restaurant reserve the right to let us in only when the reservation time is up. However the staff who attend to us is very rude in her reply. Regardless of what enquires we enquire, she gave us a very black face and only replied us that our reservation is at 745PM so we cannot sit in early. Hence we strongly feel that the respond and service provided by this female Filipino staff could be better, as if we did not remember wrongly, she is actually a managerial rank staff. Other than this, the overall dinning experience was pleasant."
French,Saveur,A Few Good Dishes But Disappointing Promotions,-1,20,3-Nov-16,"The mains and pasta we ordered are good but the sides of Truffel fries and soup are less impressive.The promotion basically give a feeling that the company want to give but don't want to give, For example, chope vouchers cannot be used with promotions (luckily we ask before purchasing the voucher), if get combo then can't get the promo price, promo only applies to lower price items which is the usual practice.Atmosphere is so so and almost like fastfood restaurant feel, waiters are not proactive.Feel that overall even though some of the food are good aren't worth the price."
French,Saveur,Reasonable for price but not fantastic,-1,30,29-Oct-16,"Good to get the choke vouchers if you are making a booking through chops, that lets you save $5 from $50. The food is reasonable for its price but don't except high end French food. The foie gras could have been better though! The taste was a bit strong at times, and it didn't really melt in your mouth. The sea bass was also a bit too salty and fishy. "
French,Saveur,Won't return again,-1,10,16-Oct-16,"I walk out feeling like I owe the restaurant something. Will never go again and won't recommend to anyone. Food though good, service standards are worse than a canteen!"
French,Saveur,SAVEUR PURVIS STREET is better,-1,30,3-Oct-16,"I've been to the SAVEUR PURVIS STREET before and enjoyed the quality dishes and nice service. But the service at the Cathay is quite disappointing. At first, when we were ordering a bottle of red wine, the waitress recommended us the 1 for 1 glass of wine, so we ordered 4 glasses of red and white wine. After serving 2 glasses of red and white wine, the same waitress came to apologized for that the promotion is no longer valid. Why didn't the waitress inform before serving? We were not able to change the order to a bottle of wine. After we finished the main courses, we kept looking at the waiters but none of them came to clean the table until my friend went to inform them that we were ready for desserts. One of the waiters even looked away when he noticed that we're looking at him. "
French,Saveur,Chope voucher is for a la cart food only,-1,30,1-Oct-16,I have bought chope vouchers for set meals and I have used chope vouchers for set meals at many other restaurants. However only Saveur made their own rules that it can be used for a la cart food only. Disappointed because this terms and conditions were not told or written.
French,Saveur,First time to Cathay outlet,-1,30,26-Sep-16,"The place is cosy. And the food standard is the same as Purvis and Far East. One of the server is quite attentive, when my friends finish their wine, she came over to serve them without us asking for any help."
French,Saveur,"Delicious, but Complacent to Allergies",-1,30,21-Sep-16,"My fiancée and I dined here on Sunday, 18 September. We had made a reservation so we were seated immediately and staff were quick enough to take our order. My other half and I decided to each have the 3-course set dinner menu: she ordered the foie gras starter, beef tenderloin and chocolate and hazlenut dessert, while I had salmon for starters and mains and the dessert entitled ""cookies & milk"". Unfortunately, none of these courses had any further descriptions save the names of the dishes on the page (no ingredients lists or allergy/dietary warnings; see the image attached). We were also not informed that the dishes were listed separately on other parts of the menu, something which is not always done in restaurants (it is not unusual for dishes to be designed specially for set menus).In any case, it transpired that the dessert I had ordered contained peanuts to which I am allergic, though only mildly. My fiancée had asked the waiter regarding the desserts whether they contained peanuts and he stated that they did not, only hazelnuts. I was surprised, however, that he did not investigate our enquiry any further than this, such as check with the chef.I subsequently had an allergic reaction to my dessert, but was able to recover without medical attention. When we brought up the lack of warnings with staff, they were nonplussed by events and simply asked us to direct our feedback to their generic enquiries email address which we promptly did (we have as yet received no reply).Overall, the food (as pictured) was very good, but the lack of customer care, certainly where something as serious as food allergy is concerned, left something to be desired."
French,Saveur,Set Lunch at Saveur,-1,30,19-Sep-16,Reasonable priced set lunch . but food taste abit salty then usual visit. Will be good if Saveur's can look into this and provide customer a healthier dining meal.
French,Saveur,Weekend lunch,-1,30,24-Aug-16,"Been to Saveur at Cathay. It is no longer called Concetto? We were a party of 3 with 2 set menus and ala carte orders and made a reservation through chope. Staff wasn't too attentive but it was probably because we were sitting at a corner?My friend had the mushroom soup but we both felt that it didn't turn out as expected. Other than the taste of mushroom at the end, there wasn't much taste of mushrooms. The mash potatoes on the duck confit was so sticky. Duck leg looks flatten into the mash. My medium rare steak was done to medium but it was great. Only problem is we were probably not use to the cheese in the herb butter. I was glad I tried a little of it before putting it on my steak. It was difficult to swallow and I wouldn't have eaten my steak if I put any on it. Dessert was the best. The consistency of the molten caramel that flowed out from the lava cake. It was just nice and not too sweet. The pistachio panna cotta had the taste of nutty pistachios. The creme brûlée has berries on it. However the moisture on the berries ruin the crisp of the sugar coating on top of the creme brûlée. It would have been better if the berries were not on top. It looked pretty though. I order a bottle of red wine and it was suppose to be 1-for-1. I had to bring it up before they bought me second bottle. Thank you for placing it in a bag and letting me bring that home even though the staff mentioned that promo was only valid if I drank it there. It didn't make sense for me to take up table space for another 2 hours just to open and finish another bottle of wine between me and my friend. "
French,Saveur,Very decent experience,-1,20,15-Aug-16,"- Were told to change table when we were having desert to give way to other customers, which is quite disruptive. As a result, me and my friend rush to finish up the desert and left the place.- Food taste was okay but the portion was rather small for a gu"
French,Saveur,What's the point of having good food when there is a bad service and poor attitude?,-1,10,25-Jul-16,"I was really hesitating to write this review. However, it is still kind of disturbing for me to recall this bad experience I had in Saveur Cathay. I was with my family that day and have made a restaurant reservation via Chope app. Upon arrival, we are served by this Philippino staff (looks like the restaurant supervisor, who is at the same time attending to the cashier). Initially, she served us with a smile and took our food and drink orders. We ordered only plain water (fyi, plain water costs 30 cents each). We have ordered 4 glasses of warm water and 1 glass of cold water. She repeated our orders as clear as crystal. However, moments later, she turned up to our table with the wrong order (it becomes 4 glasses of cold water and 1 glass of warm water). Instead of apologising for serving us the wrong order, she blamed me and insisted I was the one giving her the orders. I was so angry and pissed and at the same time, she did the roll-eye expression and she did not even apologise at all. Moreover, she just left the water and walked away.What kind of attitude is this, I was thinking. I tried to move on yet our food orders turned out to be wrong too. It was a total mixed up and luckily my hubby took the initiative and went up to clarify all our orders again with her. Imagine this??!?! What service is this when I am actually paying for the service charge?I cannot believe this... At the end of our dinner, when I was making the payment, she did not even bother to communicate to us and just handed us the total amount (where I have to manually offset the chope voucher myself with the bill) and just asked me ""CASH OR CREDIT"". Seriously, is this the way how Saveur survived through these years? Correct me if I am wrong... I did not remember Saveur to be like this, I had my many lunchs and dinners in Saveur (Bugis Purvis Street) and it was really one of my top most choices. Now.. after this bad experience, plus with my family members there, I will not go and visit anymore EVEN the food was good.I will also advise my friends to think twice about visiting Saveur.. I rate this establishment with a 3'D's.. Disappointed, Dismay, Discomfort & Definitely Disgusted!"
French,Saveur,Quick lunch,-1,30,16-Jul-16,"Come here for quick lunch and order their set lunch. Their signature pasta quite nice, main course that i order is chicken roulade with risoto (ok not bad). Dessert is the winner for me that is pistachio pannacota. Quite sweet but but nice or maybe because i like peanut.The ambience rather ok. As the service considered not bad."
French,Saveur,"Decent overall, but service staff could do with more training",-1,30,10-Jul-16,"Quality of food is good, but knowing that it's part of the Saveur group, we had expectations of better initiative from service staff, who obviously were either very inexperienced or part-timers. Otherwise, it was a rather delightful dinner (in spite of the squishy table arrangements)."
French,Saveur,Too long,-1,20,8-Jul-16,"Waited for food for quite long, the duck starter for the 3 set course is not nice. The kitchen is too loud."
French,Saveur,worst visit ever,-1,10,25-Jun-16,"Dont waste ur time and money go somewhere else. Service staff is snobbish, food is worst. Totally do not worth the amount been charge. Staff took super long to serve us and we have to keep chasing after our orders. Overall we spend and average of $50 pp and it is just horrible."
French,Saveur,Father's Day dinner,-1,30,20-Jun-16,"Had the angus beef Father's Day set. Beef was not cooked to right doneness (med well) and had to be sent back, came back still too bloody."
French,Saveur,another trip,-1,30,17-Jun-16,"the foie gras was not as crispy as it was supposed to be. duck confit was nice as usual. the beef tenderloin was superb. aft the meal i felt cheated tho as i wanted to choose my preferred seats but they said other seats were reserved, yet i also did make a reservation but was given some random seats. ironic isnt it. causes the experience to dim a little. not that i was being fussy on that day."
French,Saveur,Disappointed customer,-1,10,15-Jun-16,Service was slow. Waiter forgot the order. Waiters were looking down on the floor half of the time and not attentive. They even missed my special request for a cake for my mother for her birthday.
French,Saveur,Friday 20th May,-1,10,21-May-16,Meal was served wrongly. Duck confit was hard. Seabass tasteless. Full house on a Friday night yet they were severely understaffed. Wasn't as cheap as I heard it would be. It was almost $70 for 2 pax.
French,Saveur,French cuisine at the Cathay,-1,30,1-May-16,"Affordable French Cuisine at Cathay. We made reservation on line and was seated directly. Restaurant was crowded and seems not enough servers. Food are good. Try the variety of appetizer like salad, Foei Gras with apple and escargot, well prepared. We also tried the pistachio for dessert. Perfect choice. Can improve the service "
French,Saveur,Family dinner @saveur,-1,30,26-Apr-16,"Slow serving, had to wait for awhile for the food to be served. Food was consistently good among other outlets. Its just the waiting time and that the ventilation wasnt working very well"
French,Saveur,A rather disappointing experience,-1,30,25-Apr-16,Disorganized. Appetisers came after the main courses. Had a better experience at the Purvis Street branch
French,Saveur,"Food was great, service okay, waiting time EXTREMELY BAD",-1,20,16-Apr-16,"My friends and I ordered the 3 course dinner set. After the starter, we waited at least 40mins before our mains came. The dessert took 20mins after main course. We were just glad that we weren't rushing for a movie. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who isn't prepared to wait."
French,Saveur,Affordable French cuisine,-1,30,9-Apr-16,"The price is attractive but the portion is very small. Good place for gathering with friends and try out French food. Tried the Saveur pasta, duck confit, pork belly, and lava cake with ice cream which costs as much as our pork belly main course :) The duck is so so, but I like that it was not salty like some other French restaurants. The pork belly reminded us as Japanese ramen dish, and tasted similar too! But disappointed at the presentation, in a bowl, with gravy, like ramen without the noodles :) "
French,Saveur,Food taste good and affordable but service average,-1,30,9-Apr-16,"You don't get the welcome greetings nor look as you step in. We were there for snack but no sandwiches except mini mushroom soup and mini small pasta which both taste good. Soup served in a tea cup size. See my photo. But ice lemon tea was served super sour and I had to request for a change. Waitress said they made a mistake of 3 parts lemon and 1 part sugar instead. Oh well, if you are just passing by and it's not crowded. Hop in. But won't make a trip deliberately just to eat there."
French,Saveur,Average service,-1,30,31-Mar-16,"Service was very average. My plate was not cleared after we were done with the meal. For a good 20min. Staff were walking right past us and never once asked to take our plates away. Had to ask for them to clear it and bring out the dessert. The salted caramel lava cake is honestly one of the worst desserts I've ever had... The ""cake"" had a rubbery texture and the entire filling was salted caramel so the sweetness was just overwhelming. The duck confit was the only saving grace and that's the only reason why I'd ever consider going back...Disappointing experience. Been here twice before and this was the worst experience. "
French,Saveur,No coffee at Saveur during lunch hours,-1,30,31-Mar-16,"We were disappointed to be told that there wasn't any coffee left at 12.30pm on a week day. I was treating my friend to a farewell lunch and she had wanted a flat white but the server said (very nicely though) that they had run out of coffee, which is a little weird since it was only start of service. The irony: I much preferred the menu at Concetto before they became Saveur!"
French,Saveur,Small servings,-1,30,27-Mar-16,There was a party of 8 and it was our first visit.the food is average priced but in small portions.a few of us did not have enough from our own main entree.There was limited selection of beverages and desserts.This would be an alternative venue instead of a choice.
French,Saveur,average,-1,30,26-Mar-16,"i loved the relaxed atmosphere, the food was good, but each portion-size was different from person to person. service staff were attentive and polite, definitely a plus point."
French,Saveur,Experience soured by service,-1,30,25-Mar-16,"The food was excellent. Kudos to the chefs. Unfortunately the service staff could do with more training. Water not refilled, orders had to be repeated, 2 table settings for 3 pax. I lost count of the number of times my hand was raised to get their attention. Staff seemed more keen to interact amongst themselves than with customers. I'd only consider coming back to this outlet for the food."
French,Saveur,Atmosphere of shop,-1,30,19-Mar-16,The shop is big but looks so empty. The atmosphere not good compare to another outlet at Far East that I always visit.
French,Saveur,poor service from the restaurant manager,-1,20,7-Mar-16,"i need to wait the menu for 5 min after seated. no one notice that we cannot order because the absent of menu.
we need to wait another 15min for our pre-ordered dessert after we completed our main course."
French,Saveur,Poor quality of food and choices,-1,20,26-Feb-16,"Aside from the cozy ambience, food choices were very limited and poor in quality (food was cold for me). Place was also slightly filthy with ants crawling up my arms every once in a while and a dragonfly which came to visit whilst waiting for my meal to arrive."
French,Saveur,Feedback,-1,30,25-Feb-16,"The Saveur pasta was lacking in flavour, this was a tad disappointing as i remembered it as being very tasteful."
French,Saveur,Good food but iced/warm water is chargeable,-1,30,15-Feb-16,"Overall experience was good. Service was prompt and reservation was easily retrieved. However, menu was unclear of which dishes were not available.
There was no option of tap water and iced/warm water was chargeable at 30 cents per glass."
French,Saveur,Valentine's Day Dinner,-1,30,15-Feb-16,"Went to Saveur for its Valentine's Day set meal, we were seated promptly. The place was not too noisy as compared to the branch at Far East.We waited more than 30 mins for the appetizer to be served. I'm not sure if the waitress left us out or was too busy to keep track of our courses. She came to us and asked if our appetizers were served. Shouldn't they take note of customers' orders?Next, I bought a cake and left it under their care to be temporarily stored in their fridge. To my greatest surprise, my cake was served to the guests seated on our left side! I had to highlight to her that the cake belonged to me. She swiftly wanted to serve us the cake while we were still waiting for our main course to arrive and that spoilt the surprise I had for my fiance.Next, we were served ice water that was ordered by the guest seated on the left! Once again, I had to highlight that the order belonged to the next table. Are customers expected to help remember orders for the waitresses?Although I was disappointed in the service, I must say that the food were freshly prepared. I enjoyed the food there but would seriously think twice about returning. Hopefully the management can look into staff training."
French,Saveur,Alright experience,-1,30,17-Jan-16,We sat at a corner table that night and food came without a long wait but the ice water we asked for never came even after we finished the meal. And no service staff was around to help us! We were quite disappointed with the service 
French,Saveur,Ok.,-1,30,9-Jan-16,"Had high expectation for the duck confit but when I tried it, it didn't really ""wow"" me. Slightly understaffed but can be corrected easily."
French,Saveur,In-efficient,-1,30,23-Dec-15,"Ambient is good. Food is a 4, but service isn't initiative enough and orders were forgotten. Could be improved on that."
French,Saveur,Spartan environment concept. Ok food.,-1,30,19-Dec-15,"First and foremost, keeping the name ""Saveur"" does invoke certain perception on the quality of location, environment, service and food.I have not been to Saveur, but being one who usually researches and looks at reviews prior, I have been forewarned to lower my expectations and not compare it to Saveur.We were meeting a long time friend there for lunch, and reaching just before they opened. Spartan greyish plain environment setting, creating a feel of 80s canteen style, though this results in the chairs making too much high pitch sounds when it is movedService to the table was ""spartan"" - maybe just waking up to the start of the day. Not much of a smile.Taking the set lunch, overall I would say the food is average to quite good, though it is dependent on what is ordered and your taste for the food - likely the reason for reviews that stretches from very good, satisfying, to bad, rubbish etc.With my lowered expectations, I would say overall is average, with definitely room for improvement, especially in terms of service, food quality, and presentation. Perhaps a 2nd visit will likely result in a more realistic review. At this point, I would just say it is somewhere you can go to if in need."
French,Saveur,Decent value and food,-1,30,17-Nov-15,"Decent value and food, good location. Nice place for a chat.
Not much else to say, certainly not 40 characters."
French,Saveur,Better second time round,-1,30,30-Oct-15,Didn't have a good first experience here. So was a bit apprehensive when I was invited to a private lunch event here. My apprehension was unfounded as it was a good lunch. Food was tasty & service was good. Will probably try it a third time. Hopefully it will be even better.
French,Saveur,Terrible,-1,10,20-Sep-15,The most terrible mushroom soup I ever had. It was worse than the can. It was like water. The standards dropped drastically.
French,Saveur,Canteen food for restaurant pricing...,-1,20,22-Jun-15,"I think there are only few restaurants in the world which I gave this title, but actually it reflects the true concept. Someone doing canteen food and sell it for restaurant pricing. Will not recommend or re-visit this place again ever."
French,Saveur,Petite portions,-1,30,16-Jan-15,Not bad a place if you are after petite portions at the prices offered at a no frills place for a variety of gourmet food. Service is quick and polite. You can see the action in the open kitchen. Water is served at 30 cents. The 4 minced pork ravioli portion is yummy. Crab risotto was bland. Not a place to hang around after your meal if you want to have a quiet cosy chat. 
French,Saveur,Decent food for the price,-1,30,13-Dec-14,"They do dish up decent food for the price, especially in terms of presentation. The usual trade-off for the philosophy of good food at low prices is either quantity or quality. Concetto does well by its portions; however the quality is a little lacking for me.I tried the Grilled Octopus Caesar Salad, Buffalo Mozzarella, Beef Oyster Blade, and Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was amazing; everything else were subpar. I'm not expecting the world for their prices, but I do expect to have what I read on the menu. Concetto uses big words in their menu to mimic fine dining, but fail to deliver in the quality of their food.Good food does not need fancy ingredients. And with their Red Snapper I had a wonderful dish that used simple, fresh ingredients, combined with good cooking techniques. Stop playing with fancy names and instead use their culinary expertise to deliver delicious fine dining worthy food. I think that would make them really shine.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Concetto-by-Saveur/cmbz/F8F7B713-8333-4F47-A217-DF8074A26450"
French,Saveur,Don't waste your time at this terrible restaurant,-1,10,3-Nov-14,"The kitchen staff started taking off their aprons, which triggered us to follow up on our mains. We then saw them put on their aprons again and started cooking! When we asked the waiter if they had forgotten about our order and what turned us off is that he blatantly lied that the kitchen staff was very busy. Ya right. The food was a complete disappointment - the aglio tasted was soaked in oil and tasted salty, like everyone other dish that we ordered. The duck confit looked like a piece of overnight duck thrown into the microwave. This restaurant is a complete disaster and I totally regretted my visit into this nightmare restaurant wannabe. A far cry from Saveur, and a total disgrace. "
French,Saveur,Horrible Food and service!,-1,10,8-Oct-14,"Went to Concetto by Saveur thinking the standard is as good as its sister restaurant in Purvis street but I was totally WRONG! I had the seafood soup which was the only dish I think is quite good. For starter I had the saveur's signature pasta but compared to the restaurant at Purvis street this one was totally dry and tasteless! Next the Kurobuta pork cheek for my main course had this intense ""pork smell"" and it was so strong that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The duck confit which was ordered by my friend was also mediocre. The service was also below average I sat there for 15 mins waiting for friends to come and yet no service staff bother to ask if I needed a drink! Overall food and service suck!"
French,Saveur,Food was so-so,-1,30,2-Oct-14,"I headed to Concetto for dinner on a weekday night. Although I didn't have a reservation, a group of 2 can be seated pretty quickly. I tried the Tuna salad and the Duck Tortellini. This is my second time at Concetto but I still think that the food is only so-so and nothing to shout about. I think they're better with French food."
French,Saveur,Freshly made pasta,-1,30,4-Aug-14,"We happened to pass by and decided to pop in. Perhaps they were trying for a zen like place, with concrete benches and minimalist decor. The crowd was mostly in their 20s.Foodwise, we liked what we ordered. We started with the grilled octopus, with fennel leaves and lemon aioli. It was fresh and light. We also had the prawn aglio and the duck tortellini. The prawn pasta was good, with the right amount of spiciness and was not too oily. The tortellini was nice and not too firm, though I did think that some of the duck tasted a little strong and gamey. Overall, the dish was good.Portions are smallish, but prices were also reasonable. Service was friendly and quick.They also have a French bistro over at Far East, so do try that out too."
French,Saveur,Decent food at reasonable price,-1,30,10-Jun-14,"The menu is short and sweet.. there's a page of Pasta information, which is nice.. but what I don't understand why there is a choice of fresh and box pasta? Shouldn't you use fresh pasta all the time? if you're using box pasta, I think all of us can also make our own pasta dish at home. The dishes we ordered were bolognese and prawn aglio olio, both with fresh pasta. The bolognese was okay, I have had better, but the prawn aglio olio was delicious! I think it's an okay place if you're craving for some decent pasta.As for service, there's this one waitress who didn't smile at all.. There rest of them were quite friendly.. I would come back again to try other food there.."
French,Saveur,Unimpressive!!!,-1,10,31-May-14,"As much as we appreciate new trends in recipes and food presentation, we cannot lose track of the traditional ones.Some recipes just cannot be changed in the name of creativity.The spaghetti carbonara we had was atrociously un-Italian.What were they thinking?A version of Italian ""laksa""???Even the Bolignese tasted like a microwaveable TV dinner.Fresh ingredients please and keep it simple.Im sure freshly grated Parmiggiano Reggiano would be nice instead of pre- packed Kraft.And please inform your staff of the existence of pepperoncino a.k.a chilli flakes.This is plainly a fancy restaurant with sub-,standard food."
French,Saveur,fancy impression and it stops there,-1,30,25-May-14,"It looks modern and minimalist. It gives you the impression that this restaurant is laid back but fancy at the same time. But unfortunately, it stops there.You will be welcomed by a hi-tech seating reservation outside. It's a tablet wherein you have to leave your name and contact and it's suppose to give you a call when your table is ready. We decided to just stay nearby (a few steps outside the resto) but 20mins have passed and we're still waiting. We see people just walk-in and they got their seats immediately. We decided to talk to the guy manning the counter and he's at a lost on what to say and just told us to wait for 10 more mins. We're getting impatient but most of the restos in Cathay are packed so we decided to stay. Eventually, the call came and we we're seated.The menu is small and concise which is a good thing. You will not be overwhelmed with choices. The food is great. The portions/serving are neither here nor there. The service staff are a complete let down.Am I going back to this place? I really cannot decide but I'm inclined not to."
French,Saveur,A nice simple menu with delicious options,-1,30,3-Mar-14,Concetto opened up in the former Billy Bomber location at The Cathay. Went there last night for the first time and was pleased with our dinner. I was expecting the wait-staff to come by after serving the food to inquiry about our meals but they did not so that was disappointing. That will come once the front of house staff learns to pay attention to customers. My advice to anyone planning to eat there is to save room for dessert. We didn't and I regret that as the Tiramisu looked fabulous.
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing for lunch,-1,20,3-Jul-18,Shockingly slow service for the set menu. Inexplicable. The food was half decent provided you could wait an hour for it to arrive. Many better places....
French,L_Angelus,OK experience,-1,30,24-Jun-18,"Chose this place due to it's French atmosphere, which I find quite original. The rest was average, crowd started to build up after 8.30pm."
French,L_Angelus,"competitively priced lunch menu, food OK-lah",-1,30,7-Sep-17,"+ SGD 39 for a three course set lunch incl coffe in the CBD is a good, competitive offer. + restaurant is decorated bistro-style in a renovated shop house.+ service is friendly and attentive- cold cut starter plate: good variety, but why do I need to visi"
French,L_Angelus,Walk in dinner,-1,20,21-Aug-17,"First of all, the food was good but the service from the female petite manager was really below average. This is my first time having a meal in a local restaurant that i felt i was actually in a foreigner country. Is kind of disappointing that it happened in our own country and is not surprised that the manager is actually a Singapore citizen herself. She has an attitude problem and the best part is towards her own people."
French,L_Angelus,20th birthday,-1,20,27-Nov-16,"We went to l’Angelus to celebrate our son’s 20th birthday.I mentioned to a colleague of mine that we would be going there on November 26. He told me that he had been disappointed the last time he went there for dinner and he would be interested in getting my feedback.The starters were ok, 2 x escargots, 1 salad and 1 duck foie gras. Mind you, it is not very complicated. A good oven for the escargots and a good knife for the salad and for the foie gras.As a main course we ordered Chateaubriand, Bar and a Wagyu steak. The meat of the Chateaubriand was ok. We had to wait a few minutes for the gratin dauphinois. Needless to say that the meat was getting cold while waiting. When the gratin arrived, it came as a rectangular kind of a brick, coming straight from the deep freezer. Unfortunately, it did not stay long enough in the micro wave as the middle of it was still very cold.My daughter went for the beef. Again, a disappointment, the meat was chewy but the French fries were good. At least they were not cold and were served together with the meat.My wife took the bar. It could have been any fish as the taste was covered by the sauce. Not impressive at all.We did not take any dessert.One thing that was very disappointing was the service. No smiling faces. The service need to improve a lot, not friendly and not efficient. There were only 4 tables with customers.We had been there many times but last night was our last one."
French,L_Angelus,Business lunch ,-1,30,12-Nov-16,"Friday lunch and if this is always on the agenda.
Good French menu and awesome wine list at reasonable prices.
We both ordered steak frites with rib eye. It was good not great for once something was missing."
French,L_Angelus,Great food that is almost worth the wait,-1,30,5-Nov-16,"L'Angelus rightly has a great reputation for its excellent French food and is located in the lively Club Street. But our evening was undermined by snail-paced service. We started with the incredible mushroom soup, the fois gras and terrine, all served in a reasonable time. Then we had to wait well over an hour for our main courses. When they arrived, they were excellent: duck, beef and lamb. We complained about the wait and management assured us that this was unusual and because they were short-staffed, and offered us a complimentary drink. One of our party said that they had experienced something similar before, so I would definitely recommend the food but only if you have superhuman patience."
French,L_Angelus,Just ok,-1,30,11-Sep-16,"Ok place, seating outside, noisy with uk football from the bar next door, friendly service, food average really for such a long time established place. Much prefer Les Bouchons just next door. Same owner, just better."
French,L_Angelus,Expensive for average food,-1,30,16-Jul-16,"Yet another French style 'bistro'. The interior is nice and ""chic"" and typically French. They have quite and extensive menu and wine list. The food was good (but very expensive) and well presented. Service is average. Overall I would say its a decent restaurant but over-priced. It seems to be the norm in Singapore that a lot of restaurants that provide average food and service feel the need to over charge in order to somehow give the impression that they better than what they are. "
French,L_Angelus,Unsatisfying,-1,30,13-Feb-16,"For a French restaurant, nothing could be more insulting than to be told your experience was unsatisfying, but that's exactly how we finished this dinner feeling. Had to leave for airport at 9:30 so wanted a great ""last night"" meal and cancelled Morton's to go here instead. Wrong move. I'm an Francophile so know my French cuisine very well and whilst the menu is French classics in theory, it's sadly not in practice. As another reviewer noted ""not the French flavor"".Got there around 6:45 and instead of sitting us at a table and offering a Kir, sent us away with ""we don't open until 7:00pm"" so we found a bar across the road and duly waited. Bread was great, good start. Pan fried fois gras good, but the product speaks for itself. Onion soup reasonable, not the best, but not the worst, and as my husband makes a great one with home made veal stock, it's unfair to compare. Main course, tartare and onglet (blue) with french fries, that were not really French fries. Too thick. Tartare was OK, a standard tartare and expectations were met, but no ""wow"" factor. The onglet was off - it tasted and smelt odd. You begin to doubt yourself initially because after all, this is a good restaurant n'est pas? It was red, and looked OK, but there was this distinctive odor and taste. I gave my husband a mouthful, he said straight away, ""no, that's not right"". It was left. When they asked what was wrong I asked them to ask the Chef what he thought about the steak. They returned and said ""that's what a blue steak tastes like"". I've been eating my steak blue all my life, even before I lived in France, so I know what it should taste like. I love my food and eat absolutely everything, and could count on one hand food that I rejected. This was one of them.I wasn't offered the choice to order something else at the time, but noted it was not charged on the bill, which was appropriate. We had lava cake and creme caramel, both average. I was told this was run by a Frenchman, but he was nowhere to be seen front of house or in the kitchen on a Friday night. Wait staff were attentive, but Chinese chefs cooking French cuisine is akin to French chefs cooking chinese food. It simply won't taste authentic. Wine list is expensive, a carafe of wine whilst good is $60+"
French,L_Angelus,"Really disappointing, not worth the value...",-1,20,17-Jan-16,"Really disappointing by our dining experience at l Angelus. Poor food, not the French flavour. The Saint Jacques and calamar as a main was a pure joke, not well cooked, and ridiculously small. 50SGD for this dish is a real joke. No problem to pay more in Singapore but not for this. The creme brulee was just decent. The wine was nice... Will definitely not come again..."
French,L_Angelus,Expensive La ..! Disappointing ...,-1,30,30-Jul-15,"Heard a lot about that restaurant, so was looking forward to it. Let's set the service aside : the service was good. Friendly waiters and waitresses. The decor was good as well ..nice posters on the wall, high ceilings and good A/C. But the food and the prices were a major let down. 115 Sing dollars for the meal was poor value for escargots / snails and Tartare plus mediocre chateauneuf 2012 .. I was chocked by the wine list and prices...a Cote du Rhone Basic Guigal at 88 Sing is excessive. Simple average burgundies above 110 Sing ..are simply bad value. The snails were swimming in butter sauce - strange recipe - not what you get in France. Average Steak Tartare . All of It ..disappointing."
French,L_Angelus,Living on its reputation 2!,-1,30,30-Jul-15,"Yeap, i do agree with fraser115.I used to like the place but after my last visit, i say: never again!I think the same girl manager served us and yes, she does not accept any criticism!And the best is she called the boss....he is worse than her...no comments!"
French,L_Angelus,nice & cosy set-up,-1,30,22-Jul-15,"food is ok, we ordered chateaubriand doneness to ' A point ' as requested by my sister. good!
good selection of wine. Cosy ambience, we like it, unfortunately, service staff are not great."
French,L_Angelus,Living on its reputation!,-1,20,23-Mar-15,"No restaurant can afford to rest on its laurels and unfortunately, that is precisely what this one is doing. The restaurant occupies a position in the centre of Club Street that after 7pm at the weekend becomes one of the hippest areas of the city. When we entered this quaint French Bistro style restaurant we left our entire feel good factor on the pavement of Club Street as the restaurant was completely lacking in atmosphere. There was very little energy among the staff and it felt boring. The standard of cooking was mixed; the starters were good however both the Duck Confit and the Sausage Cassoulet were overcooked. I expected a melt-in-the-mouth duck confit with succulent meat encased in a crispy skin instead; I received overcooked dry and chewy duck - dreadful! After waiting fifteen minutes for our plates to be removed, the waitress came to top up our wine glasses and we had to ask for our table to be cleared. We said the food was overcooked but the waitress, whom we discovered was the manager, would not accept any criticism. We asked for the bill and when paying we were saying we were disappointed with both the food and the service. However, the worst service was yet to come as I had to ask the waitress (manager!) to stop clearing the table next to us when my husband was paying the bill and she was still talking to him - absolutely appalling service! The staff appears to have forgotten that they are actually there to serve the customer. Club Street has so much more to offer than this."
French,L_Angelus,Great quality food but lousy service,-1,30,26-Nov-14,"Had a wonderful meal at this restaurant however the service was absolutely lousy, and we were often waiting to be served.The waitress never smiled once, simply put the customer last and made no effort to build up a rapport so we did'nt feel welcomed whatsoever. It was clear that she did'nt want to be working there.I found the food to be over-priced however I'm not upto date with the prices within Singapore so be aware of that.There are certainly better restaurants on Club St with staff who actually want you in their restaurant, go elsewhere instead !"
French,L_Angelus,"Appalled, totally appalled",-1,10,26-Aug-14,"While I tried very hard to maintain my virtue, every single aspect of this restaurant was appalling and I could not help but to find myself in negative territory.As this was the first time I had returned to this restaurant in 6 years, perhaps it was naive of me to expect the standard was still upholding.The quality of food, presentation, staff's attention, menu, service standard, everything was absolutely disgusting. I requested my steak to be medium to well-done, and it came out raw in the middle with dripping blood.Plus the meat tasted weird. It wasn't a high quality meat.My shoe string fries looked like a jumbled up wire that didn't resemble anything of a potato, but soaked in greasy oil.The onion soup was disgusting. The french toast on top was already soggy and there was no flavor.The price of lunch wasn't whopping, but if we'd pay $80 a head for LUNCH, we'd at least expect our steak to be done properly as per request.Overall, there were staff hanging around, not particulary doing anything but gawking and glaring at my female client who was Asian in an extremely inappropriate, indecent manner.Entirely embarrassed that I even considered this restaurant to be the venue for my important lunch meeting. Never ever again, will I ever visit this restaurant."
French,L_Angelus,"bad service, food decent.",-1,20,21-Jul-14,"Went there last Sat for dinner. Had a really bad start with a waitress and owner. there was a bug on the menu, and we casually mentioned it to waitress. Her response was ""it's just a little bug"". For a restaurant, dont think that's acceptable. Owner came by, and was unapologetic. Said something like ""do you think that's an issue?"". Also, asked for an extra chair for some bags. Was turned down curtly by same waitress and without much attempt or sincerity. (the other waiters were great though)Finally, asked to change a waitress. Food was ok, but honestly will not recommend nor return. Perhaps it's because we're a table of locals, but we were definitely not accorded fair respect."
French,L_Angelus,Worst Service Ever,-1,10,11-May-14,"Worst service I've ever had in my life. Took us 2.5 hours to have dinner. Had to ask for drinks 3 times and go inside to bring out ourselves in the end.Owner was rude when asking we complained, saying write a letter to the ministry of manpower about the bad service.Food was average at best.Wouldn't go back if you paid me."
French,L_Angelus,What a joke...,-1,10,26-Apr-14,"We are French, leaving in Spore since 5 years. We've tried many French restaurants, L' Angelus has been the most disappointing ever. Given the prices, compare to Le Gavroche or Le Bistrot du Sommelier, our expectations were quite high.Service really bad, attitude was good but due to lack of people we had to keep asking for water, napkin, had to go ask directly at the counter inside if we could get some ice water etc.Fish tartare was ok, then we had cassoulet and duck confit (south west French dishes), come on guys!! charging 40+ for what we had, are you joking? The confit was poor, oily, meat was dry, the cassoulet was blend. Honestly? You must change your chef. Last but not least they did a mistake on the bill, we got the bill from another table... Much higher... Glad we've checked. So sorry to write such a bad review. To end on a positive note I must say the house wine was good. "
French,L_Angelus,Sadly It's gone downhill since we were last here,-1,30,31-Mar-14,We used to enjoy coming here when we lived in Singapore and so wanted to introduce a friend. We were slightly disappointed with the service. Apparently they are trying to find more staff but it does spoil the meal slightly as the point of going to a restaurant is partly they you want to be served ! They had only one bottle of the champagne we ordered and also only one bottle of the red wine we chose. Dinner was steaks as this is what we remembered them doing well and they were good. As we had expected. Desserts on the other hand were a big disappointment. We ordered crapes Suzette and were optimistic when we saw they would be prepared at the table... The crepes themselves were already cooked. They were just put in the pan and sauce was added.... They were heavy and doughy not light and crispy and all the sauce did was to turn them into a soggy doughy mess. Had I been told that these were shop bought pre made pancakes I certainly would not be surprised.
French,L_Angelus,Double check your bill!,-1,20,15-Mar-14,I used to love this place. Until this time when I checked my bill and realized they completely overcharged us for the wrong bottle and the wrong number of bottles of wine. The service was already appalling to start with and then when we pointed out the mistake we were treated even more rudely! Make sure you check your bills!!!!! They tried to overcharge us by sgd 100s of dollars!!
French,L_Angelus,Forgettable experience,-1,20,8-Feb-14,"I was at the restaurant with a friend for dinner. Food is decent. Forget about service. My expectations from such a high price setting restaurant comes with some service expectations. I was reasonably disappointed. My dining experience is served by a rude staff and other more decent service team. It dampens my dining experience totally. They have an uncanny ability to make one feel that it is through the sheer grace of the service team, one gets to have a french dining cuisine. Since I beg to differ, I will never come back again."
French,L_Angelus,Customer service????,-1,10,24-Jan-14,My first review ever ... Shocking rude staff that could care less about happy customers. Decent food but I won't be coming back.
French,L_Angelus,authentic french with fairly priced winelist,-1,30,3-Dec-13,"Good to see a restaurant that maintains the authentic French cusine instead of making the ""personal"" touch that is often seen in Singapore. Presentation of the food could improve and the service should need a bit of high-end restaurant training (they need to know what they are serving and the method of preparation when asked) but the taste was superb and the winelist impressive and faily priced. The location makes it a great place to start an evening out with french as it its right in the bar and club neighborhood."
French,L_Angelus,Pas Symapthetique.,-1,30,1-Dec-13,"It was my first time in L'Angelus for a couple of years,and it was disappointing.My previous memories of the restaurant had been happy ones but I thought the quality of the food had declined from what I remember.The evening began well-the decor is attractive,the greeting welcoming and the service attentive.The free taster of a fish mayonnaise was good.Our starters of pasta and of pate were bland,lacking in interest but not unpleasant.My main course of lamb was similarly bland and my companion's of duck confit was dry and uninteresting.The dessert we shared,a rum baba,was not to our liking at all,though maybe that was just our taste buds.The house wines we tried,a Cote du Rhone and a Bordeaux,were satisfactory.I think perhaps a problem with L'Angelus is that the menu is too large.The best restaurants in France have a small menu:I have even been in restaurants where there is no choice,you just get served what is available today,what has been bought fresh in the market that day.A menu this large pre-supposes that dishes are pre-prepared to a great degree,and thus lacking in freshness and usually originality."
French,L_Angelus,More of casual dining experience,-1,30,18-Nov-13,"It was my 1st time visiting L'Angelus, not quite high expectations but given the reviews i've read, was expecting something better.Deco is simple and it was fulled house on friday night so it was pretty noisy and the tables were pretty close to each other which has no privacy at all.Appetizer - started off with Escargots, this is kind of unique as it had a layer of crunchy bread with garlic butter on top of the escargots. It was nice but my friend and i felt it was too salty.Main - i had ribeye medium rare and the condiment was potato gratin, these 2 dishes were rather mediocre. My friend had lamb and she said nothing fantasticDesserts - Chocolate Lava cake, this was 1 of the best that i had. Have to give credits to the chef, the cake cast was thin and soft, taste and aroma of chocolate just made everything perfect. However, the crepes suzette was disappointment. It was dry and the pancakes were kind of thick, the presentation wasnt appetizing too.Overall - Would only go back for the chocolate lava cake. If your a couple looking for quiet, romantic place then this is not advisable."
French,L_Angelus,"I was disappointed, too",-1,30,18-Sep-13,"Like Matthew H., I, too, was disappointed. I didn’t have any expectations as the restaurant was selected by a client and I didn’t bother to look at reviews prior to going there. The ambiance is fine, though it was a little dark if that bothers anyone. I’m not sure I’d characterize the wait staff as indifferent but they certainly were not very attentive. Fortunately, we were sitting near the end of the bar and our waiter was regularly at the bar, so we were able to call him over when necessary. We ordered the duck foie gras for four (SGD $158) as a starter. It was excellent, though not as much as I’d expected for the price (two livers sliced at the table). I had the grilled tuna and the waiter asked if I wanted it pink. I answered in the affirmative but thought it a strange question given that in the U.S. one only gives cooking instructions if one doesn’t want it almost raw in the middle. If there was any pink when it arrived the room was too dim for me to see it. It was cooked well done and very, very chewy. For dessert I had the fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was small and impossible to tell if the strawberries really were fresh or frozen. Out of fairness, one of my companions had the veal and pronounced it excellent. Another companion had the roasted spring chicken and seemed equally impressed.I should also note that this restaurant isn't ranked as high on some other review sites."
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing,-1,30,5-May-13,"My expectations were high based on previous reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed.Firstly I didn't find the staff particularly welcoming. We were the first to arrive for dinner at 19:30, it was hard to get a smile. Secondly, the staff were discrete but slow and we had to ask to place our order and it felt like an eternity before our plates were removed.The menu is quite extensive but they didn't have what I wanted, crayfish. I settles for a grilled fish, which turned out to be nothing special and expensive at over 50$. My girlfriend had a bavette which she found extremely oily and hardly touched.The restaurant itself is pleasant and offers a quality environment. My experience was disappointing to say the least. I won't go back. "
French,L_Angelus,"The wrong place for a French ""Art of Life"" experience",-1,10,10-Feb-12,"A very basic interior design. We could have expected better French touch to beautify this nice shophouse in the heart of a historical street of Singapore. Very dim light, dark enough to hardly decipher the menu. Fortunately, the service was fine and courteous. The main issue was the food. The menu is very poor, proposing the same skinny shortlist of stereotype French food that several so called French Restaurants in Singapore serve at exorbitant price, under the pretext that French food is very special. Hundreds of other delicious French recipes are left aside, presumably because they are longer to prepare than heating the content of a mason jar in a microwave. The duck confit that we ordered was by far overcooked and stringy. The home made chips were dripping with oil, dark and hardened by overcooking. The bread of the onion soup was impossible to chew due to a cheese layer harder than a sole. We were not taken by the pricey wine. Only the chicken was nice. But it can’t justify the astronomic bill we had to foot. Not to mentioned that our successive remarks to the waiter on the cooking issues didn’t have any impact on him or on the management. We felt totally cheated and scandalized. French cooking can offer such inventive and diverse tastes at reasonable price. It is sad that some unscrupulous entrepreneur make their business on local attraction and ignorance for French cuisine. Don’t waste your time and money. There are some other reliable French restaurants in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Terrible service,-1,10,28-Jan-12,The food is pretty good but not for the price. The service is awful!
French,L_Angelus,Gone downhill,-1,20,21-Aug-11,I have lived in Singapore for over 10 years and have frequented this place a lot on the basis it was reliable - although never fantastic. We went with some friends and the food and service can only be described as very ordinary. I think this place has had its time and although the rude staff used to be a bit of a novelty........its now got tiresome. I have been there a lot but i would never go again.
French,L_Angelus,You can't have both the food and the service bad. Must choose one!,-1,10,17-Aug-11,"Both the service and the food are well below par.Service: what's the point of putting tables outside if you're not going to to station a waiter outside? I had to walk in to ask for our bill!Food: I've had better beef cuts at hooters! Super premium prices for cheap beef cuts, overpriced everything. Meat under cooked. (asked for medium rare, got a cow that talked back to me)Overall, no reason to go back there with so many great choices in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,"Rude, rude, rude...",-1,10,11-Nov-09,"... if you are looking for authentic Parisian service, this is the place to go... the wait staff all seem to wish they were somewhere else, and the manager (French) has that certain je ne sais quoi which let's you know you are only there out of his kindness and not because you are a customer..."
French,L_Angelus,Home-y is the word. A place to chill.,-1,30,6-Oct-08,Home-y is the word. A place to chill.
