Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Seafood!,positive,50,07/20/15,"Great Place a bit out of the center. Here they serve seafood from around the world, also Norwegian crabs :). This is one high end place with stiff prices. But really worth a visit. Here one should try their speisalitet Pepper crab and chilli crab. Prepare for a delicious taste experience. But that said, this is not for everyone's wallet."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Chow!,positive,50,10/22/11,"we liked their crabs , shrimps..everything!!! the staff were also helpful in keeping my son's birthday cake while we wearing still having dinner"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best pepper king crab ever!,positive,50,08/28/12,"Do you want to try to eat a huge crub? well this is the right place!1kg crab for few euros. We went there in 7 people. we ordered 5 king crab, 2 portions of prawns, 3 portions of oysters, wine, beers, dessert. In total we spent around 60€ each. Not cheap, but if we would have eat the same in europe the price would have been at least the double."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing sushi,positive,50,18-Oct-17,"Traveling regularly to Japan, it has always been difficult to find the same taste in Singapore.But this time, I have found it!What a fantastic omakase prepared by the whole team is sushi masters.It was like a short trip to Japan during a dinner. THE sushi place in Singapore"
French,L_Angelus,"Really disappointing, not worth the value...",negative,20,17-Jan-16,"Really disappointing by our dining experience at l Angelus. Poor food, not the French flavour. The Saint Jacques and calamar as a main was a pure joke, not well cooked, and ridiculously small. 50SGD for this dish is a real joke. No problem to pay more in Singapore but not for this. The creme brulee was just decent. The wine was nice... Will definitely not come again..."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very affordable and delicious dim sum,positive,40,09/13/11,"Nestled in the heart of the Chinatown district, Yum Cha offers a delectable array of authentic Chinese cuisine. During a short vacation, a friend who lives in Singapore highly recommended this place. Me and my friend's family went here for some dim sum feast and we were not disappointed. The dim sums were great and we enjoyed every bite of what we ordered. I especially loved their siew mai, che cheong fun and xiao long fun. Restaurant ambiance was acceptable and the staff were accommodating."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Worst food ever,negative,10,29-Jun-18,"If someone asks me what is worst in Singapore then the food in this restaurant is the only thing I can say.
After whole day travelling in Singapore and skipping the lunch, we thought to try our favorite South Indian dish, i.e Idly and Dosa....More"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good place for banquet style dining,positive,40,11/14/14,"It's always easy to be positive when someone else pays, which was the case for this visit. That said, we enjoyed our evening very much. We were a large group (9) in a private room. After the appetizers we moved on to chili crab which was delicious. The accompanying sauce was quite thick and tasty. The large prawns were really very good. We also had a chicken dish and fish, both of which were good. The small bowl of fried rice nicely completed the main part of the meal. Desert was presented in a small bowl placed on top of a larger bowl of green liquid with dry ice so that frosty vapors were pluming from around the mango custard. Quite well presented and fun.I understood that the cost was around S$100 per person including plenty of Tiger beers.Definitely worth a visit, even at one's own expense."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",can be fun,positive,40,14-Mar-12,Can be fun even if some of the soul in the food has departed after the last renovation a few years back. Still fun eating under the stars... and ignore the touts if you can.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian food in SG,positive,50,11-Apr-17,"This has to be certainly the best Indian food SG has to offer. Have been there a dozen times now, at both locations and you can never be disappointed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheaper Eats,positive,50,4-Aug-15,"Have dined at Hawker #19 on two separate Singapore trips & the food & service is always spot on! Their Chilli Crab is delicious, messy & affordable!
The nearby drinks stall is always great, super fast & reasonably priced!"
French,Saveur,"nice food, reasonable price",positive,40,25-Jul-17,"prices are quite reasonable and the food is pretty good
had the chilli crab pasta and the mushroom soup."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Best Idlis in Singapore,positive,40,26-Sep-16,"Murugan Idli is really has the best Idlis in Singapore.
Their Chutneys are really good, and the dosas are crispy.
To be honest, nearly everything on the menus is good, except the coffee.
However the customer service can be lacking at times, the staff tend...More"
French,Saveur,Good quality food at afforable prices,positive,50,21-Dec-16,"Enjoyed the food, good ambiance. We had the set lunch. I had the Saveur pasta, which is very yums. For main course, the famous duck confit and for dessert, they ran out of vanilla ice cream which was in the set, but they replaced with something even better, chocolate mousse with crushed nuts. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ok ,negative,30,10/4/2017,"Not a bad place if you want to enjoy Chinese seafood in Singapore . This place is very popular with tourists, locals and a favorite place to entertain business visitors to Singapore. Overrated.Pricey, but so is everything else in Singapore. There are many other places equally good if not better and cheaper."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really Remarkable - but very expensive,positive,50,16-Jul-13,"Having enjoyed Tetsuya in Sydney - we were very pleased to find Waku Ghin in Singapore. Although still a restaurant run by the same chef/owner, the overall experience was completely different. While we knew it was going to be expensive, especially with the matched wine course - we were very surprised when the bill arrived. We do not research the prices before picking a place - because we may financially talk ourselves out of a great experience. This was a very good experience, but the 1600USD for dinner for two with wine felt a little more than over the top. Each course was extraordinary, building flavors and textures at each pass. The chef we had was very engaging - but not overly involved in our experience - which i appreciated. We also did not engage in any way with the couple in our room. In hindsight, knowing what we paid - I am happy not to have shared the night with strangers - maybe I am anti-social - but this is truely a once in a very long while type of experience. I am surprised to read that the menu does not change much - our chef indicated that Tetsuya is in residence at least once a month for several days. If I were to repeat the meal and have the same meal - I would be very disappointed. The signature dishes (Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato) were incredible, as was the shaved kobe beef. Our timing was very good - as we were able to watch the early 9pm(ish) light show at MBS. I was surprised to be charged 10SIN for an expresso at the end - felt like being nickeled after spending 1.6 thousand...... I would not repeat - but would recommend to friends for a very special experience. There are many Michelin-star restaurants that are equal or better for much better value. I will though always return to Tetsuya in SYD - each and every trip."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Suffered severe food poisoning; no contact from the restaurant,negative,10,18-Aug-12,"I cannot recommend enough that you STAY AWAY from this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday dinner on a Saturday night. In the early hours of the morning after, he began feeling very ill and subsequently was terribly sick for 48 hours. He had to go to the doctor on Monday as we were worried about dehydration, he could keep nothing down. I alerted the restaurant to the problem on the Sunday morning. The only contact number goes through to a central revervation system with a voicemail recording. I left a polite message advising that one of their diners last night had developed food poisoning, and they would probably like to check with both their suppliers and kitchen staff to make sure no-one else suffered. I left my contact details and asked them to call me back. I wanted to know if anyone else was sick that evening. I wasn't even especially angry: food poisoning, while extremely unfortunate, can happen at the best of establishments with seafood and human error. By afternoon I still hadn't heard back from them and I left another polite message. I assumed the line wasn't staffed on a Sunday. I also sent an email as an extra precaution. By mid-morning Monday I'd still not heard back so called again. Again got the voicemail recording, left another message. Sent another email. On Wednesday, I got an email from the restaurant offering us a free dinner. What?! We didn't want or ask for a free dinner; in fact I will never go there again. All we wanted was for someone to care enough about the guest that they had charged over $1,000 and left vomiting for 2 days, having ruined his birthday celebration, to actually call and discuss the situation and make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. I find this absolutely deplorable. To this day I can't read anything about 'celebrity chef' Tetsuya without thinking what a bad person he must be; and what a culture he must be instilling in his staff and restaurants. This review is overdue, but I wasn't reviewing for Tripadvisor at the time it happened. I still want to warn people now. It's not the fact that my husband got food poisoning, as bad as that was; it's the fact that not one person at the restaurant had the courtesy, care, respect or basic professionalism to call for more details and information to hopefully prevent it from happening to any of their other patrons. Dine their at your peril."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome food,positive,40,29-Apr-17,I love their sashimi! It's fresh and tasty. And their grilled salmon is delicious Too! However it would be more awesome if their drinks is included in the buffet. Overall it's awesome!
French,L_Angelus,Exquisite and tasty French meal ,positive,50,20-Sep-15,"Went with friends on two separate occasions, love foie gras so thought to give this French restaurant a try despite previous reviews. Talking to the staff, they had very recently undergone a change in the kitchen. Incoming Chef Reynaldo recommended the presse foie gras to begin with, the balance of sweetness and the savouriness was perfect. For our main, 2 of us had the Chateaubriande steak (portion was filling for 2) which was served with the very tasty potato gratin is a must try, codfish with cream sauce, sea bass was very fresh and tasty. For desert, we had the dark chocolate lava cake and poached pear. Dark chocolate is good, poached pear had a creamy center which is a pleasant surprise. Overall, you will not be disappointed. Ask the friendly staff and manager jasmine for recommendations and they are always willing to help.Regarding the the lack of pictures, we finished the dishes so quickly cause they were so tasty. When we remembered, only dessert was left. Will definitely be back. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Above average food at affordable rates,positive,40,20-Apr-14,"Right opposite Mustafa, this place is far better than Saravana Bhavan.
Food quality is above average (komalas opposite ferrer park and kailash parbat are the best in little india in my view)
Hygene is just about ok
Ambience is above average
Staff are very very...More"
French,Saveur,Won't return again,negative,10,16-Oct-16,"I walk out feeling like I owe the restaurant something. Will never go again and won't recommend to anyone. Food though good, service standards are worse than a canteen!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,dinner on new year eve,negative,30,3-Jan-17,"tables were quite close but service were relatively good.
food was just average, steak and fries were served cold"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",meal at shin minori,negative,20,31-May-16,The tablet system in the restaurant is very poor. A few times the order we sent to the kitchen did not get registered. We had to keep ordering and spent a lot of time waiting. A waste of time. Will not go there again! Very disappointed
French,L_Angelus,Good French Cuisine,positive,50,15-Jul-13,"My French colleague took us here, and the food did not disappoint. The service was great and we couldn't fault it, with great ambience and an interesting menu. The Terrine de Foi Gras was superb, and I had Magret de Canard (Roasted French duck breast) which was excellent. Good wine list also and one of my colleagues had Scottish salmon cooked in paper wrapping which looked superb. As my French colleague said, the chef is French and it shows!"
French,L_Angelus,Best French meal in Singapore,positive,50,31-Mar-18,"Went for dinner to L”Angelus and came away in love with the ambiance, service, wine and lip smacking delicious food . When you enter through the doors you feel transported to a Parisian Cafe in Paris. The decor is very warm and inviting and David who runs the place immediately makes you feel at home. I had the pate as my starter, Dover sole as my main course and their warm chocolate lava cake ( the first one in Singapore apparently) all were beyond delicious. Even the butter they serve is awesome. I would def visit as there is a reason this restaurant which is the first French restaurant in Singapore is still in business and doing so well. "
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore","Excellent Buffet Dinner @ Riverwalk, Clarke Quay",positive,40,21-Apr-13,"I have been to this restaurant for a couple of times, one with my partner and the other with my colleagues and both the times we had an excellent buffet dinner. The food was tasty, ambience excellent and good choice of drinks making the dinner...More"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good and reasonable food,positive,40,3-Jun-17,"Location is very good, just opp. Mustafa Centre. It serves delicious food and at a reasonable price."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,poor food except peking duck,negative,20,05/31/15,"We went there for dinner and all the food we had was pretty poor, especially the dim sum and the flat rice pancakes, which were impossible to eat. We ordered some glazed beef and the taste wasn't bad but quite tough. The Peking duck was good, though pancakes had a different taste from others I've tried elsewhere. Service was quite annoying because the waiters kept coming every 2 seconds to pour more tea, even if we'd only taken a sip."
French,Paul,Food is good but service is poor. Expect to have to chase them to serve you.,negative,30,15-May-16,"The menu is quite good and similar to cafe styles found in Paris. Food itself is tasty and presented well. Great location and comfortable seating. However the service here is virtually non-existent, the staff seemed to have been trained not to make eye contact at all. They breeze past your table not seeming to notice you are trying hard to get someones attention. Getting the bill is a challenge, you literally need to stand and start leaving to spur anyone into action. Overpriced but not for the food or location just the service is really well below what you would expect for a premium location."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not too bad,positive,40,6/11/2017,"Decided to bring my colleague since it's her first time in Singapore for some dim sum. There was a short line and around a 15 minute waiting time before we were seated. Because we went on a Saturday, the buffet was sadly not available.My favourite was the dumpling with fish maw at the base. Because items are pushed around in trolleys, we mainly grabbed what ever looked good without knowing the names. The soup dumpling though was quite disappointing because it lacked flavour and the skin was really thick. Overall it wasn't too bad. Not the worst but not the best either."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food was great, service was quick. Satisfied",positive,40,30-May-16,The dining experience was great. Food was fantastic! The service was quite fast before it reaches 8 p.m. though it took close to an hour for me to get my refill of ice water :(
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",IDLI - healthiest breakfast from india,positive,40,5-Dec-17,Idli ( rice cake) is a popular breakfast choice throughout India. Rice cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body. Murugan...More
French,Saveur,Excellent customer service and slightly above average food.,positive,40,1-Jun-16,"The food was not the best, but slightly above average. Duck confit's a must try! Truffle mash was really tasty.
The customer service makes up for the moderate food though, keep it up!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore","Good food, nice place ....",positive,40,23-Nov-12,"A nice complete menu, consistently good quality, decent service ... clean and safe .... slightly on the expensive side ..."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Love the free flow fries!,positive,50,23-Aug-17,"This place is best for fries and steak. If you love your steak and fries, this is the place to go. They are very generous with the steak. You can always ask for top up for your fries whenever you are done. Good place for hangout with friends. Recommended to make reservations before heading down. "
French,Saveur,Affordable and satisfying,positive,40,14-Oct-15,Went to have a nice dinner but there is no seat available at the moment. Reserve a table and within 10 mins received a sms notification that a table is ready. Food is nice and quite affordable. Will be back again soon
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Try the BBQ stingray!,positive,40,5-Feb-14,A friend took us here for BBQ stingray. It came with a spicy sauce but was delicious. We rounded it out with fried rice and green vegetables. You'll be greeted upon entry by a hawker who will direct you to their stall tables but you can buy from anyone.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy French Bistro,positive,50,11-Jun-18,"We met friends at L'entrecote for an impromptu dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant was full and buzzing when we arrived and we were welcomed warmly by the staff which set the standard for the superb service we received all night.The steak and fries were delicious (with the offer of unlimited fries being particularly dangerous!), as was the red wine and the three desserts we tried. A complementary Kir on arrival was a lovely touch too. We will definitely be back!"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic,positive,40,29-May-18,This place is close to Mustafa ..and their USP is amazing chutney. Please don't forget to try Butter Uttapam and Idlis...Cheap prices but delicious options.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,positive,40,16-Aug-17,Brought my dad there for lunch and we both really enjoyed the freshness of the sashimi and overall food quality. Hope to see some little desserts included in the ala carte buffet to end off the meal. Dropped a star as i felt the tables were placed so close to each other that we were able to hear each other's conversations.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",overall food standard were good,positive,40,28-Sep-16,Sashimi served were very fresh and portion of servings maintained despite several repeated orders. Will definitely visit again
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Nice ambience, polite and friendly staff",positive,50,10-Mar-15,"went on a weekday, it was a nice and quiet place for a romantic dinner with my so. had the signature steak and fries and it was fantastic! service staff were polite and friendly. would wanna visit this place again!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",One-for-One Buffet Lunch,positive,40,5-Oct-16,"UOB card one-for-one deal. Service staff were prompt and friendly. ordered from tablet at table, some orders did not go through and had to key-in all over again. sat at tables near sushi bar and some areas were used as storage with boxes piled up, rather eyesore. food wise, buffet selection was quite wide with sashimi, sushi, teppanyaki, tempura, grilled fish, cooked food like rice, noodles, soup, salad and deep fried stuff. what i did not like was the sashimi wasn't slice uniformly, some were thicker. and there were only 3 items for selection under teppanyaki. ordered the beansprouts, cant recall what was the other 2 items."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner at shin minori,negative,30,17-Sep-16,"It would be great if desserts we're incorporated into the buffet.
Food is average for a buffet. My friend ordered the fried soft shell crab, small crabs were served at the table."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food and inexpensive, if done properly!!",positive,40,6-Nov-13,"We ate here twice as it was close to our hotel, just a short walk from Newton MRT station. The first night we were silly and let one of the stall holders show us to a table and pressure us into ordering way to much food as well as garlic tiger prawns which although absolutely amazing, almost doubled our bill!! The next night, after reading up on how to do it properly, we chose a table then went up to order dishes from various stalls. This way you get exactly what you want and know exactly how much you owe! A nice mix of tourists and locals eating, which is always a good sign! "
French,Saveur,Fine dining at an affordable price,positive,50,15-Dec-16,Food was very delicious! Service was alright but could be better. Would still come back for another meal!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Vegetarian North Indian Restaurant,positive,40,6-Feb-18,"We went for lunch to celebrate my grand daughter's birthday. Being 10 persons, they gave us a semi private dining room. Very good ambience. This is the largest 2 or 3 other smaller properties (all in Little India). Very helpful and courteous staff with good suggestions. They even took good care of the little one. They tasty snacks like dahi bhalla, papdi chat, bhel, samosa etc. Lunch items were ordered a-la-carte. Excellent tasty food. Vegetarian Sindhi specialities also available. Value for money."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,As expected,positive,40,24-Aug-17,"Very nice people, great steak and fries, good chocolate mousse.
This is a place that doesn't disappoint."
French,Paul,Crazy busy place,negative,30,4-Sep-18,The queue to enter the restaurant was horrendous. But it was worth it for the delicious tarts and Oakley flavoured lattes.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing,negative,20,30-Oct-12,"Went for dinner anticipating a good meal. The appetisers, salad and desserts were up to their usual standards. The servers, whilst friendly enough, hurried us through our meal and attempted to clear plates even though we had clearly not finished. Couldn't understand what the rush was as the restaurant was not full. The meat was the great disappointment. It was a piece of mystery beef that looked and tasted more like a flank steak. Whilst it was well cooked, it was not what the restaurant advertises - an 'entrecote'. We had been to this restaurant many times before and were served the 'correct' cut but not this time. Disappointed."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","""Easily the best idilis served in Singapore here""",negative,30,23-Jun-12,For a reasonably priced lunch or dinner this will be a good place to have a meal along with your young kids. Can't say the service is that great here though as the many staff members here speak very little English. Usually occupied by Indian...More
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing jap sashimi/sushi,positive,50,4-Sep-17,"Had the Omakase and the 9piece set for both of us.
Probably the best tuna sashimi i have eaten (i dare say even better than the ones we tried in Osaka at kurumon ichiba market!)
Ended with nice birthday surprise from the chefs!"
French,Saveur,Enjoyable dinner at Saveur,positive,40,23-Apr-17,"We went to enjoy Saveur's 6th Anniversary promotion but was told that we need to order 1 main a la carte meal in order to qualify for it (besides having a birthday girl). We chose to have the set dinners instead & the manager graciously gave us free drinks. Service was fast & efficient though the main course, their famous duck confit, took a little longer probably due to the large number of orders.The chocolate & hazelnut dessert was really good but we were all too full to finish it."
French,Saveur,Centrally located Good Value-for-Money food,positive,40,13-Dec-17,"Good menu choicen of starters & mains... need to add a few more choices for desserts though but what is lacking in choices in this department is made up for by the beautifully tasting Caramel lava cake. The duck confit, pork belly & the squid...More"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not bad but poor service,positive,40,09/25/12,"I tried the weekday tea buffet which was good value because you can order as much as you want. Food was pretty good, there were plenty of steamed and fried dumplings and other dishes you can order as well. Prices have increased from last time and they did take out some dishes (eg. sweet and sour pork) that used to be there before. Service is poor - almost all the waiters there speak mostly chinese and they give you attitude as and when they feel like it. Ordering from them is hard and requesting simple things like water can be a challenge. The waiters/waitresses there never smile and are impatient when taking orders or answering questions. Food that we ordered did take quite sometime to come so be prepared to wait if you don't want to fill up quickly on the fried dumplings they repeatedly serve you on a cart that they go around with. The century egg porridge was a big disappointment because there was about 1/4 century egg inside the porridge. We liked the desserts - mango pudding, egg tarts and red bean pancake. It can be very crowded and noisy, especially on weekends."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum on wheels,negative,20,05/28/18,The unique selling point is the dim sum trolleys which brought back nostalgic memories when I was a child in Hong Kong. But that’s about it. The food is pretty average. The place is a bit tattered. Staff not particularly responsive. Any novelty value wears off very quickly. 
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Buffet at Farrer Park,positive,40,15-May-15,"We had buffet lunch at their Farrer Park restaurant. The food was delicious and worth the money (S$16). When I informed the staff that Naan and Tandoori chicken were over, they immediately refilled both and brought a basket of rotis to our table. Overall, a...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Great Food,except the chaat!",positive,40,16-Jul-16,The food was quite awesome ! Didn't expect it to be that good when entered . Do try veg manchurian and chole bature. Chaat was a kinda disaster though. But except that the food was excellent.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker Gone Wrong,negative,10,22-Mar-12,"Where is the Newton Circus Hawker Center of yore? Where a bowl of the best Indian Mee Goreng was $1.80? A plate of over fried anything starts at SGD$ 22 for a small plate, and by local standards, that's more than extortion. It's so sad that that whole area has been gutted out and re-fitted - the old one epitomised what Singapore food fare had to offer and in its own unique setting. Sadly, that's all gone now and I hear the beautiful back and whites are also headed for the demolition derby. I bid a tearful adieu to an area that all Singaporeans have great memories of."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch,negative,30,22-Jan-17,"Good food in general. You place your order on a tablet. Some of the food ordered did not come. When I mentioned this to one of the waiters, he told me to simply place another order. I thus had to wait quite a bit. Some food came twice. When I pointed out that one of the dishes did not seem fresh, the waiter (who seemed senior) gave me a blank look and did not bother to apologise or replace it. I would still go back though."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,positive,40,7/12/2013,"Was there with my colleagues from all over the world (26 of us) last night. Service and food was good, but a bit pricey especially the drinks and beers. The seafood was freshRecommended dishes and my favourite were:-1. The steamed live prawn2. The steamed live spring water golden phoenix Fish in Sintang style3. Famous Black Pepper crab - crab was fresh, but i didnt like the strong pepper taste4. Fried you-tiao with fresh crab meat and minced live prawn5. Supreme roast chicken"
French,Saveur,Value for money,positive,50,9-Feb-18,"The prices of the food were reasonable, came in decent portions. Had the tiger prawn aglio olio and chillo crab pasta, both were delicious."
French,Saveur,Food standard disappointing,negative,30,11-Sep-17,"The standard of saveur pasta has deteriorated while the mains have met expectations. We had the Pork belly, steak, sea bass and the duck confit. (Listed from best to worst). However, the ""star"" of the restaurant had to be the Caramel Lava Cake. It had no lava. we sent it back but the second one was not any better. The taste wise was also weird. Texture was not crumbly like a cake at all. more like a sticky huat kueh."
French,Paul,Don't bother,negative,10,7-May-16,"As per other reviews, the service is so poor and to add insult to injury, on advising the staff that we'd been waiting for a long time with only one meal placed before us, they were rude! I noted that it took less than thirty seconds for the bill to come out. Will find an establishment that is happy about my custom next time. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Awesome,positive,50,2-Sep-17,The food was an amazing the mutton was cooked perfectly would love to come back here again with my family !!
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Mediocre,negative,30,10-Oct-15,We had an overcooked pomfret with sambal. Bleh! The prawns somewhat redeemed the experience. Nice choice of meat curries but the vegetable selection was lacking. Nice mango lassi.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Wine a Let Down,negative,30,8-Jan-18,"The food is great and of course who cannot resist those fries!!!! But the wine list is dismal and very over-priced. We couldn't drink the first bottle we order (it wasn't corked, it was just terrible), so we ordered a different bottle. Because it wasn't corked we were not looking for a refund, but I would have expected the staff to inquire why we were not drinking the first bottle and asking them to clear it and the four barely touched glasses. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicious,positive,50,9-Jul-18,"Phenomenal sushi prepared by well trained professionals in a wonderful setting. One of the best sushi restaurants I have ever visited.
Not cheap but a great place to go for a treat.
Will definitely visit again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty,positive,50,05/30/17,Extensive menu and delicious food. The crab is a must have both spicy and delicious. It also serves frogs legs. The only negative is that some of the dishes and even the drinks took some time to come. The staff is very friendly and quite helpful. And reasonable pricing.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Yum Cha,positive,40,2/6/2016,"Hidden away in China town this little treasure has great food, quick service. The venue ambiance is cheap but so is the bill. You won't need a mortgage to eat here and the food is great. Go and enjoy"
French,Saveur,Value For Money!,positive,40,23-Sep-14,Good location for great food at very affordable prices. Don't judge it by the exterior.I had the spring chicken dish with cognac cream sauce which was wonderful. It is amazingly easy to screw up chicken but my dish was succulent and tasty. Also paired it with a glass of acceptable white wine for $6 which was quite value for money. The food also came SWIFTLY which was a plus point!Seating was a little tight but was not too bad. Overall a good place for dinner! Would return when in town
French,Paul,Late Tea at Paul,negative,30,10-Sep-13,"It was like 5pm+ and we passed by here. I was attracted by Paul's beautiful cakes and pastries. We decided to have a cup of tea and few pieces of cakes here! The environment was great, very comfy and relaxing. I liked the raspberries tart we ordered. Freshly touch but not too sweet. C'est bon! Paul is def. one of the good places for afternoon tea and cake in Orchard areaCheersD"

French,Paul,Perfect for a quick and simple lunch!,positive,40,16-Nov-15,"At a break time of meeting, I went to Paul and bought a duck sandwich for lunch. I haven't tried this when I was in France and I was surprised for its good taste! A little bit sweat which differs with other tastes and the duck is very fresh."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Seafood,positive,40,13-Jan-17,"Visited for dinner one night after a recommendation from the hotel. Glad we went. There are a lot of vendors to choose from and a good choice of food.It is mainly seafood, but there are noodle dishes and chicken on offer. Have to recommend the grilled prawns, chilli crab, followed by an ice cold tiger.It isn't the cheapest food on offer in Singapore, but some of the freshest."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent selections,negative,30,1-Dec-16,"Decent selections but not cheap. Costs $80+ after GST. Had to pay for beverage too. Ordering was made easy with tablet but the tablet would restart when you've ordered a certain amount which can be irritating as you would relaunch the app and re order. Quantity was reasonable, small portions for an ala- carte buffet. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reasonable place ,positive,40,15-Nov-14,"If you are really hungry but dun want to spend so much money for Japanese, this is the place!

There are also a lot varieties there such as korean, western, malaq and many more. Moreover it is very cheap so it's a good place to go if you lose a bet and had to treat your friends."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Pathetic service,negative,10,22-May-16,"Wanted to enjoy a nice Sunday morning breakfast.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great lunch after our Sunday walk at Henderson Waves,positive,50,04/19/15,"Looking for great crabs to match your wine? Long Beach at Dempsey is super highly recommended...we ordered crabs that were prepared in 2 different ways. Most people would order the famous Chilli crabs with mantou(buns that are either steamed or fried), but what we ordered are crabs cooked in white pepper and the other one with salted egg...it is a ""must try""...we paired it with a great French white..Puligny-Montrachet...what perfect pair...another highlight is their unforgettable Crispy Duck paired with great red wine...it so crispy that you can also chew its bones..no exaggeration... I can go on and on and on...the best thing to do is just visit Long Beach at Dempsey especially when you have foreign guests. You'll never go wrong. Bon Appetite"

French,Paul,Slow service,negative,30,23-Sep-18,"Came here for a coffee with some friends. The place is simple and quiet.
The service was rather slow as we waited for a long before someone took our order. The drinks also took a long time to be served."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious dim sum,positive,40,2/6/2016,"Very crowded dim sum restaurant where they bring the food around with carts for you to choose your selections. You can also request things directly from the servers. Besides your traditional dim sum choices, they also have Singaporean Carrot Cake. (For those not in the know, this is not a dessert, nor does it contain carrots, that I could tell). Get a seat by the window to watch the hustle & bustle of Chinatown go by as you stuff yourself silly. Service was on the slower side, but allowed us time to enjoy a relaxed brunch."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food!,positive,50,17-May-17,"Loved the sashimi offered at the restaurant, but will not recommend any of their beef dishes. $39.90++ for a lunch buffet, worth it!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food - once you get over the hawkers,positive,40,21-May-12,"The very aggressive hawkers turned me off at first. But we learned that if you just wave them away (and don't make eye contact (difficult for a friendly country girl)) - they do leave you alone and let you make your choices. You sit at a table near the middle (remember your table number or leave someone there to wave at the hawker so they'll know where to deliver the food). I prefer to order AT each stand - to ensure I know the correct price. We went back a second night - because it was so convenient to where we were staying - and the food was really good, and we had no difficulty at all. The Black Carrot Cake is delicious (warning to the novice: no carrots; not cake). And I love the pointy chicken wings: I'm going to make them that way at home from now on. It was great watching the plates that the locals had delivered. Next time maybe we'll be more courageous."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori UE Square,positive,40,1-Sep-18,I prefer the Katong outlet where seating arrangements are more spaced out and staff are more friendly and accomodating.

Then told her is alright, I shall canel the order for two combination, just the soup and a bowl of rice.Soup came, but not rice, so ask the Manager, she said ok will bring. Waited for 10 mins my little girl almost finished the soup and rice not here, went to check with the Manager again she said sorry she forgotten.The company should send their staff for training for service and name of the parts of the DUCK.If I have a choice, this outlet is OUT of my dining list."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quick lunch & nothing special ... ,negative,30,05/31/16,"Heard so often there's London fat duck. Then, there's also 4 Seasons @ Capitol. At last, I am trying this London fat duck.Average is an understatement I must admit. The next rating is very good which honestly, it would be an overkill. Let's put it, it's GOOD.For the price I paid for today @ $26. It's overpriced for just a portion, with plain noodles n hot tea.I had an amazing portion in London @ four Seasons, same offering at a much lower price than Singapore. Furthermore, it was better.Let's put it this way. At $26. I won't be back for awhile.Duck 7/10Ambience : 6/10Service : 7/10"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Pathetic Indian food,negative,20,18-Apr-16,"Ananda Bhavan's claim to fame, from our experience and understanding is, its location - opposite Mustafa.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin - not that Great!,negative,30,8-Jun-14,"Was with a friend to celebrate her 40s birthday at Waku Ghin the food quality is very good, top notch and very fresh, we trully enjoyed every course of it till the end. However the Sommerlier's recommendation of each course of wine pairing is very bad taste! We told him at the start we don't want a lot of the drink but would like to taste the different pairing with each course, at the end the wine were too much and the birthday girl was feeling unwell. My feedback is ""food should make you feel good likewise for drink too"" you want to enjoy it and not feel sick after a meal. His comment was the drink amount is standardized, if it's it should be McD that is standardized ... for the price we have paid I expect customization. I enjoyed my last year experience with the Sommerlier at Andre he was personalized!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",I prefer Tetsuya's in Sydney,positive,40,18-Mar-17,"""They say better say nothing if you don't have something nice to say.""Well I would like to say that Waku Ghin was a lovely experience. In that the food and service were impeccable. My objection is with a few others things though. The food with matching wine was $700pp so that was what I thought we would be paying at the very most - I was wrong. We were asked if we wanted a pre dinner drink before being asked if we wanted the matching wine option - a bit naughty considering that my husband and I both ordered a glass of champagne (which I think we were charged close to $100 per glass). Secondly they offered a truffle dish in addition to what they had on the menu, that too was approximately $100. Finally there was an expectation for a tip to be given - not happy about that either. We ended up forking out $1,800 for 2 for one very special night out. It was good - but my advice would be if you are inclined spend that sort of money fly to Sydney and eat at his restaurant there. So much better in every which way imaginable. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The real thing,positive,50,01/19/12,"We lived in Singapore 35 years ago and Singapore Chilli Crab was an all-time favourite that has now traveled the globe. In recent years the dish has become overshadowed by the salt and pepper crab and other varieties but if you want to try the traditional masterpiece--this is the place to come. Ask for the Sri Lankan crab --about $58 Sing--and a serve of the steamed bread---that's all you'll need with a Tiger Beer--heaven!!!!!! The Dempsey Road location is 5 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road, so you don't have to venture out to the East Coast."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",As expected,positive,50,24-Dec-14,"Having had the opportunity to visit Tetsuya's Tetsuya's in Sydney twice I did not want to miss the chance to visit this Singapore location. I was not disappointed. Food was innovatively prepared, well tasting- and served. Service was attentive and well executed. Seating might not suit everybody. Nothing to complain about."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Very tasty south-indian food, cheap price",positive,50,6-Feb-17,"I come here for lunch once a month - it is always tasty as home-made food. I have tried few other dosai places in Little India, but they are not good as Murugan at all. And the price is 5$ for lunch (dosai and coffee)."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Visit for a drink by the river,negative,30,15-Dec-15,"The restaurant was ok and so was the service. I had the brochette of marinated lamb with salad and chips. It was passable, but nothing to rave about. Would not say this place is value for money. Love the look and the ambiance, the location by the river is lovely. Might be worth visiting for a nice drink by the river side."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),So good!!!!,positive,50,08/29/17,"We ate at this restaurant almost every night as it was perfect for jet lagged travelers. Quiet, nice menu with many choices. Excellent service. My husband uses crutches to walk and they were very helpful to us finding a seat with a place to store them. "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good food, value for money",positive,50,30-Dec-17,"Food was good and value for money as the fries was free flow. Only complain if any is the space between the tables was very small, no privacy between other tables"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood hawker buzz and more,positive,40,2-Jul-17,"Lots of choices mainly seafood prepared dozens of ways, with other usual hawker delights - satay, curries, kway teow, mee goreng, poh piah, duck noodle, oyster omelete and so much more. Reasonably priced given its a hawker center. Aside from the usual drink vendors, there's interesting beer on tap stall inside the triangle farthest from the two entry points. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but excellent vaule for lunch,positive,50,30-Aug-18,"Heard so much about this restaurant. Was invited there for lunch. It’s like walking into Japan. The decor was so authentic, so Japanese.Seated at the counter top which seats only 8 diners. So much to eat and the food was excellent. I was overblown by the freshness and the use of the chef’s sauce painted on the sashimi and sushi. The taste was mild and not over powering. The best dish was the humble tamago with tiny shrimps. The taste was so unique and great.Definitely recommended but mind the pocket."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly!",positive,50,04/29/14,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly! The 2 of us arrived without a reservation but was given a table for 90 minutes. Fair enough.. Food was amazing and worth the rushed experience :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall bad,negative,10,30-Dec-17,Food was not fresh resulting in us having the runs for 2 days. Service staff was not friendly and had a bit of black face when we asked to top up the drinks. Overall we didnt enjoy the food as much as before. Standard definitely dropped. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,positive,40,21-Jun-18,Wide variety of food! Service was good and the dishes came fast. Salmon sashimi is fresh and thick. The birthday deal was value for money.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Jun family trip,positive,40,7-Jun-17,"Been there 3 times in 3 days. Blessings for veggies in S're. Awesome staff and food. Pl try chat items, they are awesome.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic Chinese fare,positive,40,5/12/2016,This yum cha (dim sum) place is the best and most authentic I have been to in Singapore. While we were there there was only 1 other non Chinese in the restaurant which I think says a lot about the food because the Chinese really love to eat. My friend and I shared 9 dishes and 2 pots of tea for a total of S $69.Great value
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A north indian food experience in Singapore,positive,50,21-Jul-16,"Another place to visit in SG is Kailash Parbat for authentic North Indian food experience. The chole bhatures, the palak paneer and the jal jheera are items one must taste here for sure. Ideally located in Little India, spacious and a good experience overall"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),What you pay is what you get,positive,40,10/2/2016,"The restaurant is filled with authentically Chinese design and have an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands. The environment and ambiance is very cozy and homely too. Not to mention the staff as well, Christine, Sun Jing, Mun Fung and Terry very helpful and attentive towards the needs of guests despite of the restaurant being busy and full house during lunch hour. Keep up the good work!Credits to the chef, the food itself taste amazing especially the custard bun. I would say, what you pay is what you get.Recommend to try this restaurant."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touristy. Overpriced ,negative,30,12-Mar-17,The food is average. Prices are crazy high compared to other hawker centres. Nestled in the middle of expat hamlets and orchard road - it's a convenient hawker centre. Food is acceptable - similar to Lao pasat. Staff are not friendly.If you can I suggest chomp chomp or Adams road. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,negative,30,19-Jan-17,Quite value for money but some items get loss in process of ordering . Worst of all seated next to a family with 2 very disruptive kids
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not the same,negative,20,23-May-17,"Lovely area and attractive restaurant, steak quite good, sauce nothing like the original concept, fries dreadful, being presented with the bill without having to ask is great except when you haven't even been offered a look at the dessert menu."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very good dining experience but not up to expectations,negative,30,2-Dec-12,"The signature dish ""marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar"" is the only memorable dish in the set menu. The other dishes were excellent on the night of our visit, and used first-class ingredients (Alaskan king crab; Tasmanian abalone; lobster; Japanese, not Australian, wagyu steak; etc), but NONE was sublime, the way they should be in a restaurant of this calibre.Great efforts were undertaken to make the experience personal: one chef in charge of each small-ish tepan room; high ratio of waiters to guests; personalised menu. However, the generally excellent service was not without glitches: my companion's glass of still water was refilled with fizzy water, and they charged S$20++ per person for water! I was presented with the credit card and credit card slip of another guest!!!So, overall, an excellent dining experience. But, at US$500 per person (if you have one of the cheapest wines or sakes on the menu, and including service and taxes), it should have been more amazing."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food,positive,50,7-Jun-15,"They offer a lunch special for $20.95++ which is a starter, main course and a soft drink. I had the walnut salad and the steak and it was delicious.
I would certainly go back again."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable Japanese buffet,positive,40,29-Mar-17,"for about sgd40 per pax, the selection of food is considered extensive. The quality of the sashimi is decent, especially the swordfish, and the skewers are pretty good too."
French,Paul,When all you need is some good scrambled eggs . . .,positive,50,29-Oct-14,"As the title said, sometimes you just need to have some scrambled eggs on toast, Paul offers this every time, good service and excellent quality food. A simple choice of venue that always delivers."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mumbai Street Food in Singapore,positive,50,31-Jul-16,Delicious food well known for their Chaats that are so tasty and come with so many different fillings. Highly recommended
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Average place. Decent food, not mindblowing but service was horrible.",negative,30,7/7/2016,"Being a fan of roast duck, I just had to try this new place out. There was a queue even though I decided to have an early dinner at around 5.30pm. Waited for around 30 minutes or so before we were shown to our table.We ordered the combination platter for 3 people, which was made up of some roast duck, roasted pork belly and char siew. We also ordered a plate of dumpling noodles and carrot cake.The roasted combination platter, although they said was for 3, was miserably small. The duck we were given was made up of mostly ribs. We should have tried ordering half a duck or something, which would give us a more well rounded taste of the bird. There was nothing spectacular about the duck I must say. The char siew on the other hand was pretty good! It had a nice smokiness about it with the flavors lingering in the mouth. Quite well done for local standards. The roasted pork belly was the best of the 3 meats. The meat was not too salty and the skin was beautifully crispy. It went perfectly well with the horseradish sauce. If I had to deduct points, I would deduct it for being too small a portion.The carrot cake was quite well done, it had nice chunks of white raddish embedded in it and the overall flavor was just nice. It wasn't overly greasy and went very well with the chilli sauce.The dumpling noodles were pretty average, nice fat dumplings but the portions were incredibly small. Thankfully that order was meant for a 4 year old who finished it quite easily. The service however, just like in most local places, leaves much to be desired. When we were nearly done with our meal, and I do mean nearly done, the waiters were overly enthusiastic about cleaning the table and started taking away the empty bowls and plates and some of the cutlery......leaving me to wonder how was I to finish off that last piece of carrot cake on the table. My daughter, who took a ""break"" during dinner to use the toilet, nearly had her bowl of noodles taken away as well and we had to tell the waiter that we weren't done a few times while his hands went all over the table. I can understand the rush but they missed out on us ordering desserts."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food but nothing to shout about,negative,30,26-Aug-12,"This place was great 15 years ago but today, it is just another hawker centre. With so many newer food courts in town and in almost all shopping malls, Newton Hawker Centre has lost its appeal. Today it is spacious and fairly clean, with lots of seating and parking available. But I agree with the other reviewers that there is not a lot of choice as every hawker seems to be offering the same dishes. If you're in the area and need a meal, by all means visit Newton Hawker Centre. But it is not worth going out of your way to have a meal there. Just make sure you check on the price of the dish you want to order first to avoid problems later on."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Again a great meal,positive,40,7/9/2016,"Second visit and didn't disappoint, great yum cha food with a good variety and quick service, fun and full of atmosphere."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",After a long time ,negative,30,18-Jul-17,I bought a take away paper Dosa with masala on the side.

Unfortunately the staff was very busy during the lunch buffet and did not manage to attend to us calling them for help. It took a while for the staff to respond. Otherwise, the food was of reasonable quality for the price paid and it had a good ambience as well. Will consider returning to this place."

French,Saveur,Poor quality of food and choices,negative,20,26-Feb-16,"Aside from the cozy ambience, food choices were very limited and poor in quality (food was cold for me). Place was also slightly filthy with ants crawling up my arms every once in a while and a dragonfly which came to visit whilst waiting for my meal to arrive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Was slight disappointed,negative,30,16-Jun-17,"Went there with friends for a birthday celebration, had high expectations as we read some good reviews and it was our first time there. The food was average, some of the sashimi were cut into uneven thickness, the fish also wasn't very fresh. The service was slow but understandable as the place was filled. Price is abit steep for the quality of service and food that was provided."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty Average Food,negative,30,2-May-17,"Went there with great expectations after seeing the place win some awards on reservation sites, went away feeling underwhelmed.Many of the dishes tried were average at best, and lack even the closeness to japanese food flavours one can regularly find at places like Keyaki, or even at Chako and Hakata (previously at Hong Leong Gardens).For eg. Chicken teppan came pretty hard to chew and had a gooey sweet taste to it, which was quite odd; Ebi tempura came rather limp and bland while the accompanying dip was tasteless, unlike the very light but aromatic dip, one usually would expect. Gyuniku Shogayaki was good, though the flavour resembles more a cze char dish than a japanese itamemonoThe sashimi were good, clean and fresh tasting, so are the sushi and temaki. Well-made, standard fares, so those would be the standouts in the restaurant.Entertainer app can be used for PH eve, however some of the staff were unaware of this, but eventually the correct processing was done, so customer may need to be more in tune with the promotions on offer instead of relying only on the service crew.Pretty packed on a noisy Saturday afternoon, so no ambience to speak of.For the sheer variety, the price is very decent at $40++"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A little pricey but awesome taste,positive,50,2-Nov-16,"Great chaat items and snacks. Loved the tea! Was missing India and this was the perfect evening sipping tea after a long tiring day! Very nice staff, accommodating and helpful!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's an institution ??,negative,30,10-Nov-16,"Newton Hawker Centre has become a must visit on the tourist check list. I've been visiting for the past 35 years. The food is varied and affordable. But like most street food it's invariably acceptable quality. The centre is open well past midnight so it's a popular late night option. Local favourites include oyster omelet, sate, chicken rice and a wide variety of sea food.It's prudent to check what the ordered items will cost while ordering "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Art of Sushi,positive,50,11-Jul-13,"I like to think of myself as well versed in Sushi but by no means an expert. My experience at Shinji Raffles was not only a culinary masterpiece but an educational one as well. On short notice I was able to secure a booking for lunch at the sushi bar. We were greeted warmly at the door and were seated promptly at the Sushi Bar which was around 75% full. My plan was to go with the Omakase and so with a quick glance at the menu and a consult with my dining companion we proceeded down this path. I won't bore you with too many details but to say that I proceeded to partake of some of the freshest and most artfully prepared sushi would be an appropriate statement. Of course what makes the experience so special is the Sushi Chef. Basically at the sushi bar you have one Sushi Chef taking care of no more than 2 or 3 couples at most. Don't know if it is because we ordered the Omakase but our Chef Kobayashi San was taking care of us only and just doing some support work for some other chefs. After the starting off with Sashimi, and then some cooked items, there was then a parade of Nigiri sushi prepared for us and they were eaten one by one with our hands as recommended by Kobayashi San. This excellent meal was topped of by a delicious hand roll and some exotic Okinawa Pineapple that was incredibly sweet and delicious. Each item presented to us was explained in detail by our chef which made the experience as educational as it was delicious. As noted in many reviews all of the chefs are from Japan and all of the fish and even the vegetables and fruits that we enjoyed were all from Japan. Kobayashi San advised that they have 4 air freight shipments a week. They literally have brought the best of Japan to SIngapore. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and experience to anyone who truly appreciates quality Sushi. This is not an inexpensive meal, in fact to date it is the most expensive sushi meal that I have had but I have no regrets as I feel the quality and the service warrant the price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great especially for celebration of special events,positive,50,23-Apr-18,"We recently celebrated our daughter's 21st birthday here a few weeks ago. We had a private room to ourselves and Chef was very good in explaining ingredients used and style of cooking. We have been to Waku Ghin a few times and they have never disappointed. They have a few regular dishes including their specialty dish, which is always superb. Thouroughly enjoyed this birthday celebration dinner. Thanks for taking care of us."
French,L_Angelus,One of my favorite French restaurants!,positive,40,19-Aug-18,"I have been a couple of times to this restaurant and I was happy with their food every time. Food was tasty and quite generous portion, specially cheese. There was a good selection of wine and reasonable price. Staff were polite and attentive. It was quite relaxed ambience too, one of my favorite French restaurants in Singapore."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Great food, Lousy service",positive,40,29-Oct-14,"Set right in the heart of Little India, kailash parbat is one of the better upmarket restaurants. I dined there a couple of times(2 lunches and 1 dinner to be precise) and the food always blew me away. It's a vegetarian restaurant so don't expect to have tangri and kebabs at this place. The ambience is good, prices are okay too but what sucks the most is the cust service. The waiters are rude, don't repeat the orders and seem uninterested in doing their jobs. We still kept going to the same place as we were dead tired after our visits everyday and did not want to experiment. P.S. - Avoid the chaat here. Not worth it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food And Service,positive,40,22-May-12,"Was there for lunch the food was very authentic and there was absolutely no compromise on the flavors.
Nice joint if you cant stay without Indian Food"

French,Saveur,Messy evening,negative,30,15-Jul-17,The service staff seemed inexperienced and frazzled. Half of the time the orders were mixed up or forgotten (had to be prompted before food was served). Duck confeitt was good though! Atmosphere was relaxed
French,Saveur,Too long,negative,20,8-Jul-16,"Waited for food for quite long, the duck starter for the 3 set course is not nice. The kitchen is too loud."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Appetizers,positive,40,3-Feb-18,We went there for dinner primarily because or go-to restaurant urban roti (a few doors down) was closed that day for repairs. It was quite late in the evening (10pmish) but the service was good. Good vegetarian fare - especially the Chole Bhature. The dal makhani was also very good.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local food scene,positive,40,19-Aug-15,"A bit of the local food scene with lots of seafood dishes and a mix of beverages stalls.
A located a short walk away from the MRT and there's lots to choose from."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Indian Food away from India,positive,50,3-Apr-16,"KP ws our favourite place while we were on a holiday 2 singapore. The food is just amazing and the service is very fast. Tried pav bhaji,chole bathura,lassi and even north indian dishes but didnt felt that we are eating at a restaurant outside india. We felt as if we are eating at a indian restaurant in india."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",At par with some of Japan's best,positive,40,16-Sep-14,"Sashimi was one of the freshest I've had in the world. The sushi master chef was a wonder to watch as he yielded his knifing skills, prepared the sushi rice and added just the right amount of wasabi. A tad expensive but you definitely get what you pay for."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Over-rated,negative,30,7-Jul-11,"Having grown up in Malaysia and being a keen cook, I like to think that my palate is quite educated in terms of Malaysian/Singaporean cuisine. We went to Newton Hawker Centre on the recommendation of a hotel staff member. From the start, you feel pressured by the touting. As you arrive, scouts from the various seafood stalls will spot you as tourists and notice your helplessness as you look around for an empty table. Having found you one, they push their menu onto you and, being a pushover, I feel obliged to order something from them. We had an oyster omelette (good), satay (tiny skewers, chewy beef), BBQ skate (tasty but greasy), fried rice and koay teow (both tasteless and rather devoid of protein or vegetable matter). I do concede that we might not have sampled food from the best stalls and that I may be making sweeping generalisations, however, even the food we had from the Kopitiam food court in Vivo City was much better in both taste and variety, and also cheaper. The other thing that detracts is that you have to use flimsy plastic cutlery that gets caught by the strong gusts from the strong oscillating fans, often showering you in food. Also, we were told that there wouldn't be a problem getting back to the hotel as there is a taxi stand there, but this is not the case. Most of the cabs that were dropping off passengers seemed to be enroute to some pre-booked destination. It took us 45 minutes to finally hail down some cabs that hadn't been pre-booked. All in all, an over-rated and disappointing experience. The night after that, we went to Chinatown and had a fantastic meal, both in taste and value. Note that this is in the food court (level 2 of the market building) and not in Food St, which is pretty but looks even more of a tourist trap than Newton. In the Chinatown food court, there are extensive numbers of stalls selling all kinds of foods. Make sure you go early as many were already shut by 8pm."
French,Paul,Will be back again!,positive,50,18-Aug-16,"Recently I was at Paul bakery located at paragon shopping mall. The food was beyond expected, good portioning and was presentable. All the staff had their smiles on definitely very welcoming! Kudos to the team! Will be back again soon!"
French,Saveur,Not given a table sitting although there were free tables,negative,30,13-Jan-17,Came in 20 mins earlier than reservation timing for dinner at 730pm. There was a table clearly free for 7 people but were asked to come back at 730pm. Staff serving should be more flexible to serve the need of the customers.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Messy Dinner,negative,30,06/13/16,"Great place to experience the Singaporean cuisine away from the touristy track. We ordered the chilli Crab, amongst other specialties. The food was excellent but for some reason they are stingy on the hand towels for such a messy meal. It's well priced"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Still good food ,positive,40,29-Mar-16,"I visited Them this week after a break and was glad to see that quality was still good - chutneys were tasty and Podi idli, dosa, uttapam and Pongal - all well made
They could do better with cleanliness of toilets and wash areas though"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic food and Great Service,positive,50,10-Sep-17,"Went to eat out at the restaurant with high expectations which were met easily ! Located in Littke India area, offers good authentic north indian food , suitable for family and friends outing. The ambience and environment is very good. Mushroom matar curry which is not on the menu is brilliant, highly recommended."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",best place for south indian food in Singapore - Ananda Bhavan,positive,50,26-Jul-15,Ananda Bhavan is a best and cheap place to eat south indian food in Singapore. Its in Serangoon Road as well as on Syeed Alwi Road i.e. opposite of Mustafa Center.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The rise and fall of service,negative,20,5-Dec-16,"My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary and were looking forward to a wonderful selection of Japanese food and some quality service. Unfortunately, to our dismay, food wasnt great and service was atrocious. They firstly kept getting our orders wrong and till this day we still wonder where our unagi sushi and spider maki disappeared to. They probably eloped and found a nice little home in a hill unbeknown to us. What more, staff didnt seem happy to serve us and we even saw a few of them trying to communicate in mandarin to the Filipino guys beside us, which was puzzling because they clearly could not understand what the service staff were saying. Apart from the sashimi and stir fried beef, everything else tasted like it came from a salt factory, not sure if they were trying to mask the flavours of the food or kill the bacteria in it. The raw squid tasted like they had talcum powder powdered all over it like a baby's rash filled bottom. Definitely not a place for a first date... But maybe your last..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Limited choices for the value we paid,negative,30,31-Jan-17,Visited the restaurant for the 1st time to celebrate my son's 21st birthday but was a big disappointment. The food quality are average n choices limited. Sashima quality are average as well and there are more Jap buffet we visited are of better choices and comparable in price too.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab with mantou craving satisfied!,positive,40,2/7/2014,"Been craving for chili crab with mantou so had to come and eat here. As usual place is full packed because it's CNY week and i think also the reason why their crabs this time were smaller. We also ordered the pepper club and the cereal prawn. I would say, my craving was satisfied. Had a cool white wine that went with it."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Awesome experience , Delicious & very soft Idly ",positive,50,27-Oct-15,"Great experience from food to the service - it is an experience one must have.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit whilst in singapore for local seafood,positive,50,12-Jan-15,"This place is a must visit whilst in singapore, although slightly touristy now as meals are generally around $6-10 where your local hawker stands are closer to $3-5 per meal, it makes for a cleaner and nice environment from which to enjoy your food.The stall holder will shove menu's in your face as you walk past but this is Asia so you should expect this and be comfortable to just wave your hand and say no thank you. This is part of the atmosphere and I wouldn't have it any other way.A must try is the singapore Chilli Crab which will set you back around $35-$40 for a decent size crab and the fried buns $5 which are great for dipping into the sauce.Also of pretty good quality is the satay chicken sticks which are around $0.60-$0.70 each and come with home made satay sauce with actual crushed up nuts in it. This is an easy to eat family favourite, I would suggest that you need around 10 sticks per head to call this a meal or if it's a snack / entree then go for a mixed plate of them so you can enjoy the different types of meat.Another interesting dish that you won't find in too many other places is the stingray, which is extremely tasty."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great 1-for 1 buffet,positive,40,9-Feb-17,The buffet is value for money if it's 1-for-1 as charges for other items like drinks are over priced. The teriyaki BBQ items are a tad too sweet but salted grill are alright. The sashimi slices are thick and juicy. This is good for regular Japanese fare.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,it's great place to have dimsum!,positive,40,10/6/2015,"it stays in 2nd floor of the building on Temple St., China Town. Opening time is from 09:00 am.it's great place for gathering family. their dim sum is delicious, great & deserved with its price.they will not give you any menu, each staff that takes care for some dishes with trolley; will come to your table and asks whether you would like to have dishes -> such a nice experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value Buffet,positive,40,12-Nov-16,Been here with family for birthday celebration. The selection is pretty good and good value for money. Sashimi is fresh.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food and Good Ambience,positive,40,21-Aug-17,Visited on 19 Aug 17. The restaurant has good ambience. The Indian food was excellent and better than many upscale restaurants in India. The service was prompt and courteous.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",bad,negative,10,7-Jan-12,"overpriced, too much touting and not much good food. it servers more like a tourist destination than a place for locals. i would definitely not recommend this to anyone. the only stall i wouldn't mind having is the XO ba chor mee, but i wouldn't take the effort to go there just to have that."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Place for delicious South Indian snacks in Singapore,positive,40,18-Sep-16,"Indian food is seriously complex to decode as the flavors in itself are so vast and distinct as you travel across the country.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique experience, including the laser light show",positive,50,24-Oct-15,"A Top 100 World list place we just had to try. The location, above the large casino floor, is interesting but the noise is not a factor once you get inside. Seating is bar-like in front of the cooking table with several other diners, but only 6 people a separate room. The tasting menu is very well done, mostly seafood and well presented. The one glitch was no one offered us a drink before dinner nor a wine list. We had to ask if there was wine or wine pairings, after which they said, ""Oh yes"". Once that hurdle was overcome, the wine pairings were quite nice. After dinner and before dessert, you are escorted to a more conventional dining area with a window over the bay. While finishing dessert and coffee, you view the laser light show. A great ending to a wonderful dinner. "
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Good Value for Money,positive,40,3-Nov-11,"Very good buffet, especially the north Indian varieties in it. Good value for money. Personally, I have found the food quallity at their Riverwalk (near Clarke Quay) outlet better than the Farrer Park (Little India) outlet."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Vegitarian yummy,positive,40,29-Sep-16,"The best Bhel Puri I have ever eaten. This is a low key restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Good service and easy surroundings make for an ""I'll be back "" restaurant."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very annoying,negative,10,24-May-12,"You have people asking you to eat at their stand while walking around looking at menus, very annoying when you try have a nice diner without being pushing around. That's unfortunate this centre used to be a good one. People told me that the high rents that stand owners pay make them ""agressive"" toward getting customers... The food quality has also decreased the last 3 years. Avoid this tourist trap."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Big Bang, lotsa buck",positive,50,26-Jun-16,"Tucked away in a discreet corner of an opulent western hotel is this magical enchanting gem of a sushi restaurant. Quiet, understated, discreet. Perfect. Great great great food at the counter. Multiple courses of Japanese seafood delicacies, each more subtle, more intricate than the last. Awesome sushi made in front of your seats, seeing and delivery all part of the charm. Marvellous. Not for the budget conscious. $800 sg for two was not a big spend here so save the pennies! "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Stale food and no feedback form.,negative,20,7-May-16,We ordered for pav bhaji and samosa. Both of them were stale... and smelling. While the restaurant manager took note.... There was no action nor ay kind of apology.... Surprisingly.... Kailash parbat does mot have a feedback form. So there kind of food quality and service matters are either very frequent to maintain track or just dont matter.Next time you visit just ask if they have freshly prepared anything and then order.
French,Saveur,Exceeds expectations,positive,50,3-Jun-16,"The food exceeded my expectations, could tell that much thought was put into cooking the food. Loved the Salmon Confit especially and the cookies and milk."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,22-Oct-16,As a family tour we came here and as usual wanted onky Indian food could satisfy our hunger!!Kailash parbat is best in town and really every night for 10 days we came here and enjoyed a lot!!Very very delicious home like food was served and we were satisfied each and every time! A real value for money
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive for average food,negative,20,6-Apr-15,"Second time round - why didn't I learn from my first experience? - both times were equally disappointing. Its about 500/pax if you dont have a lot of drinks. The food was nothing special - the gimmick is that they cook some dishes in front of like a teppanyaki - but it does mean if you are a couple, the timing of your dishes matches the other couple in the room. Their special is the uni, botan and cavier dish -but standard has dropped from last time because my first time round it was the only earth-shattering dish but this time it was less creamy, didn't blend as well and therefore forgettable. All the dishes were forgettable except for the wagyu beef which was the only good dish in the entire 10 menu. Completely disappointing"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality food,positive,50,17-May-17,This place has never fail to disappoint me. The standard of the sashimi and cooked food (e.g bean sprouts) has maintained over the years.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Out of this world ,positive,50,09/24/15,"If you like the roast duck to be crispy and a bit fat, then you will enjoy this. If you like your duck lean, then this is not for you. We had it for lunch together with wanton noodles which was very good too with the noodles al Dente. Had the roast pork and the famous snow bun. Only problem is they do not allow reservation so you have to go early and queue. Also not many big tables "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,positive,40,12-Nov-17,Buffet spread was quite big but I wished desserts were included. Sashimi was good and I love their stir-fried beef dish!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Taste!!!,positive,50,10-Jul-15,"We head to this place in Little India (Singapore) after reading good reviews about this restaurant at various sites and i must say that ""Kailash Parbat"" didn't disappoint us at all. They serve good quality food with awesome taste which i can call very authentic as well and at quite reasonable price. They have a very nice ambience although and serve almost everything you desire for from an Indian vegetarian restaurant right from chaats to main course dishes with delectable breads (almost all varieties except missi roti which is my husband's favourite) to desserts . Their quantity is good too.We tried their kadhai paneer with tandoori roti there and it was delicious. Later we also had their ras malai which was good too. Next day we tried their gol gappas and dahi bhalla chaat which was delicious as well. Their staff is nice and converse in Hindi & English both which makes you feel that you are sitting in a restaurant in India :). They have two branches in Little India and both of them are very well connected to MRT .We would highly recommend this place as a must visit for anyone craving for delicious and hygienic Indian Vegetarian Food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",At times very good .... average at times,positive,40,30-Jan-18,"We frequent this outlet next to the Temple in Little India and have realized that this place doesn't believe in consistency. At times their puris are stale and have a very strong stale oil aftertaste, at times the yoghurt in the dahi puri is too sour, at times their chole is bland missing the basic spices and seasonings, at times the sandwiches are inedible. Their lunch/dinner menu tells the same story. Unreliable. But the last time we were there, we were in for a treat! the pani puri puris weren't stale, chole was delicious and the paneer tikka sandwich was excellent. Everything was yummy and delicious. In fact we even told the lady who took our order about the good food and the previous letdowns. All the best!"
French,Paul,"Great place for coffee, crepes and eclairs but the service is poor",negative,30,19-May-17,"I like the eclairs, crepes and salads but the service is slow, often irritating. It tends to get busy due to the location. Great for takeaway and I love the caprese panini (tomato and mozzarella). I think it's an old favourite boulangerie and patisserie."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",First Impression,positive,40,6-Nov-16,"Food is good and with a wide selection. Price is affordable too. Crowd was quiet for a Thursday dinner. Service could have been improved, we mentioned to the waitress that we were there for the first time but she didn't explain to us what does the buffet package includes. She only told us to order from the menu with a Samsung tablet. We had to ask a second waiter to know about paying additional for drink."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Midori,negative,20,16-Feb-18,Food quality was not as good as previous round and waiting time was very long as our orders did not pass through the system and wasn't detected by staff. We had to keep asking and resubmit order again..

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Food Experience,positive,40,30-Mar-14,"You have to try a hawkers market when in Singapore. Take your time to look around, and then let one of the ""hawkers"" help you out. Portions are generous, and going from a small to medium raises the price a lot. We ordered too much for three of us, and had to leave a lot on the table. ""The Pirate's Table"" served a very tasty crispy squid dish -- dinner candy! Get some vegetables -- they are delicious. You eat outdoors at concrete tables and off of paper plates. Bring your own napkins and enjoy an Erdinger beer with your dinner. "
French,Paul,Cosy Ambience Diner,positive,40,16-Aug-16,"2nd time back here at MBLM. Dinner is much more tranquil as compared to the lunch. Food didn't disappoint again, service staffs are friendly but a little more attentive would be lovely. However, recommends the dishes well. Had the Confit de canard and a dinner set (Mushroom soup, Chicken & Creme Brûlée & Raspberry Ice Tea). Portioning's decent yet satisfyingly filling. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fatty duck,positive,40,08/17/15,High in demand and patience required for a long wait to obtain a table. Roast pork & duck sell out very fast so order them when you get your queue number. Selection of vegetable dishes was poor.

Be prepared to spend average $350 ( without sake ) and about $500 with sake . If you want to be sensible, go for set lunch ."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi Experience,positive,50,19-Dec-14,"Booked by email for noon, when I got there they could not find the booking. I was alone so they managed to find a seat at the Sushi Counter. You must book, as seats are limited, and I think it just turns around once for lunch.Read about this place in Trip Advisor. Staff was Japanese. Always within a few feet and making sure if glass was empty, or anything they would be there to help.Went for the middle sushi menu and deeply regret not having gone for the larger one, not because I was hungry but because of the experience.Don't go in a Hurry, I thought 12 pieces of Sushi should no take long (I got there at 12 and had a flight at 3). By 1315 I had to ask the chef how many sushis left, and there were still 5 to go. It right have been rude but I had to request him to slowly speed up the last as I had to rush.For each Sushi they open bring a Box from the Fridge underneath, open a Wooden Box, Extract a piece of fish, cut it and make the Sushi. If other diners next to you are at the same pace then they will make for them as well, if not all this procedure to make one Sushi.Rice is warm, perfect temperature to get an amazing taste. Fish amount is perfect. Wasabi is there and not overdone. Spectacular.As you eat he will see your pace and only start the next one when you have finished. Cleans your plate, and soon after places the next Sushi.The taste of Each Sushi was to die for.Regret: That I was not in a hurry and could not enjoy as much as I should have.Left the restaurant wishing to come back asap.It is expensive, each Sushi comes to around 8US$ (not for 2 but for ONE). I hate to say given the quality, to pay US$8 in many high end places for 2 sushis, I find this place comparatively cheap.Nothing to complain. Amazing Sushi experience.(Have read the review from the person who got sick from here. Accidents can happen anywhere, though I would love to know where he had had lunch that day. Food Intoxication can happen anywhere). Do not stop going here because of this review. Don't go if it is beyond your budget, and if you dont like Sushi.By the way No Soya Sauce. my belief is that if the quality of the produce is good, you never need and additives.Writing this and wishing I could eat there again.Thank you for the experience."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,friendly service crew. delicious duck.,positive,50,5/3/2018,Surprised that they have newly opened at Raffles City Basement. The basement is so overwhelmed with food / restaurants that it is easy to overlook these place. Service is consistently good but lighting is extremely dim and ambience is no where as welcoming as Scotts Square. I was there on a weekend and place was almost deserted.
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for Dessert & Drinks,positive,40,23-Sep-16,"Love the ambiance of the place.
However it's pretty pricey.
Didn't have much choice of desserts but the taste was not disappointing"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food ,positive,40,15-Dec-15,"Our preferred Vegetarian only North Indian restaurant in Little India area. Our regular picks are Paneer Tikka, Pani Puri, Dahi papdi chat. Tasty vegetarian dishes for main course and finishing touch with Jamuni Jannat, rasa malai :) Recommend for lunch / dinner with family & friends . "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Value for Money?,negative,30,11/2/2014,"The setup and ambiance is very good. Very Chinese decorations with hostesses in cheongsam. There are many round tables which could sit up to 12-14 pax. We could see that the restaurant has tried to come up with new and special dishes to stand out among the other restaurants. But unfortunately, my family and I agreed that after eating there for 3 times in the last year, the ""unique"" dishes are not as good as the classic dishes. For example, their ""normal"" siew mai is better than their specialty quail egg siew mai. Overall, though the food is average, i felt that the price was slightly high considering the quality of food. But I must say that the setting of the restaurant was very cosy."
French,Saveur,No coffee at Saveur during lunch hours,negative,30,31-Mar-16,"We were disappointed to be told that there wasn't any coffee left at 12.30pm on a week day. I was treating my friend to a farewell lunch and she had wanted a flat white but the server said (very nicely though) that they had run out of coffee, which is a little weird since it was only start of service. The irony: I much preferred the menu at Concetto before they became Saveur!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Takoyaki A Major Score ,positive,50,12-Mar-17,The kids felt like having Japanese so we decided to call at Shin Minori to allow them to select what they liked. Buffet was around $37 per pax and the selection variety was good. Sashimi was fresh so we had two servings. The rest of the dinner was featured with a surprise find of Takoyaki. The kids loved this street food in our recent trip to Japan. It was a key highlight of the evening! 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin), Buffet Lunch ,positive,50,10/14/16,"Great food Excellent service from Bowie, Terry and Christine , the buffet lunch is value for money will bring more friends to try. Hope the chef could come out with more favorable dish...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad place with a standard food,negative,20,1-Oct-13,"The food seller is pretty aggressive and annoying, not like any other hawker center.
The food price is a bot high, maybe it is because there're too many advertising promoting this place, so they tend to put higher price for their food."
French,Saveur,Disappointing...,negative,20,9-Mar-17,"Used to patroniseat their first Outlet at purvis street. Much as we had to queue for a long time, the wait was very well worth it.. menu has changed and the popular dishes were either removed or didn't taste as nice as before.. sorry last visit!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy CNY set menu,positive,50,2/12/2018,"I normally am not a fan of set menu as I like to mix and match my own. I can’t tonight because it is their busiest time of the year hence everyone has to choose a set of dinner from their menu. We chose the SGD348+++ menu and I must say surprisingly we all enjoy our meal very much!!! The food is fresh, well cooked and simply delicious. The dessert is fantastic, grapefruit coconut pudding with fresh mango. Their service despite a full house is impeccable. They change our plate after serving one dish and keep checking on us if we need anything. We will definitely go back again. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE- AMAZING!!,positive,50,7-Apr-11,"I cannot believe that this restaurant has gotten so many poor reviews...i thought it was absolutely fantastic. We came to singapore for only one night after a 2 week trip in cambodia, vietnam and laos. I saw this restaurant as listed as one of the top restaurants and since my family and I are very into fine dining we decided to give this place a try and we were NOT disappointed.Yes, it is VERY expensive so i do not suggest going there if you will be upset about spending all of that money on food- do not go if have budget restraints! However, if you get past that, the dining experience is incredible. We walked into the restaurant and were seated by the charming australian sommelier . He really made our experience. He chose amazing wines for us in our wine pairing. As the other reviews said, you sit in rooms for 5 to 6 people and since my family is 5 we had one all to ourselves. The service was quite attentive and the time between meals was great. Now, for the food...i do not have my menu with us so i don't know every exact name of the dishes but here it goes: our first dish was some exotic fish that reminded me of a tuna belly or hamashi but it was fantastic...very fresh. The thing about the food here is that it is not like allinea in chicago (LOVED) or fat duck (which i didnt like)...the chefs not into molecular gastronomy. The food is just the best ingredients (Thats why they charge so much) done simply and SO well...therefore, some people can misconstrue this simplicity as a waste of money...it's very difficult to do food the way they did even though it seems very simple. The only dish i was not crazy about was the sea urchin which is their speciality. I had sea urchin at Charlie Trotters in Chicago and i liked it better there. However, the kobe was phenomenol and i don't even like crab and i loved it there. The ingredients are so fresh that the menu changes daily (even though i don't completely buy that...it's mainly the same but a few things change like the deserts). One of my favorite dishes of the night was the egg with truffles and potato...SO delicious. The portions are nice sized but theres only about 6 real dishes (i don't count the soup) and then you're moved to the other room for desert. The room has a nice view and it's a great atmosphere change. We had melons and a cheese cake and the deserts were fantastic...a lot of times these 3 Michelin type restaurants mess up the deserts but their signature cheese cake was great. They ended you off with petit fours but thats it...that's always a disappointment when they don't do anything more at the end of such a nice meal...we always look forward to what we called ""the punches""-- the extra deserts at the end that are not on the menu but here's a heads up if you're into that. We ended up with a nice desert wine and some zambuca and a large check...but from the food to the sommelier and the experience, it's worth the money if you can afford it and appreciate cooking at its best."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Fantastic Chips,positive,40,13-Nov-13,"Came here with my family and although it was a bit pricey the food was very good. The steak was tender and had lots of flavours, but definitely come for the chips. They were very crunchy, like they were deep fried three times, and they have unlimited friesIf your in Singapore, and your in need of something french or something else besides Asian, come to Les bouchons, and you also get a great view"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Decent..,positive,40,31-Dec-15,"As with most restaurants in little india,
cramped for space. Menu options limited for dinner time. Good varieties of chutneys were available but 2 of them tasted very similar , room for improvement here. AC runs very slowly and just not enougb on a crowded...More"
French,Angelina_MBS,Nothing out of the ordinary...,negative,30,6-Mar-16,We went to Angelina in December 2015 and give it a try for their pastries as it was well advertised in various magazines or newspaper. we cant really share all the hype mentioned and it was nothing what sets them apart from a Laduree or Antoinette to be honest. High prices for a slightly more then average quality and service.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi. Fresh rolls,positive,40,24-Dec-15,"Clean interior, good service and fresh sashimi. Good presentation of food. Food is very savory. Nice variety of sashimi, sushi, taco rolls, noodles and other dishes. Try the crispy chicken and sorbets. Beverages not included. Refills on tea. Adults $39 and kids $29. Service is quick and staff friendly. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Rustic,negative,30,02/18/15,"Crystal jade standards have certainly dropped over the years and Imperial Treasure is the chain to go for good chinese food. Anyway, we couldn't stand the line for kiddy Nakhon in holland village and popped by Crystal jade for the dinner alternativeit's chinese new year season so we ordered the yusheng and well as standard dishes - roast meat combo, stir fried vegetables, tofu in claypot and sweet and sour fish. They were all ok/average, and hence the problem for crystal jade. it's not enough to be just ok these daysOverall, a rustic, ok place for a meal. don't expect anything special"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,positive,50,11/14/15,"We only had one night in Singapore on a stop over. We made reservations after we were recommended it by a friend from Singapore and we're glad that we did as this place is very busy. We went for the set menu and tried the razor clams, noodles la la and black pepper crab. It was all delicious...if not a little messy to eat! Would highly recommend, not too expensive. 148 dollars for 2 people set menu which was more than enough food. Full of locals and ex-pats, a taxi is needed to get there."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent chat items ,positive,50,19-Dec-17,"Excellent choice of chat items, so much of variety. My fav is Pav Bhaji. But it is mostly crowded due to Mustafa proximity. But they make tasty food. Some items can be really spicy - check before ordering !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sinful steak & fries,positive,40,2-Jun-18,"This bistro style steak and fries place is a must visit if you want a relaxed evening without getting dressed to the nines.Just pull on your smart casuals and go there. Start with an order of buttered escargot. One of the best I have eaten. Dip chunks of bread into the butter sauce and enjoy the snails.For mains there are only 2 choices and of course you go for the steak & fries. The steak is covered in their signature sauce which you will definitely polish off with the fries after you are done with the meat. Admittedly my plate was as clean as Oliver Twist’s bowl. Greed has no limits and I enjoyed a House Dessert which was a white lava cake out of which oozed a whole lot of caramel sauce. Don’t miss it. Your visit will be incomplete.If you are in Singapore for a short trip or a long stay, do try to visit L’Entrecote. It’s worth it.Note: Go to the outlet at 36 Duxton Hill as it has indoor seating. The outlet at Orchard Road only has deck seating. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",A good restaurant but expensive,positive,40,3-Feb-17,Good food but the hotel is very expensive as compared to other restaurants in singapore for Indian food. A little difficult to find it too.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Too expensive for average food,negative,20,11-Jul-15,"I've been to many top restaurants around Singapore but Waku Ghin was the most disappointed restaurant on my list. This was my first time here and will never ever come back to this over-rated restaurant. I was served with cheap and low quality seafood for $400/pax. A bottle of water is $20sgd. One small boston lobster was served for 4 people... Small abalones werent even from Australia and the beef was cheap. I think with the money I spent, I can fly to Japan to eat something better. Avoid this place if you expect good food for $400/pax. "
French,Paul,Excellent Meal,positive,40,30-Mar-13,"Had a really good breakfast at Paul's. Salmon, with turkey ham and eggs were were really great. It can be considered pretty pricey as they charge $8.80 for freshly squeezed orange juice, but the ambience is pretty good. Its a must try for me. :)"
French,Saveur,Good food with decent pricing,positive,50,10-Mar-17,"Together we ordered the mushroom soup, salmon confit, seabass, duck confit, pistachio panna cotta and the salted caramel lava. All didn't disappoint.
The only down point was we had to constantly ask the staff was our water to be refilled."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Not impressed ,negative,20,27-Mar-16,"Ordered spring rolls and samosa for entree they were a disgrace, no better and probably were, cheap frozen finger food.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Best Crab Curry,positive,40,7-Jan-14,"Muthu Curry's Crab curry is one of the best i have tasted so far. It's made of special spices and have a unique taste. plus it's value for your money,"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good place for lunch,positive,50,12/14/16,"It was my first time visited this restaurant, delicious food and awesome service. The staff are friendly and the dim sum buffet is quite reasonable. Highly recommend this restaurant for dining."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gerat but be aware of what you need to do,positive,40,22-Jul-12,"This is a Singapore must do. But there are a few rules:1. NEVER listen to the touts as you come in, just smile and nod, if they touch you just say ""molest!!"", they will back off,2. Get a table, leave someone there and go around alook for food,3. the drink sellers will come to your table - buy from them but check the price first - they all speak english, if they dont, then order from someone who does,4. NEVER buy from food touts - they will cheat your blind on price and demand S$ 45 per prawn or something ridiculous - these guys prey on stupid tourists,5. NEVER order unless you have an agreed or signboarded price,6. If you have any hassles, then get the stall number or the touts number. If they become agressive, call 999 and the police will come. I have called 999 many times and the cops here are excellent at sorting this thing out. Just DO NOT BECOME AGGRESSIVE OR SWEAR/OATH.My personal favourite is Ah Hengs carrot cake - it is a good mate and he knows all the people there. Just remember that it is a game for the touts etc. just smile and ignore them. But be careful of some of the local partons especially late at light. They can be very nasty.Selamat makan...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wonderful Tonight!,positive,50,13-May-16,Food was really good and the sashimi was fresh! My three kids (six to nine) had a good time helping themselves to the sashimi and the yakitori. My wife and I had a good spread of the food available and also plates and plates of sashimi! Service was good as well and its definitely one of the best dining experience we ever had! Must return again! :) 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Popular place for locals,positive,40,27-Jan-17,We had a fine dinner at this restaurant. True vegetarian restaurant offering wide variety of foods. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. Prices were okay for the area and the facility.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Local Sout East Asia street food , all the flavour risk free",positive,50,24-Aug-17,"I have been visiting Newton Circuss Hawker center since 30 years ago. Convenient - MRT (Metro) station across the street. A short walk (10 mins) form bussy commercial district of Orchard Road.Dozens of food kiosks and stalls with tasty and delicious local meals prepared on the spot. fast food, NO JUNK food.It can be crowdy... anytime. specially at conventional dinner times. Id that is the case... just be patient and be fast to grab a table. or just look around to make your mind on wtah to eat.. and take out or eat on the go.It is open air. No air Con. it is pàrt of the experience.Hygiene standards high and above average in asian street foof (a big ++ for westerns sensitive guts)The biggest challenge.... to decide what to eat with such temting array os scents and flavours ... and all the owners ""self-promoting"" as the best among the rest. Tough choices,"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Miles away and miles in front of his Sydney restaurant,positive,40,26-May-14,"The product that Tetsyua uses in this restaurant is quite amazing, the dishes are simple, yet they still seem to change on the 3 visits we have had. His Sydney restaurant over the years has become dull and boring, though this is where you can feel a new sense of energy in the dining private communal rooms. Everything was faultless, the abalone and wagyu courses were divine!. Only qualms I could have were the service staff seemed a little lost for such an establishment."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To get business relaxed ,positive,50,08/18/15,"Long Beach is absolutely one of the best restaurants after hours of business negotiations. The noisy and busy atmosphere, the beer jug and the job with the crabs keeps your discussions not just in business but helps to get everyone relaxed. You can watch how the experienced waiter pulls the crab apart, don't even try to do it yourself. You are able to watch the fishes to swim in the aquarium which shows how fresh the food actually is. The service, well, don't expect too much of it because the restaurant is full of local people and the waiters are busy to serve those who are loud enough to get the attention. Some junior waiters don't even understand a word of English. Anyway we got very good service and good recommendations also about what to eat. Our menu was meant to 3-4 persons and it costed just some 250 SGD. A jug of Tiger Beer was 27 SGD. We were happy and will go definitely back. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Best South Indian Breakfast I ever had,positive,50,25-Feb-14,The south Indian thali Breakfast is hearty delicious and awesome value for money. Please do visit this place if you like authentic south Indian food outside India
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Chef recommended set meal is awful,negative,20,6/3/2017,"Went there on a Friday with my Friend and was recommended the Chef recommended set meal and you can't believe it's from a restaurant of this standard.First after the first two dishes we had to wait more than half an hour for the next dishes while our eight ERS were already served two dishes. Second they served Wagyu beef but the sauce was too sweet and the sweetness overpowered all the taste and you couldn't even tell if it was Wagyu beef, really terrible.Third the entrance was some kind of sweet and sour fish but again it was extremely sweet as if eating sugar.Good for our long waiting the manager offered some roast meat and duck.Advise if you go to this place; don't ever order the set meal as it's really crap.Order the traditional Cantonese à la carte menu, roasted meat, dim sum or fried rice.Tasted the god as if it was hawker food and then when the bill of $217.00 came, really not worth and agreed with my Friend that better we ordered some roast meat, Cantonese soup and some vegetables.Bottom line again don't order any set meal there you'll be completely disappointed."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Don't believe the hype. Go to the Tippling Club instead.,negative,10,8-Oct-14,"We had high expectations of this restaurant on the basis of glowing reviews and previous positive meals at Tetsuya's in Sydney but sadly these were ill founded. The meal was good for the most part but not great but certainly not worth $400 per head. The 10 course menu is very meagre and small items which would usually be considered amuse bouche or palate cleansers are included as full courses. 2 or 3 of the dishes were memorable but not knock-out, including the kobe beef though this could also have been down to the fact that the portion size was so small - only half a small steak each. Dessert was small (notice a theme here!) and slightly boring. The options for those with dietary restrictions are also unspectacular and lacking in variety. My husband's first two substitute dishes looked identical. In addition, they were not prepared on the teppan and appeared from a hidden kitchen leaving diners with restrictions feeling less carefully catered for and therefore distinctly unloved. The sommelier had no idea about the wine selection and suggested entirely inappropriate but expensive wines despite a very careful description of what we wanted. Overall, a very disappointing experience. We had been fortunate enough to have a superb meal at The Tippling Club in Tanjong Pagar a few days beforehand which was truly spectacular and less than 2/3 of the price of Waku Ghin. If you want something really special, head to The Tippling Club instead and ask for a seat at the counter where you'll see some really interesting cooking in their open plan kitchen."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",BEST SUSHI IN SINGAPORE!,positive,50,23-Dec-14,This was one of the best sushi experiences and the best in Singapore. The lunch sushi sets are value for money.

Impeccable presentation!Pricy but worth every penny!!!Highly recommended!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hit and miss....,negative,30,5-Feb-16,Some vendors are bad. Some are good. This is a tourist trap. Prices are higher than other place. If you want to try chili crab and xereal prswns. Expect to pay around 100 sg. 40 sg for crab 25 to 40 for prawns depends on size of plate you order. Tables always full but you can find a seat. Alot of people eat and leave. Tried to order satay from 1 vendor told me sold out... but had alot of sticks still in stall.Tried to order oyster egg. Vendor told me dont order unless you willing to wait 30 mins. Crab was nothing special. Boiled crab. Pour chili sauce on it.Cereal prawns. Fresh and ok... but not my type of dish.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good,positive,40,26-Apr-17,Most of the food are not bad. Sashimi are cold enough. The staff cleared the plate very fast after you finish eating.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,terrible service; fair food,negative,10,4/10/2013,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel (Conrad Centennial) and was also in the DK Eyewitness Travel Book. I asked for a table by the window and they said it was for a larger group; but then they sat two people there. We had a variety of waitresses, all of whom could care less. Ordered a springroll, bok choy, and duck. they first brought the bok choy, much later the spring roll, and fianlly the duck. The quality of the food was good but the service was abominable, and the order of the food was really strange. At the end of the meal when we received the check they charged us for the handiwipes (they never gave us napkins) and for nuts on the table that we never ate. All in all, a big disappointment and really poor service with an attitude."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Ethnic tasting Indian cuisine. ,positive,40,13-Sep-18,Stumbled upon this resturant by pure connivance. My mother is a falooda lover. Different types of falooda are served here all tasting amazing. The sandwiches had a very rustic taste only found in some places in india so i was more than glad to visit this fine establishment twice during my visit to singapore. The staff ( specially the waiter who has a sister in saudi) made us feel extremely welcome and engaged in conversation and helping us to choose from the menu. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Once in lifetime experience! ,positive,50,20-Jan-16,"The price made me worry, it's the most I have spent on a meal and our bill was around $1400 for my wife and I, but we had said yes to everything and his included cocktails, beers, sparkling water and sake. We said yes to all options! The service, food and ambience is 2nd to none and had the most lovely feeling about it. It's quiet, no music and we were whispering, it all added to the feel and experience. The food is stunning and has so much quality, each of the 10 courses and 3 deserts, were world class and were presented in a way that even foodies like my wife were forced to take pics of each meal. All the photos shown are a true reflection of the amazing attention to detail they show on every step of your experience. It was like a performance, as you watch them prepare most of the courses right in front of you and we were sorted with just 2 other couples, but still felt very private as they speak to each group separately and we never feel like a group or anything. It was the one booking we made well in advance of course and planned and we do not regret it. We took to the 2nd sitting at 8:30pm so I suggest to watch the laser show first, then hot the casino for a look and then to dinner. It's all a few mins walk from each over.This place deserves its popularity and demand and we are impressed and delighted to encourage people to make this a special occasion experience. We will never forget his meal and their attention to detail. "
French,Paul,A Taste of France,positive,40,10-Feb-15,"We went to this place last night for our monthsary dinner. Surprisingly there was no queue because most of the time it's fully packed whenever I pass by. We had a table reservation and we got a table outside the resto. These are the dishes that we tried:Confit de Canard - this is a classic dish of the Perigord region of France. It's a slow roast herb marinated duck leg with roasted vegetables and cranberry sauce. The meat was so tender and complimented well with the cranberry sauce. This is a must-try at Paul.Saute' de poulet aux champignons - these are roasted chicken chunks in mushroom sauce with Paul's country bread. I like the mushroom sauce, it's so creamy. They give a generous serving of the bread too.Pistachio Macarons Frappe - this made from macarons blended with vanilla cream and milk. I actually tried this because I was curious on how it would turn out. It was good and you can feel the macarons as you take a sip. It's not bad but I just realized that macarons should just be eaten as itself and not as a drink. Tartelette Citron Meringueé - this is a lemon cream tartlet with soft meringue. I absolutely loved this! Usually I judge basing on how it looks like on the menu and It was my partner who actually ordered it. But when I tried it, it was divine. I ended up eating most of the portions. HahaPure Jee - its a chocolate mousse blob which is considered the darkest chocolate pastry at Pauls'. I'm not an avid fan of chocolates but it's still good. The chocolate mousse inside the blob is rich, thick and at time crunchy. I would say that I would definitely come back to eat here as there are still a lot of nice listings in their menu like the crepes, éclairs and tarts."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Average Restaurant,negative,30,22-May-17,We had lunch in our package. Food was ordinary. Not hot. Could not serve big group. Price @ 800/- per person is too costly in Singapore for single meal.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",good sushi but overpriced a bit,positive,40,22-Aug-15,"i would say it might be a good sushi restaurant overall. But i doubt it can be really claimed as best sushi outside Japan. I would expect better food given it's ranked top 50 asian restaurant among just a few Singapore restaurants. nice place with good privacy and intimate. The Japanese chef is professional and friendly. what's more, he can speak some English, same as Japanese waitress. Service is good. I ordered 9piece sushi lunch set given limited lunch time. It starts with a few very ordinary sushi in terms of quality of sashimi on the top. but toro and prawn sushi was excellent. i think the quality of sushi is good but just not the quality of the material (most are just ordinary material we can try at normal japanese restaurant). with tax and service charges, it costs ~SGD90 for the set, which is a bit overpriced. Their dinner is super expensive, al SGD250+"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Finally Ceavings Satisfied,positive,50,24-Jul-17,"While cravings were lingering ard unsatisfied, chanced upon the restaurant while driving pass. Decided to drop in to have Pani Puri. To add on had few more items which were worth trying. Must try dishes will include Sev Puri n Dahi Puri (my fav). Even the drinks were gd, coffee had nice aroma n taste, tea was equally good and Lime Soda which was refreshing. A definitely ""wanna go again"" place."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent omakase!,positive,50,20-Dec-14,"Our dinner was a great experience, sitting at the sushi bar (of the St. Regis) and being served directly and non-stop by the head chef who was friendly and fun. We went for the omakase and did not regret it as all items served were top-quality, and very tasteful. Serving staff was excellent, quick, but not intrusive, while the overall ambiance was very nice. Was it one of the greatest sushi meals one could have? Potentially yes. Was it worth the SGD 400 per person (incl. drinks)? Probably not. Point of improvement: they could introduce a long list of Japanese whiskies."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food with very good ambience,positive,40,31-Aug-14,"I have visited Kailash Parbat on multiple occassions with famly, friends during different times like lunch, evening snacks and dinner. the ambience is very good here compared to many other restaurants in the surrounding areas. The service is also good. The place is nice and clean.They have the chats as well as regular ala carte menu. The staff is helpful. Once I wanted to order a Sindhi dish and the waiter was good enough to suggest that it is very spicy an unless I really wanted to give it a try, I should stay away from it.I have tried chats here. They are good. You cannot compare them with what is available in places like Goa & Mumbai. But they are one of the best in Singapore. The quantity is good. There was only one instance when I went for a dinner just before diwali and felt the service was impacted. Probably it was too crowded. Inspite of asking the waiter to serve the soup after finishing the chat, somehow soup ended on the table before the chat was served. The reason given was the chat counter was too busy and our order was still being served.I would definitely recommend this place for those people who are pure vegetarians. If you want to spend a quite evening without being disturbed in the crowded little India side, this place is good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great atmosphere and food,positive,40,11/21/13,Yum cha in Chinatown is a must and we stumbled on this restaurant. The entrance can be a bit tricky to find but people will point the way. It was Sunday so very busy and the waitress helped by bringing dishes we pointed to in the menu to our table (although it's more fun to choose from the trolley especially if you have no idea what it is). Some of the dishes are pretty standard but we had a few exceptional ones as well eg the crab and five treasures soup. It was a little pricey as we got stung for extras on the table (peanuts) and we think a ten dollar surcharge. But it was fun.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Endearing curry temple ,positive,40,30-Dec-16,"A bit chaotic but nice staff, food is good but a bit pricey- as usual around Dempsey. You walking around Dempsey and craving a fish head curry (and you are not in a hurry) this is a great spot."
French,Poulet,Perfect food and very good people,positive,50,20-Oct-16,"I eat several times here as i stay long in jurong east, it is hard to find a place if you dont book in the weekend so only by this you can see that it is a good place, i advice the mushroom soup, paris salad and lamb hank"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peach Blossoms,positive,40,08/20/12,Food and service very good...atmosphere was great.....but expensive and drink prices a little over the top
French,Paul,Good for a snack or meal,positive,40,7-Jul-16,"A great place for taking a break from power-shopping. The coffee is very good, as is the comprehensive range of French cuisine. I thoroughly recommend it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of my Favourite Dining experiences!,positive,50,14-Jan-15,"Waku Ghin was one of the best meals I've had in my life - completely memorable.Having dined at many michelin/san pellegrino top 50 restaurants/hatted, usually most meals blur together making it hard to remember.Per Se is probably my favourite restaurant and one that i remember clearly and Waku Ghin is probably up there also.The food was amazing, the showmanship and experience made it a wonderful night out."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an open air place to dine local fare,negative,30,9-Jul-16,"took a few Aussies for dinner to sample the array of local and regional fare available.
A bit of a disappointment unfortunately."
French,Paul,Choose sweet over savoury,negative,30,30-Apr-18,"We came here for lunch and had a chicken salad and chicken salad roll (or pain in French). The roll wasn’t flavoursome or crunchy, the overall taste ok. The salad had a lot of leaves and a very sharp vinegar dressing, and took longer to arrive than the roll! Don’t choose the savoury option here, stick to the sweet offerings and you’ll have a better dining experience."
French,L_Angelus,Great French Bistro Style Food,positive,50,8-Jun-12,"If you are looking for good quality and pretty authentic bistro style French food this is one of the places in Singapore to have it. Definitely go the Escargot for starter, assuming you like this type of thing, all the mains are great with good options for all tastes. My favorite is the duck and always check for what's on specials for the day. Wine list is good with a fair selection and a good range of pricing for Singapore.As with most good French restaurants be weary as the portions, both starters and mains are generous and generally very rich, have rarely gotten through three proper courses so if you are not a big eater decide early whether you are going for desert, if you like it there are great choices and the Creme Brûlée is almost a must."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fantastic Food and Service,positive,50,3/7/2012,"Was a little put off by some of the reviews but we found this restaurant fantastic. Couldnt fault the food or the service.We had the afternoon tea (buffet all you can eat). They came around with push-carts and the manager was very attentive. We asked for a particular dish that didnt seem to be on any of the carts and after about 5 mins a lady brought us a plate to the table... they had made the dish especially for us and you could tell how fresh all the dishes tasted.We did seem to be the only Westeners there, but doesnt that say its good, eat where the locals eat is our motto.Much smaller than Maxim's in Hong Kong but just as good we thought."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Very good place for South Indian tiffin,positive,40,23-May-15,"The place is one of the best places to eat tiffins. I like their varieties of chutneys. The areas of improvement are to have food available in the menu advertised. Also expand lunch menu to dinner menu. The problem here is for dinner menu, there...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Perfect for group gathering,positive,50,9-Jul-16,"My friends and I had a private room to ourselves as there were 11 of us. The restaurant has an extensive range of food for the buffet menu, and our food arrived within 10 minutes after we place our order. Food was fresh and generous cut for sashimi, definitely worth our money!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Decent choice for dim sum,negative,30,11/12/2016,Tried the main outlet in Chinatown for lunch this week. We had 6 different dim sum options and some porridge - all were pretty good and the service was quite efficient. Not too crowded on a Friday lunchtime so no need for a reservation. Worth another visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Stall 70 Seafood,positive,40,2-Nov-13,"Some seagood is sold by weight so be aware for lobster & tiger prawns, otherwise price known before ordering. Mrs Tan will do gluten free sauces or hold on the side, no-one else understood our request. Yummy, quality fresh fish. Search carefully as some venders don't have the same quality (frozen). Walked from the Royal Plaza (fantastic) on Scotts. Great local experience..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a miss if you are extra sensitive to strong smells,negative,30,13-Apr-14,"For vegetarians, it is a worst place to go. It smells like hell and I eat non-veg stuff pretty frequently, and still I couldn't stand the smells. The look and feel is of course, third world and not clean as per Singapore standards. If you want a cheap eat and can stand smells, go for it. Otherwise, skip it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Very Average and Very Rushed Experience,negative,20,5-Jan-17,"The idea for this restaurant is a good one, but it is poorly executed. I agree with other reviewers about the patrons being packed in too close together. My main beef though (pardon the pun) is with the service. We were barely inside the door 15 minutes when our mains were served. This is really not on in a restaurant that is less than half full. Wine prices were steep relative to the modest quality of the food. The short point is this: the Duxton Road/Hill precinct is packed with better value options - you don't need to chance your arm here."
French,Poulet,"So unlike French chicken
So unlike good food",negative,10,23-Oct-13,My wife who is French and I visited this outlet and was shocked by the lacklustre taste of the chicken apart from a sickly soy sauce it was disgusting the mash was a milky liquid akin to syrupUnseasoned and unedible the veg was greasy and over cooked in all after nine years here we agreed the worst food we have hadDoes not even deserve one star To be honest absolute crap
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great tour stop,positive,40,04/30/15,"We took the Singapore Chinatown By Night tour and one of the stops was for a meal at ""Yum Cha"". What a brilliant, yet simple, meal. There were 12 on the tour and we were seated at two tables with 6 on each. We love Chinese food and it was really good in a way that everyone could enjoy. The way the locals were tucking in to their food showed that they were enjoying their experience too. It looked like it would be a great place to eat at any time. The only problem was that we were kept waiting, on of the party spent too much time in the markets!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good as always :-),positive,50,7-May-17,good service but food was served rather slower than usual but maybe because it was full house :-) sashimi was not as fresh as before for this visit but will come back again!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A totally different experience,positive,50,6-Nov-17,"Visited the bar and had a la carte menu. It was a totally different experience! You cannot have this great Japanese cuisine even if your are in Japan. The service was perfect! At the end, we had beautiful desserts like gems. Certainly I will try what they have at the main table next time in the near future. Worth visiting Singapore for only having dinner here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is good,positive,40,28-Mar-15,"For a long time me & my family wanted to have chaat from Kailash Parbat. We tried paani puri & Kailash Parbat chaat platter. The platter had 4 different chaats. The quantity was good enough for 2 people to share. Infact 2 of us & our 6 years daughter could not finish all the chats along with paani puri. If I remember the 4 chaats in the platter they were bhel puri, paapdi chaat, Dahi bhalla and shev puri. The taste was good. The combination of spices, puris and tomatoes & carrots was well balanced. I remember trying one of the chaat at nearby shop named Bikanerwala. It was not at all up to the expectation. Coming back to chaat from Kailash Parbat, paani puri was a bit of letdown for us. They server puri stuffed with potatoes and the water separately. We had to mix it before eating. In my opinion the paani is the heart & soul of paani puri which adds the tangy, sweet & spicy flavor to it. It was missing. Next time for sure I will give a miss to paani puri. Definitely the chaats which I have tied previously & the platter on this occasion are much better. If you are coming to expect the same taste as the chaats that you get in Mumbai or Goa where I come from, you might be little disappointed. We are used to a bit more tangy & spicy chaats. But other places where I have tried chaats they are similar to the ones available in Singapore in terms of taste & ingredients. If you are a chaat lover give a try for different chaats available in Kailash Parbat. I am sure i will visit this place again for chaats in future. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top Sushi,positive,50,5-Dec-14,"Stumbled on to this place first night in Singapore. Was not disappointed. First class sushi in a simple but nice dining room with attentive staff and great chef. One of the best sushi meals I have had.Fair to say it is not at all cheap but the quality of the ingredients, the care in preparation and the overall experience means it is worth every penny.Also fair to say that the omakase (chef's choice) dining style means that you might get some unusual ingredients. A few reviewers seem to have been put off by this. However, if you are brave, all of the food is an experience. If not, we saw quite a few diners ask the chef to steer clear of unusual items and they were graciously accommodated.Well deserved it's good reputation on TA. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Average to good,negative,30,10/31/15,"Dim sum is average to good. Service is fine. Have to there many times.. Like their new year raw fish salad, very tasty....."
French,Saveur,What's the point of having good food when there is a bad service and poor attitude?,negative,10,25-Jul-16,"I was really hesitating to write this review. However, it is still kind of disturbing for me to recall this bad experience I had in Saveur Cathay. I was with my family that day and have made a restaurant reservation via Chope app. Upon arrival, we are served by this Philippino staff (looks like the restaurant supervisor, who is at the same time attending to the cashier). Initially, she served us with a smile and took our food and drink orders. We ordered only plain water (fyi, plain water costs 30 cents each). We have ordered 4 glasses of warm water and 1 glass of cold water. She repeated our orders as clear as crystal. However, moments later, she turned up to our table with the wrong order (it becomes 4 glasses of cold water and 1 glass of warm water). Instead of apologising for serving us the wrong order, she blamed me and insisted I was the one giving her the orders. I was so angry and pissed and at the same time, she did the roll-eye expression and she did not even apologise at all. Moreover, she just left the water and walked away.What kind of attitude is this, I was thinking. I tried to move on yet our food orders turned out to be wrong too. It was a total mixed up and luckily my hubby took the initiative and went up to clarify all our orders again with her. Imagine this??!?! What service is this when I am actually paying for the service charge?I cannot believe this... At the end of our dinner, when I was making the payment, she did not even bother to communicate to us and just handed us the total amount (where I have to manually offset the chope voucher myself with the bill) and just asked me ""CASH OR CREDIT"". Seriously, is this the way how Saveur survived through these years? Correct me if I am wrong... I did not remember Saveur to be like this, I had my many lunchs and dinners in Saveur (Bugis Purvis Street) and it was really one of my top most choices. Now.. after this bad experience, plus with my family members there, I will not go and visit anymore EVEN the food was good.I will also advise my friends to think twice about visiting Saveur.. I rate this establishment with a 3'D's.. Disappointed, Dismay, Discomfort & Definitely Disgusted!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent,positive,50,11/13/17,I am not a frequent contributor but i needed to write about Peach Blossoms. The only thing better than the service was the food. The best Dim Sum I have ever had. Lookup Alden Gan the manager.and the best waitress in Singapore Mun Fung...they will look after you a treat
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Heaven!,positive,40,4/7/2016,"I am from the U.S. so I may not have many good experiences with real Chinese bar b q. I am in love with this place and am so glad I was able to stop by for a bite of heaven. The roast pork here was awesome. I love how the meat is marbled with fat and then a thin crispy skin, there is no thick layer of fat that I am accustomed to here in the states. Can't wait to come back."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,negative,30,28-May-17,The food standard dropped since the last we went last year. The service of the staff was also not up to standard.

French,L_Angelus,Great French bistrot evening,positive,40,12-Jun-12,"This would be one of my favourites in Singapore: friendly, straightforward and delicious French fare. The prices are on the expensive side, but this is Singapore and French food tends to be pricey.We had the streak tartare -freshly prepared in front of your table, the onion soup and the grilled foie gras.The bistrot has a basic but workable wine list: we went for a couple of glasses of Côtes du Rhone and some sparkling water.All selections were delicious and well presented, and the staff was courteous and professional. We did not have dessert, as the mains were quite filling.Expect to pay about SGD120 per person with light wine consumption.In all, a very pleasant evening. We are coming back to L'Angelus."
French,Paul,Overhyped,negative,30,31-Dec-12,"We were in Takashimaya and we decided to try Paul. First, the queue to get a seat was long. A combination of reasons we guessed - lots of first timer diners trying out, diners were taking a long time to decide and service was slow. Yes, service was a let down. That was a combination of factors too - possible new waiters/waitresses, cramp seating space and the kitchen can't get the orders out at the same time.The food was nothing to shout about. I believe there are other pastry eateries/bakeries with equal or better baquettes, macaroons, lemon tarts and crepes and without a famous name and/of a popular location like Paul.If you have lots of time (as mentioned the queue is long), a couple (if your group is more than a couple, your wait will be longer) and no place to go in Takashimaya, then Paul could be your place. The service may continue to be poor. After all, as long as the queue is long getting in, Paul is still happy."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab never eaten among South East Asia,positive,40,03/23/14,It was my best place I ate a very good crab in Singapore @ Long Beach 'Dempsey' & among the South East Region!I really enjoyed the place.Very well known / Famous place !!The service is quiet good and followed within time but sets order by order!Anyway I really enjoyed eating my Crab from Sri Lanka !

French,Paul,Paul @ Tanglin Mall: Service needs improvement,negative,30,4-Jul-16,"We decided to go to Paul at Tanglin Mall for brunch on Mother's Day. Being a family of 3 (2 adults and a baby), we didn't book and didn't need to as there were tables available. We ordered a croque madam, eggs, and waffles for dessert. Strangely, the dessert arrived first followed by the croque madam. My husbands savory dish didn't arrive till 10 minutes after the first dish so we weren't too impressed with the lack of coordination of dishes. We also had to get the attention of the wait staff a few times to ask for a second spoon for the dessert, milk for our tea and to enquire about the timing of arrival of my husbands dish. Overall, while the food was good, I wouldn't choose to return unless the service shows some improvement. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,french steak,positive,40,29-Apr-14,gave my bestie a birthday treat there and the steak and truffle fries were pretty tasty. the guy who served us was nice and attentive. Changed my seat to a better seats when available. Will return since is in town. I was at the pacific plaza branch.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Sorely Disappointed, Waste of Money",negative,20,22-Feb-15,"I had high hopes for this restaurant as they have one entree of steak and fries I expected it to be excellent..it wasn't. The steak is from a cheap cut and the sauce they serve it with has an overpowering taste of lemon, it was terrible.Only good thing were the fries which unfortunaye they refuse to serve with ketchup which i would have forgiven them for if the steak sauce was at least tasty!I will definitely not be returning!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,negative,30,1-May-17,Good service. Food selection was average. Sashimi quality wasn't very good. The cold Soba was tasteless.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Great food, even better chefs and service",positive,50,30-Dec-13,"This is my 4th time here and Shinji always upholds the very high standards it sets itself. I observe different and new things each time i come and always learn something about japanese and sushi culture, so this adds to the eating experience. This time, i noticed they have ice cubes on all their cutting areas and i learnt it's so that the fish doesn't dry up on the table while being cut and end up spoiltCrowded and packed at 12pm sharp, this place is very popular and rightfully soOpted for my usual 12 piece lunch again. This time, the pieces seem a little smaller than the last time i remembered them, but they also had different items this time. The usual maguro, chutoro, otoro were excellent as usual. The ebi and anago were also very good. My favorite uni was its usual generous portion so no complains. This time, they added a bowl of ikura. Not a sushi piece, but an entire bowl. For those liking it , like me, it's a treat. For those who don't, oh well. To be fair, they do ask what you like or don't like at the beginning. But i think you do need to know your japanese food before coming here, and this is like advanced class, not for beginners. A previous reviewer gave this place a very low rating because ""it doesn't serve steak"". So obviously, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Or sheService was excellent as usual throughout, the chefs and waitresses all know what they're doing. This was actually my friend's birthday lunch and i mentioned this while making the reservation. I didn't think about it after. Nearly the end of our meal, the lights of the entire restaurant dimmed and the 4 sushi chefs came out with funny hats, glasses and bowties and sang happy birthday, carrying out a ""cake"". it was surprising and hilarious at the same time. What a nice gestureThis place is expensive, but 1 of the few to be really worth the money. After all, they have to recoup the cost of their 1 piece 220 year old japanese cypress which make up the entire sushi counter"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Mediocre food with slow service and noisy environment,negative,20,22-Sep-16,We had a family lunch at this restaurant a few days ago. The service was slow and it was a pain getting the attention the service staff. The Hot and Sour Soup ordered tasted only of corn flour and the 2 'Panner' or Cottage Cheese North Indian dishes tasted and looked and same. The restaurant was noisy and unkept with dirty floors. I am not going back here for sure.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Experience the bar as a starter,positive,40,24-Sep-18,"I had planned to head to Gluttons Bay market for a chilli crab, only to be severely disappointed by the running of the Singapore Grand Prix and therefore unable to access it. I was aware that Marina Bay Sands nearby hosted some celebrity restaurants, and I had heard of Tetsuya's Waku Ghin, so changed my plans to go there. I wasn't particularly dressed for the occasion, however the staff greeted me with no difference, and I was promptly seated to access the bar menu (the degustation that day was $450, and a bit out of my budget). I had the most amazing umekomachi as a cocktail, then an exceptional beef tartare that was perfectly mixed with wasabi soy with fine egg topping, then a toro bowl where the fish was exceptional but the rice was a bit gluggy and underwhelming. Overall a very good experience."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Food! Quite High End,positive,50,1-Jun-15,"Food:

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Husband's birthday,positive,50,29-Jan-16,The staff were very very nice to have held our table. We had to revise our reservation from 7.30pm to 8pm and we were late because we had taken the bus to the wrong outlet. Staff were accommodating and v helpful. And we enjoyed our steak a lot. Will definitely recommend and return. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant hawker food court,positive,50,24-Apr-12,"A great experience and amazing food - too much choice. Catch the 196 bus to Newton Circle/Circus and have a feast - cold beer, cheap food, great choice and a lot of fun. A touch of ""old Singapore"", hawker-style."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch with Dim Sum at Yum Cha,positive,50,10/3/2015,"Head upstairs in the heart of Chinatown to probably the best Dim Sum house in Singapore. Full of character and served with traditional trolleys. The food is delicious and varied with a few items that you might not have seen elsewhere - such as the squid ink dumplings. The yam dumplings, Cheung Fun and Char Sui Bau are traditional favourites. It is hard to go wrong."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Quality of food has gone down,negative,20,05/30/17,"We (3 adults & 1 child) used to frequent this place in the past, but on our last visit, found that the quality of the food has gone down, presumably due to it being packed out at dinner time. Victim of its own success perhaps?Food:The dim sum quality is fine, but the fried rice is now of below average quality (fewer pricey ingredients such as prawns, just full of eggs, over-salted). The fried noodles with mushrooms were also of below average quality, with few mushrooms and nothing else other than soy sauce.Service: Too few waiting staff for the number of tables. One dish got lost in the order, and was served very late after our reminder.Would we go back again? Not in a hurry. Not at busy times."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian street food!,positive,50,20-Mar-16,"Kailash parbat is a regular for us (we are Indians) and a place where we take family visiting from home too - they never get disappointed by the authentic taste.The chaats and street corner food are the best. It being a Sindhi restaurant, would highly recommend trying Koki there (a type of bread which has spices and is fried). Bhatura and Pav Bhaji are excellent too.. With such good street food, I have tried eating the main course meals only once and decided to stick with the street food.For people with a sweet tooth, try the Jamun-e-Jannat (Hot gulab jamuns in cold rabri)We are regulars here and will keep on visiting. Prefer the Belilios Lane outlet to the one at Syed Alwi road"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"no frills, but good food",positive,40,06/15/14,"The seafood is very tasty and well priced. Service is courteous and prompt. However the setup is very low key - plastic chairs, no bib for covering the shirt etc. If you want tasty good definitely try this."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience not to be missed,positive,40,23-Mar-17,A wonderful experience with something like 50 or 60 different food outlets to choose from surrounding a central seating area. Incredibly busy when we were there at 9:00pm but well organised and remarkably clean with a great atmosphere.
French,Saveur,Risotto just the way I like it,positive,40,5-Aug-14,"I've come to Concetto twice for their mushroom risotto and have yet to find a risotto elsewhere that's to my liking as much as this place. At other restaurants, risotto if not done well can turn out soggy and bland but Concetto's version is perfectly al dente (is that the right term?) and wonderfully flavorful. Portions are not full-on American sized but I find that this way it leaves room to enjoy a starter and/or dessert. The deconstructed tiramisu is pretty awesome as well - although it did take us a few moments to adjust to the idea of not having a bowl or glass.Concetto is very popular, so it would be better if you made your reservation ahead of time so that you don't have to wait. Again, due to the popularity, you will feel rather 'hounded' - not by the waitstaff who are lovely and understanding, but by the many pairs of watching eyes of those waiting to be seated."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good Cantonese restaurant in a cozy atmosphere,positive,40,7/9/2014,"The restaurant is actually pretty small but it creates a cozy atmosphere and you ask for a table by a window, you'll get to enjoy a very nice view of the Singapore skyline. Overall, the food was really good and the service excellent. I highly recommend the wasabi prawns. The only trouble is actually how to find the entrance to the Marina Mandarin hotel from Marina Square Shopping Center!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",great sashimi and efficient service.,positive,50,28-Dec-15,"especially enjoyed the sashimi, both quality and quantity. sadly the all you can eat buffet did not provide drinks or dessert, not even simple ones, it would have been nicer. we still enjoyed hot green tea with an additional SGD $1. so not bad at all.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best avoidable indian restaurant in singapore,negative,20,18-May-13,"After coming back from India recently my taste buds were tickling for some good indian chatpatta food ... Looking at the lay out of the restaurant and what I heard about the restaurant in radio advertising ( Of course they are paid) ... I thought this is the place best suited to give me the same experience what I had in Delhi few days back however to my surprise the food is not at all good ... Not fresh... Oily ... Forget about the taste. Even the tea took almost 15 mins to come and was clearly not fresh as I could see the clotted layer on top, when I asked to the person serving the tea..... Is this Fresh ? His reply was yes the tea is fresh however it's just served late!!!!! The Ambiance is nice however to get repeat customers ambiance ONLY will not help. For the time being I am not returning back to this place hope they make some changes.Thanks "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","Nice place to enjoy vegetarian Indian dishes, especially dosa",negative,30,15-Dec-13,"Nice place in Little India to enjoy vegetarian Indian dishes, especially dosa. Chilli Idle or fried idli (small iddlies made like chilli gobi) is a great item; not to be missed"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, fun experience",positive,40,3-Dec-15,"This was a fun experience. To set the scene, the hawker stalls are basically in a circle, with an open air eating area in the centre. You walk in and start doing a lap to pick out what looks good. If you don't enjoy the hawker experience then avoid this place. There is a good range of food to choose from, including Singapore Chilli Crab. We got our Singapore Chilli Crab from Mrs Tan at stall 66, although I believe she normally works out of stall 72. We got some satay sticks from stall 74, and a cold beer to wash it down. I wouldn't call the food cheap, but it wasn't too expensive either. in fact, all things considered, the beer was relatively the most expensive thing there at $7 SD a glass. The food was quick and tasty. The meal was all the more enjoyable because the stall operator Mrs tan came over to chat with us. Do make sure you have plenty of napkins as the Singapore Crab is messy. Worth the visit for the experience. "

French,Saveur,A nice simple menu with delicious options,negative,30,3-Mar-14,Concetto opened up in the former Billy Bomber location at The Cathay. Went there last night for the first time and was pleased with our dinner. I was expecting the wait-staff to come by after serving the food to inquiry about our meals but they did not so that was disappointing. That will come once the front of house staff learns to pay attention to customers. My advice to anyone planning to eat there is to save room for dessert. We didn't and I regret that as the Tiramisu looked fabulous.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Food poisoning,negative,10,17-Dec-14,"Severe food poisoning after the Omakase Shin meal. We had dinner and around midnight, I felt that my stomach was very uncomfortable but didnt think much about it. Around 2am, I stared vomiting and this repeatedly went on throughout the night (vomited at least 5 times throughout the night and at least 7 in total including the next day)Reached out to Shinji to check into the cleanliness and was told that they uphold food hygiene to the highest standards and that stomachs react differently to a particular ingredient although they would still check on the menu. In the end, they came back and said that the chef looked into the menu and no other customers had any stomach upset. This was not our first time going to a fine dining Japanese restaurant and this has never happened. I have not even had food poisoning ever since I could rememberNot worth paying SGD600 per pax for food poisoning."

That said most of the food sold, (mainly seafood) is of good quality and flavour.Can be reached by MRT to Newton Circus just one stop from Orchard Road. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Possibly one of the nicest lohei I’ve had,positive,40,3/9/2018,"Invited to a business lunch for CNY and was impressed by the lohei ingredients, abalone/salmon/shrimps all in! The crispy silver bait fish was extremely tasty and refreshing strips of pear inside the lohei really made it my top fav of this cny must-have dish. Generally the food my host picked were all impressive, the braised pork belly, assam fish head.. except for the oxtail stone rice which I personally didn’t really enjoyed. Would probably try their tradition dim sum the next round. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",average food at high prices,negative,20,27-Nov-12,There are only a couple of stalls at the Newton Hawker centre that I would patronize....the Malay rice stall ( Nasi Padang ) and the Duck Noodle stall.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite tastes,positive,50,18-Jun-18,"From the minute you walk into the restaurant, you join a rarefied environment that makes you feel like you've left the world behind. If you're a previous customer, the staff knows what you've had previously and will present new menu items for your omakase dining. Yet some familiar favorites must be had - the Uni and botan shrimp with caviar is just heavenly. Definitely a place to impress the date but it's a going to cost a pretty penny."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore,positive,40,12-Apr-17,"Although designed as a tourist attraction as well as a residential / office worker hawker centre it is certainly worth an evening of any Singapore visitor's itinerary. Yes, it is more expensive than pretty much any other hawker centre in the city, but it is still cheap for what you get: Usually very good, quick food across multiple cuisines: Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Thai, Indian, with lots of fruit and juice (and beer) stalls. It is always lively with a good locals/tourist mix."
French,Saveur,Food wasnt fresh and poor service,negative,10,31-Jul-17,"We ordered the dinner menu. Firstly the duck in the duck salad wasnt fresh and there's a strong aftertaste after chewing on the duck. The salmon confit was slightly more fresh but the freshness is nothing compared to a salmon sashimi that you can find in a jap restaurant. My wife ordered the seabass and it didnt help to lift our mood in the restaurant. The dessert was the best dish for the evening. But it didnt help that for each course, we were serve a minimum of 5mins apart from each other. The dessert was a good 15mins apart, with my wife ordering a lava cake and myself a chocolate hazelnut. We understand this is a casual restaurant, we dun expect unforgettable food but at least just have the dishes serve almost together and not after 1 person has finish then u serve the other. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A little overrated?,negative,30,23-Dec-11,"I know this is one of “the” Hawker Centre’s in Singapore and, to be honest, I did use to really enjoy this place. It all depends on your expectations. It’s in a good location, and does serve pretty good local foods. A nice introduction to the Singapore Hawker experience.For tourists, it’s definitely one of the nicer looking centres in Singapore… leafy, open, green and secluded from the traffic. Plus the stone floor is attractive and, of course, very clean. But, the downside is that the choices are very limited. And, depending on your expectations, a little expensive.Most of the stalls specialize in seafood. I don’t particularly like seafood, which leaves with me one or two BBQ meat stalls. These are fine (and actually much cheaper than seafood), but you can get BBQ meats in almost every street corner in Singapore!So, like I said… it depends on your expectations. I still recommend this place to tourists, but don’t come here so much myself anymore.Tips: be forceful with the touts… if you really don’t want what they are offering (i.e. their table, their drinks, their food, their napkins etc…) just tell them. And please take a look at the signs giving advice on the pricing… those visual signs do a much better job of describing the correct “haggling process” than I could!"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Always Special to go back there - most expensive restaurant in the world ?,positive,40,5-Dec-15,"Located right at the Marina Bay Sands, where patrons usually don't think too much about value, or money . If you go at Wakughin, don't think either about value. Just accept the price - it will be a minimum of 750 Sing a head. You will be getting a great experience there, beautiful sake, beautiful wine, great food and an impeccable service. The odd bit was the bread ..which, despite beeing apparently baked in house, looked and tasted like a baguette made ifor Supermarkets ! Rest was excellent, wish the lobster stock/reduction would have been more flavorful - the concentration was un sufficient - the signature dish was of course , as usual the real winner . Not a three stars in my view. But a good two stars . "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious succulent roast duck!,positive,40,04/23/18,"This is the place to come for roast duck! Order your dishes by filling in the menu form and the staff will do the rest!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",worst hawker centre in Singapore,negative,10,12-Jul-14,"Really dislike this hawker center. One visit was enough for me, I won’t give it a second chance. There are so many amazingly wonderful hawker centers in Singapore, why anyone goes to Newton Circus is beyond my comprehension. You get accosted with pesky hagglers the second you arrive, the tables have warnings about not ordering from the individuals haggling you but to order directly at the stall instead. This sort of says it all. Newton Circus is a generally unpleasant place because of these people. Lau Pa Sat satay evenings has a slight bit of this same scene but they leave you alone after one attempt, and the overall vibe is enjoyable and hectic and manageable. At Newton Circus, there is nothing enjoyable at all about the persistent hecklers who are there, it feels like, to exploit the tourist element. As to the quality of the food, I can’t even comment because I couldn’t wait to leave. Thankfully I have tons of other fantastic choices for hawker food, I am not missing anything by opting out of this one."

And well cooked steaks to order, both cuts explained by the waitress. Service was attentive as we'd come to expect from a previous visit or two. We started on the terrace this time to enjoy the sights of the street. Before mains we asked to move inside because a bar nearby decided to go heavy metal at 7.30pm. Despite the restaurant being near full, this was handled seamlessly. Glad we got to experience the ambience inside. Lovely. A well run, well respected restaurant. "

Special thanks to Bowie, Alden and Vivian for their efforts in coordinating pre-wedding plans, including designing a sumptuous menu for our occasion, making it an unforgettable experience for all our guests. Always felt so much hospitality whenever we are back at the place for a meal. Strongly recommend this place if you are looking for fine-dining with a personal touch at a Chinese Restaurant.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An experience,positive,40,14-Dec-16,"It was a treat to dine at Waku Ghin given its rave reviews and the overall experience was memorable. The quality of the food and produce was first rate- lobster, sea urchin, caviar, wagyu and abalone. The best dish was undoubtedly the botan shrimp with caviar- a unique creation bursting with umami and very refreshing. The abalone however didn't quite cut it, tasting rather bland and falling short in texture. I very much preferred the accompaniment to the abalone as opposed to the abalone itself. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth checking out. On another note, it was a pleasure meeting with Chef Tetsuya at Savour. One of the humblest and nicest chefs I'ce met despite his fame. "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Memorable Dinner at Peach Blossoms,positive,50,03/14/17,"Wanted to bring my parents and elderly relatives for a good Chinese dinner and Peach Blossoms was undoubtedly my #1 choice. As usual, we left delighted after yet another highly satisfying meal that had everyone beaming from ear to ear.The ongoing Peking duck promotion was excellent value for money, especially when you take into account how succulent the duck was compared to many of its competitor's offerings. The other dishes were equally scrumptious and divine as well and spoke volumes about the restaurant's pride in their craft. The quality that distiguishes Peach Blossoms from the rest must be the superb service of its staff led by restaurant manager Alden. Alden's warm and personable style ensured that everyone had a comfortable evening of laughter paired with the thoughtful food recommendations he made.Thanks to his trusted suggestions, our entire dining party (both young and old) got to enjoy a delectable mix of dishes that catered to all our tastebuds.Another memorable evening! Thank you Alden and Peach Blossoms!"
French,Saveur,"Decent overall, but service staff could do with more training",negative,30,10-Jul-16,"Quality of food is good, but knowing that it's part of the Saveur group, we had expectations of better initiative from service staff, who obviously were either very inexperienced or part-timers. Otherwise, it was a rather delightful dinner (in spite of the squishy table arrangements)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Touristy, but probably worth it for the experience",negative,30,28-Feb-13,"I am old enough to remember the good old days in Singapore when mobile food stalls were wheeled into places at night and set up in a hive of activity to provide a range of good quality, cheap and delicious varieties of dishes that you could watch being cooked, and virtually without tourists so you got the real deal at rock bottom prices. The one at the Cold Store Car Park off Orchard Road was my favourite (if anybody can remember that far back!). Alas such itinerant food stalls no longer exist, all being now confined (on the grounds of hygiene) to a permanent stalls at fixed locations such as the Newton Hawker Centre– this being one of the largest. Oh well, all good things change over time, but I have to say that it is not as good as the old transient stalls.Having said that it is an interesting experience for the uninitiated, although it has become too touristy and not as good as some other, less tourist-orientated food centres – much better food can be had in Chinatown. Nevertheless, if you want to go for the experience then there are some good dishes to be found, although they do vary. My advice would be to walk around firstly to decide what you want, ignoring the blandishments of the stall owners who try to entice you to sit at their table. Probably 75-80% offer the same things, but some offer different or specialist dishes. Also, remember you don’t have to eat everything from the same stall, as if you fancy something from another stall then order it and they will bring it to you – but do ensure you make it clear to them where you are sitting (and best not to pick something from too far away, although if you don’t pay for it until it’s delivered they will find you!). If you want to eat all dishes at the same time, then ensure you get the timing of your order right if ordering from different stalls (order from the furthest stall first)It’s also worth noting that the Newton Centre is not particularly convenient for walking or public transport, and although taxis are cheap and easy to find to take you there early on, they are not so easy to get to go home later in the evening as most that turn up have been pre-booked. It is possible to flag one down on the adjacent main road, but you may have to wait a while before a free one passes, so you might consider ordering a taxi in advance to take you home and avoid much frustrating waving at taxis when all you want is to return to your hotel room!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,We were underwhelmed,negative,30,01/25/18,"We ate here as a part of a tour, so had a set menu, which may explain our rating. Other diners appeared to be enjoying their food more than we did. The set menu had the usual suspects: a soup, a chicken with sauce dish, a fish with vegies and sauce, pork fried rice, a broccoli dish, and a mango pudding for dessert. The food was not bad, just uninspired, as was the service. I would hope that one could do better in Chinatown in Singapore."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great place to taste local food ,positive,50,14-Mar-17,"This is a must-visit hawker center in Singapore. It's relatively cleaner than many other non-air conditioned hawker centers I have visited. To name a few, my favourites are the salad wrap facing carpark, fishballs/fish dumplings from the left (inside) corner stall and satays from Heng ?.There are many stalls selling BBQ seafood too, but be very careful when ordering crab, fish, lobsters and prawns/shrimps because these are usually charged by weight. It's recommended to find out the costs before ordering.By the way, most food here are served in disposable cutlery and utensils."

I nudged a waiter who was passing by and said that I had ordered a hot chocolate and a croissant. Soon enough my hot chocolate arrived. I waited another half an hour and asked the same waiter again and he said my croissant was on the way. Another 15 mins went by and it was well past 4.30 pm and I could wait no longer.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak & Fries; that's it,positive,40,26-May-13,"This is a steak and fries resto and they offer nothing else. So you must like steak to come here. The staff, most especially the Westerners, can get snooty. They do not accept reservations except for big groups. We once booked a big table for 10 and they wouldn't let us sit down, even if they already reserved our table for us. We were about 6 already and the snooty Westerner waiter wouldn't let us sit. What's the point??? They already reserved our table and our companions were 10 minutes away. Plus we were celebrating 3 birthdays. They could be more flexible and service oriented in this sense. But I doubt they would care, because a lot of people go there. But there are better places to go to in the area, so they'd better improve.In addition, the place is TINY, and the tables are sooo close to each other so you really have no privacy. In fact, it's sooo cramped that they have to pull out the table to let you sit on the cushioned seats near the wall. Yes, that small."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The Pani poori fix..!!!,positive,40,12-Nov-16,"We went to this place one evening as the taste buds started tingling upon seeing Kailash Parbat. Ordered for Pani poori and some more stuff from the chat family.Well, not as great as the ones you might get in Mumbai, but the quality was good, considering you are in Singapore. Decent place. Bang opposite Mustafa, near gate 3."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth the money,positive,50,19-Sep-18,I had lunch with my colleague at the restaurant.We both ordered Chef Omakaze(don’t remember exactly but it was one of thier Omakaze).Their quality level of the foods are excellent and matter of fact it was too much food for me!We had some beers and highballs. Eventually we paid slightly over 1k Singapore dollar as total.They are expensive but worth the money.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,negative,10,20-Jan-12,"This is very close to home, but we actually try and suggest to friends not to go there. They are expensive, the Hawkers is not as good as the many others around town - this is an example where they have gained a good reputation through word of mouth or travel books and they don't deserve. If you do decide to go, make sure they don't rip you off on price."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh! Lots of Choices,positive,50,09/27/11,"Really, really enjoyed the food! All was fresh and excellent and we had quite a variety of dishes. Mostly seafood. Drink service was attentive. Food delivered to table as it became ready, a little dis-orienting for people used to typical US service (appetizers then entree). This was the best tasting, best quality food I had while I was in Singapore."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, kitchen staff are amazing!",positive,40,30-Dec-16,"Think as we ate throughout the buffet, being seated at the chef's counter, we got to witness the flurry that the chefs experienced as orders furiously and continously flooded the kitchen. We were amazed at how the chefs worked under such intense speed and pressure, and honestly this is a clear indication that as diners, we need to learn to be patient and wait rather than assume that this is a buffet line and expect our food to come continuously and non-stop. The quality of the food was great, as usual, the staff were helpful (most of them) and offered great service. Had a pleasant experience dining here, not my first time and will definitely not be my last either (: "
French,Paul,Opens for breakfast yet no typical breakfast items available!,negative,30,17-Aug-13,"Paul a French patisserie opens for breakfast at 9am (different to whats advertised) and has an extensive section in their menu of different drinks with a breakfast item. This item includes a croissant or a pain de chocolate, typical for a French breakfast and what's on offer at Paul's. Yet it's not ready and this isn't the first time it - happens consistently that these items as stated on their menu are not ready. The staff then offer you to go to the counter to choose something else all more of the cake variety, morning or afternoon tea or sandwiches. For a European like myself I come here to have a European breakfast after all that's what they are selling, so don't bother - go somewhere else, as it wasn't just me complaining the table next to me too (a French native) as well, therefore this must be consistent service down falls. The staff just look and apologise not sure what they are trying to achieve with this! At 930 I asked again if they are ready, was told another 15 minutes! So apart from breakfast, their breads and pastries are nice, fresh and in season. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great food & exceptional services,positive,50,05/14/17,"Managed to find this restaurant from Tripadvisor after reading those favorable comments. Decided to try out with relatives to celebrate birthday & Mother's Day for dinner . It was indeed a good choice. Food was delicious & tasty but what really surprises us was the level of service extended by the staff to make our meal an unforgettable experience. They were exceptionally courteous & friendly plus went that extra mile with trimmings, complimentary birthday desserts & takeaway mother's day & birthday gifts. Special mention goes to the two ladies staff who served us by the name of Christine and Mun Fong plus their other colleagues Alvin, Terry, Bowie, Sook Teng, Hui Hoon, Sun Jing & Akira. I have been to many restaurants that serves good food but this is one of the very few restaurants that the staff really go all out to delight their customers. Will definitely come again. Hope they will maintain the high quality service "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",average high end sushi at premium price,negative,30,24-Oct-13,"It was a nice place with rather good sushi in omakase style. Service was tremendously good. However, SGD260 without any alcohol and it was just the cheapest set, this must be a joke. There is surely something wrong with the pricing mechanism. Anyway, putting that aside, Shinji by Kanesaka is a fine sushi place. But do not expect something world class like in Japan as you won't get the fish as good when it has to fly all the way from Japan."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touts are still bad news,negative,20,27-Mar-12,"We are locals so we were careful not to be fleeced. But the American guy sitting at the next table was not so lucky. We overheard him questioning the stall helper about his $72 bill for five prawns. Granted, these were big prawns, but $72??? The food is nothing to shout about either. Go only when you're in the vicinity and hungry. Definitely not worth going out of your way to visit this. Lots of better, cheaper and more authentic hawker food in many other places in Singapore. "

Chinese,Crystal Jade,WestGate outlet staff chasing diner to finish meal,negative,10,3/1/2014,Poor service and staff keep asking to clear table even my daughter is eating and there are still food in the dishes. It is even more frustrating that a staff told us off that others are waiting !!We are only there for about an hour and the waiting time for food is longer than we enjoy it. The total bill for this dinner is sgd170 for 3 of us and we expect some minimum respect as a customer of Crystal Jade
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Overrated, Overpriced !",negative,10,24-Jun-13,"Kailash Parbat is highly overrated for the service, ambiance and most importantly the food it serves.Located in the heart of Little India with a finely lit up ambiance, it is sure to grab attention of on-goers (both Indian and others). It did grab our attention too for the first time I went there with my friends.Upon entering the noisy food-court like environment was a sure turn-off. I pulled my iphone to check on the decibel levels in the restaurant and no wonder it wasn’t me but it was really noisy (110 db). But looking at the number of people, it did give a sense of confidence about the place and I decided to not judge the place simply by its ambiance or comfort to my eyes/ears. We walked towards our table for 4 and we were seated in what looked like a place for not more than 2 adults. Maybe 4 kids weighing 30 kg each is what they made the table for. We successfully pushed ourselves in through the cramped up table and ordered our food. So far I was still giving the place, a second and now a third chance, banking highly on the food they will serve. After all, restaurants are meant to serve food. Other things are add-ons.After a not-so-long wait, our orders were on our table: few starters of Paneer (cottage cheese), Pani-puri, few drinks (around SG $5 for a lime juice!!). The first few bites of food added to the severe wounds of ambiance, seating and service. There is no way there will ever be another chance if the restaurant fails at its food.Pani-poori was broken and it did not hold the masala/paanis (syrups). Other chats either were tasteless or excessively spicy. Paneer was half cooked and hastily massaged with a layer of masala/garnishing. There was nothing to complain about the roti (bread), but that’s no rocket science for any restaurant. The core strength of this place as claimed is their Chat (snacks) , which was nowhere close to being even half good as what we get at any Indian restaurant.To my surprise every time I went there with an open mind to accept the place and see if anything has changed, I returned with disappointment. I made around 4 visits and now I am writing this review.The final blow was the bill which looked like injustice to what we just experienced. Overpriced!In summary: The place is a lit up version of a food court experience with food half as good as what you get in food courts, as noisy as it is in food courts and you pay three to four times of what you will otherwise spend. Food quality depicts the haste of serving you and pushing you out of the restaurant to get the next in line seated.Maybe a few non-indians may even get close to liking this place. I wont blame them, its just Indian food for them and nothing to compare against.My verdict – avoid ! Save your ears, eyes, tongue and hey, your wallet too."
French,Saveur,Underwhelming,negative,30,13-Dec-16,"Not sure if the general Saveur quality has dropped just this outlet. We had the Saveur pasta which was cold, and they ran out of a few items because of a problem with the truffle oil. This made the used-to-be amazing mash potatoes served with the duck confit disappointing. Got the milk & cookies dessert, which was a fun dessert but portion was just too small for $9.9. We also tried to use the Chope voucher, but I would not recommend it to anyone because it is just too restrictive, being invalid on public hols and the eve, and only valid for ala-carte items. They wouldnt even freaking top-up of $4.5 for the ILT and soup, and you can also forget about the daily promotions."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best dinning experience ,positive,50,1-Apr-16,"By far the best dinning experience ever! We reluctantly passed through Singapore on our way to the Maldives (now we wish we'd stayed longer). Back to Waku Ghin... we enjoyed a private dining experience, with our own chef who cooked approx a dozen tasting dishes in front of us throughout the night. Each dish was presented impeccably and tasted even better then they looked! From the hand crafted ice dome in my husband's scotch, to the fresh ingredients used through out, this was an experience of a life time. The staff were extremely professional and our chef was wonderfully polite, we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with him through out the night. For dessert we were moved to a large open dinning room, with views spanning across the bay, allowing us to enjoy the 'Wonder Full' light and laser show in seclusion. As we left, the chef basically chased us out of the restaurant to personally say goodbye. The evening cost us approx $1,300 (AUD) for the two of us but in my opinion it was worth every cent. Not every dining experience here would cost the same, however we did enjoy some great wine & scotch with our food. Despite Singapore exceeding all our expectations, I've said many times that I would go back to Singapore just to eat here again, so much so, we are planning a trip next month! I can't wait!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Place for Brunch (dim sum)!,positive,40,1/9/2015,Long queue but worth it. Good place with great taste for dim sum. Fast service/serving. Will be back again when visit SG.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, awful service",negative,30,15-Jan-16,"The chaats are delicious - the three of us had three chaats which was one too many but the waiter was totally unhelpful with advice on the right quantities for three people. The Hyderabad biryani and curd rice were very good too, as was the dhal and bendi. But why did we feel so rushed? They kept coming to clear the dishes, kept asking if we were done and then brought the bill before we had even asked for it! Noisy. Stressful. Not returning anytime soon, but they probably won't notice. "
French,Saveur,Nice duck confit!,positive,40,19-Jan-18,"I tried the duck confit, which was the signature dish. The meat is soft and tender, and the sauce is nice. Comes with a generous serving of delish mash potato. Worth a try!"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown food,positive,40,01/28/17,"Shaky staircase leads into a bustling restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Carts in the room, laden with baskets pork ribs with sweet potatoes, yams and samami dim sum with shrimp and spinach make an impression even on those who are Asia - a sweet home."
French,Angelina_MBS,underwhelming,negative,20,31-Jul-16,The coffee was ok (if you like brewed coffee) and the service was good. But this place is somewhat sad as the entire mall does not see many customers. The cakes are way too sweet and not freshly baked (they said they import them from France...). But the biggest drawback is the price. Why would anyone pay these sort of prices for a piece of cake?
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Thinly sliced moon cake as ""pickles"" in my tab",negative,20,9/11/2016,"This being the moon cake festival in singapore, when a small dish of 4 thinly sliced moon cakes were served we thought it was for tasting so we could buy them home when our meal ends. At checkout we were told these were ""pickles"" and chargeable at $3. I requested for the bill to be retabulated since we were not told the cost beforehand. A rather non-transparent bit of marketing here, i wld say. Although they acceded to my request, this left a tinge of a bad taste to an otherwise juicy and fatty duck rice I had. Check your ""pickles"" when you come here. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,positive,40,7-Feb-17,Had a pleasant experience here celebrating my wife's birthday.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice and cheap. Taste wise quite ok,negative,30,11/6/2016,The food is not bad. The price is cheap and with Safra card you get 30% off on weekday evening. The place is average but it's on 2nd level but the elevator is faulty.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food.,positive,50,20-Nov-16,"The food was great and worth it. Love the platter of sashimi. They were very fresh. Aside from having wrong or missing food orders due to lack of staff, my family and I enjoy the restaurant overall."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisitely good,positive,50,25-Mar-15,"My husband and I celebrated our birthdays together, we were brought there by our son and daughter-in-law. Sitting at the counter we were served the freshest and exquisitely prepared pieces of fish and seafood. The chef singlely, devotedly delivered his creations to his guests and clearly explained from which part of Japan they came from. We are quite amazed that they come from almost every far corners of the country. Tell him your likes and he will offer that extra portion of otoro. It was not inexpensive, the lunch omakase was $250 per person. The meal ended magically when all lights went off and 3 clown-faces popped out to sing happy birthday! What a lovely surprise."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian restaurant ,positive,50,4-Dec-16,My husband was worried because he doesn't believe a meal can be a meal if it has no meat. We did not realise it was vegetarian until we sat down. With the help of the waiter we ordered our meals and were pleasantly surprised with some of the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The restaurant also looked a lot more modern than surrounding restaurants in little India. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive and Overrated - Benihana on Steroids,negative,30,8-Aug-14,"Well.... for the 7th best restaurant in the world, it was a disappointment. The service was amazing and at the same time lacking. You sit at a high hibachi table identical to Benihana. Only 3 courses are prepared in front of you, the other 7 or 8 are served from the kitchen. Your seafood is presented to you at the beginning of the meal and some still alive, which is fine.After the presentation it was hard to talk across all 5 us laterally. If were less than 5 then another 2 people would have been seated with us and would have had to join the family conversation.After dinner you are moved to the back room for desert, which is actually to open the table for the next sitting. For the price paid $400 per person plus 7% Marina Bay Sands service charge plus GST plus 10% tip plus drinks or wine it becomes a truly large bill. The Wagyu Beef and Lobster Braised was excellent, the other courses were ok but not a wow.It just comes across as a Las Vegas style, very expensive hotel restaurant. I would not go back and would recommend other Singapore eateries especially for what they charge and what you get for that price."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Don't take the kids!...,positive,50,6-Sep-17,"The decor here is Tokyo authentic and the fish direct from the Tokyo fish market (literally). As you could expect the Sushi is unbelievable!!However, with a $200, $300 or $500 price per head, it's not a cheap nite out.The only goods news is that the wine is quite affordable (by comparison).Loved it tho. And I'm going back for the $500 meal (but won't take the kids)."

Service was good and friendly. The dishes were very large and may be reduced in size. We were not able to have dessert because of the size of starter and main.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Quite an exclusive Chinese setting with suiting ambience ,positive,40,8/6/2017,Wonderful Chinese fine dining with assurance of freshness and skilful cooking. The starter was great with a good mixture of cold dish. The Peking duck was well prepared. The service staff are friendly and efficient. Just felt sad to notice that the Shark Fin soup are still on the menu of this relatively well known Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Maybe the management could be more conscious of the rampant killing of the sharks.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher - Lunch Buffet,negative,20,20-Sep-18,"Went to Shin Minori (UE Square branch) due to the countless advertisements from google and videos. Checked out the price and realized that it is actually really really pricey for a buffet - could get one at the same price for 2 when this is meant for 1 pax - so obviously i was expecting to be of quality because of the value for one. The restaurant looked good and the ambiance was really good for something pretty classy, however, as what i expected was a buffet, it felt kinda weird (since everyone is used to the crowded, noisy, etc).Food has to be ordered through the ipad (which crashed couple times, lol), with not many many varieties for the buffet. and the buffet did not even have free drinks or desert for the price - was shocked as well as pretty taken aback. The food quality was pretty average, and the food serving was very slow - mostly waiting for >30 minutes per item other than the sashimi (cause it should be premade). There was quite many items which was ordered but not served as well. The people who were working at the branch i was in was not very enthusiastic and was not eager to help at all, all of them had a really unhappy look on their face and i naturally did not feel very welcome as well. Just as the buffet was coming to a close, the owner(i presume) - came in and told the chefs to prepare some food (which was the same as we ordered) for a shoot (more advertisements i guess) - and sadly, the presentation of those food was of a completely different standard. Firstly, i did not expect this kind of service or food quality for something of such a high value. And this really isn't going to be compensated with the ambiance of the location. Frankly, i felt that i've wasted my money there and that i could have easily spent the money on something more worth it.This was an utter disappointment. "

He whipped up his culinary skills, slicing all the fresh produce pretty skillfully. very patiently explaining to us what the dishes were when served to us. Loved the servings as there were bite size and oh, the food were so fresh! We had a good 22 kinds of food, including the dessert, which was the sweet melon & mango, with sake. awesome dishes!Understand from my friend that she has to book in advance for the slot..

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha worst ever experience,negative,10,07/14/18,"I think a lot of customers will regret coming to this restaurant like myself and my family. The food is average and the service is extremely bad, especially when taking away the leftovers, they will lump everything into one box of different varieties like junk. When approach the stuff, they responded with very bad attitude and forcing us to accept their insincere apology. BE CAREFUL of coming to this place."
French,Paul,Not even close to any Paul in France,negative,20,8-Sep-14,"Forget the real Paul in France. Since here you'll find only the same name on the door, nothing else.Pricey place inside the famous Takashimaya shopping mall. Service quite rude, no smiles at all and food not well presented, especially when you pay 9 SGD for a slice of cake you don't expect a broken piece thrown on a plate. When you pay 17 SGD for ONE coffee and ONE slice of cake you'd like something more.Wasted money."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Lunch,positive,50,11/26/17,"Had a birthday celebration with my grandpa & relatives at peach blossoms marina mandarin. What an experience! Food is good. Service is excellent. Sook Teng took great care of us, ever look out to our needs. Terry did a great flour sculpting job as a gift to my grandpa. Tks for the wonderful memories!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Sea Food Restaurant - Recommend the set menus!,positive,50,10/15/10,"I was in Singapore hosting some customers and was recommended this place as a good place to take them. That was a great recommendation. This place is great!Since we had a group of 10 people I booked a table and ordered a set menu in advance (lucky we did too, as people were queuing to get in). Our menu included Bamboo Clams, Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roasted Chicken, Fish (not sure what type), Tofu, Noodles, Fruit (and perhaps something else) and it worked out at about S$80 a head (including quite a few beers - buy the big tiger draughts). I think that was a bargain. The food was great, especially the black pepper crab. The atmosphere is really nice, and eating there in a group is actually a lot of fun with the rotating table. My one criticism was that service got slower as the night went on. But to be honest we were having a nice time so it wasn't a big problem. I thoroughly recommend this place, and next time I am in Singapore I will check out one of the other branches of Long Beach."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive tourist trap,negative,20,30-Dec-16,"Food quality is really quite poor : stingray was old & smelly , sambal was straight out of a bottle ; vegetables were old & woody ; satay was mediocre etc etc Very very expensive Far better places to eat in Singapore than this tourist trap"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Average,negative,30,12/20/16,"Average dimsum restaurant. The only dish i would recommend is Signature black pepper london duck bun. The London roast duck rice was also average too. For dessert, the mango puree with sago is good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori,negative,30,26-Jun-16,"The only reason Shin Minori stands out is because of the bang for the buck! Their a la carté buffet is what makes it so special, at only 30-40 Singapore dollars per person. It's absolutely incredible for those who'd just love to stuff themselves up after weeks of sushi cravings! Service wasn't bad for a busy place, food definitely wasn't the best but it's just past satisfying! For a low budget sushi craze, this is exactly what you're looking for."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing,positive,50,20-Nov-15,"We had dinner at Shinji at Raffles Hotel a couple of weeks back, and it was nothing short of amazing. The sashimi was so fresh, especially the uni, it took us right back to Endo Sushi at the Osaka Fish Market. Dishes that came with sauces were delicately and thoughtfully put together and tasted absolutely heavenly. We had some sake to go with it, and that was delicious too. Finally, the seasonal fruits (and ice cream) that they served at the end of dinner were also of the finest quality. All in all, a gastronomically pleasurable experience.Service was of course, impeccable. We also appreciated how game the chefs were to dress up as they brought out the fruit platter, complete with candles, and sang happy birthday to just about all of us (just happened that 5 of the 6 couples at dinner that night were either celebrating an anniversary or a birthday). We would love to return again and share this experience with our friends and loved ones."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Always excellent value for money,positive,40,05/27/14,"In the middle of Chinatown Singapore, up an old staircase is still one of the best Yum Cha/dim sum restaurants in town. I have no hesitation in taking visitors here and going there myself for my favourites. In a town where prices are going through the roof, this is great value for money. Nice mix of shoppers, tourists and locals."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food..,positive,40,31-May-14,"Some Singaporean friends warned me that is is a tourist attraction and may be a tourist trap, but I went to try it anyway. Read some reviews from TA that booth no A1 is an honest vendor, and tried Fried Rice from A1. Huge portion of fried rice (medium size) S$ 8, and I just managed to ate 1/2, took the rest away. I guess small portion (S$ 5) should be enough.Tried Omellete Oyster from other booth but this this tasted so-so, as the oyster is still 'wet' and felt slightly undercooked. Didn't manage to try Ah-Heng carrot cake as it was closed. There were some touts, but you can just say no politely and they were not pushy. Go to this place if you want to try many varieties of Singapore food, the price is fair as many starts from S$ 5."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lovely veg food,positive,50,14-Oct-17,"Nice Indian food, amazing taste. Chole bhature is one of the best. Sweets are also good including rasmalai, faluda kulfi, rabri gulabjamun. Nice service. Little bit on higher side w.r.t price"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good place to eat South Indian food,negative,30,8-Oct-16,"Murugan idli shop is very affordably priced and also has very tasty food.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent quality of shashimi,positive,50,28-Jun-17,"Lots of variety of Japanese food, ordered through a tablet. Shashimi was delicious, and there's a wide range of Japanese food. Tepanyaki take quite long to come, as there is clearly a shortage of staff."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere and serves food until late!,positive,40,6-Nov-15,"We were really impressed having visited many hawker centres which closed early however this was open really late!Normal priced hawker food, various standard types - Indian, Malay, chicken rice (!). Normal priced beer for a hawker centre, around $6.Only thing that means it isn't a 5* rating is the people in the middle of the hawker centre who hawk and try to get you to buy food from certain stalls and pressure you into buying beer from them. Annoying and off putting.Aside from that, was great!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive well executed formula,positive,40,17-Mar-15,"Excellent quality of interesting sushi, as one would expect from suh a high end restaurant. Wife and I have been sevedral time never really spnding less than SGD1,000 for the meal admittedl with nice bottle of sake at dinner.Every thing Japanese, chefs and most of staff when we there (dont' know how foreign employee controls impact them). Not much to gripe if on can afford to eat at this restaurant apart from a strange sterile experience after the first time. Don't get me wrong - consistent excellent execution is a sign of top knotch quality - perhaps a little too formulaic.So perhaps, in conclusion, a must try but don't go too often even if you can afford it :)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good selection of food choices for buffet,positive,40,21-May-17,"Good for sashimi lovers who go for the buffet, good range of choices for the buffet. Would be perfect if certain dessert and green tea included in the buffet menu."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Flavours away from Home.,negative,30,23-Jun-13,"Awesome food - was homesick on my singapore trip with respect to Indian food. Kailash Parbat tickled my taste buds like never before. The chats reminded us of the Kailash Parbat we visit back home in Colaba, Mumbai. The glitch was that it was understaffed, hence servicr was a tad slow - the chef had to bring out the dishes on a few occasions. Management needs to work on the same."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to eat fresh and delicious seafood in Singapore ,positive,50,6/1/2017," The place is unique in a very nice area in Singapore.When visiting Singapore I always eat there. Food is consistently great. Seafood is always fresh from the tanks in the restaurant - in case wanted, you can feel and touch the food prior to cooking.Place is due to it's performance always full - so I highly recommended to book a table in advance"

French,Saveur,Affordable,positive,40,28-Apr-16,"Food selection was not wide. However, the prices were very affordable considering how they are situated in town. Ambiance was less than satisfactory because of the noise and crowd. However, the duck confit was a winner. The foie gras was, however, disappointing. So is the Seafood Bisque. Garden Salad and Escargots were average. The Saveur Pasta (appetizer) was delicious! "

The dim sum is very good the Xiaolongba are very tasty, as the is the deep fried banana and red bean and the mango pudding. Service is a bit slow though, but we think its worth it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hands down my most favourite hawker in Singapore!,positive,50,13-Apr-18,"Luckily my friend lives a 5 minute walk from here, so I was able to visit MANY times on my most recent trip to Singapore. There’s is not one particular stall I can recommend... just try as many as you possibly can! I used to obsess over the sambal stingray, the chilli crab (a fraction of the price you will pay at Boat Quay, and wayyyyyy tastier!) the grilled prawns, cockles, cereal prawn... amazing!!! But now I’ve gone a bit veggie/veganish, I’m now obsessed with all the amazing veggie dishes! Baby Kai lan, Sambal kangkong - the spicy green stringy one (you’ll know when you see it) veggie fried rice and noodles. Veggie Thai food, tom yum, salad, to name a couple. Roti prata and dal or veggie curries. Fresh coconut water. Omg the list just goes on!!! If you are in singapore VISIT VISIT VISIT!!! I didn’t see the lady with the beehive hair this time, but for the seafood eaters, look out for her, they do the BEST sambal stingray :) "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and plentiful,positive,40,21-Nov-13,This hawker centre was close to our hotel and had been recommended by an expat friend. We found out from local colleagues that it tends to get better reviews from expats than locals who don't think it's as good as other hawker centres in Singapore. For us it was convenient but also had great seafood dishes that were very reasonably priced. It was clean and had a really vibrant atmosphere. It's also open until late at night - some stalls stay open 24/7. Worth a visit.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,positive,50,11-Feb-18,Food was very yummy and ambience was nice for chats. Service staff were very friendly and prompt in serving up food.

First of all the staff not respond and said check the website for any details. When i asked i had a bad experience last time but i hope this was just accidental so want to order again, the staff rudely ANSWER , THEN PLS DONT COME. Same happend in August when i thorw a party at KP and it was full of mismanagement. Foods was not served and most of the time many dishes not available and i was busy to greet my friends. I thought it was just bcoz of 1 staff member but now i KNOW whole KP staff is rude and no customer respect. FOOD IS LIKE NOT WORTHY AS THE PRICE ON TOP OF IT THE TERRIBLE STAFF."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood,positive,40,02/28/16,"The seafood is still good as before. I personally still enjoy the chill crab, still creamy and go very well dipping it with bread. If you want it spicy, you will be disappointed as it is not spicy. But the black pepper crab are more spicy than the chilli crab. The Thai style squid are chewy and with the Thai chilli sauce on it are not over power and the cabbage goes along well too. The bamboo clam cook with the garlic are well cook too.Average price if you want Crab, Prawn, Fish and squid are between S$60-90/person"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The Best Restaurant in Singapore ,positive,50,27-Aug-16,Food is just out of this world. Thoughtful and skilful use of condiments and garnishes to bring out the flavours in the freshest ingredients - makes you realise great food is just that simple. Impeccable service and one of the widest selection of sake just adds on to the whole wonderful dining experience. Definitely worth more than the one star it's been given by Michelin.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Great Dinner,positive,40,17-Feb-18,Restaurant its really good very beautiful location nut its too crowded since they cater for big indian groups so the food quality is really nice but only thing is too crowded so its great for family and couple as well

The master chef Oshino San attended to us and what an experience it was. The fish was excellent, meticulously prepared and beautifully presented. The timing of the meal was perfect. The other small dishes and the sake we were recommended were an excellent complement to the meal. We got a little insight into the seasonal fish as we bantered happily with the chef. It was not cheap but then an excellent sushi meal usually is not.The whole experience left us feeling very happy and satisfied."

It took me straight back to my many visits to Paris. From the delicious hot chocolate to the decadent pastries.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food passable only,negative,20,18-Jul-16,"When I first entered the restaurant the female assistant manager didn't ask for my reservation but asked the guy behind me instead. When I flag out she was quite rude and said ""so what is your phone number ?"" That was bad attitude like I owe her. Food was ok but not great. Sashimi and sushi were quick but the rest like Gyoza and yakitori were really slow. I strongly recommend The Japanese buffet restaurant at Hotel Royal - much better quality. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian restaurant,positive,40,4-Jan-18,"It was awesome experience to eat indian veg food in singapore.Went for dinner and had pani poori, bhel poori chaat items.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent,positive,50,21-Mar-14,"In Singapore, this is the best I've tried so far. The sushi is really fresh and you can taste the difference in quality here. I enjoyed every single dish. But that's not all, there are little things I observed here that I think really makes this place stand out. For example, I am left-handed but I did not tell anyone at the restaurant that I was. Nevertheless, the chef must have noticed when I picked up my cup or adjusted my chopsticks, because all the sushi he served me was at the exact opposite angle of those served to other patrons, simply because this makes it easier for a left-handed to pick it up. The waiters also caught on to this later and any item they placed on the table was adjusted from right to left."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Wanna try South Indian food, try here!!",positive,50,11-Dec-14,"This place is famed for Idlis and Jigardhandas.

Overall the menu is good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Food!,positive,40,04/19/16,"Booked a private room as it was night out with colleagues. First time here, and I was very impressed with the quality of food. I would suggest booking a table outdoors if you enjoy the tropical weather.Try the Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Lobster salad!Downside though, the service was sort of disoriented as the dishes that were supposed to be appetizers came out late while the crabs came first. We were a group of 15 though, so I am not sure if it is the usual occurrence or a fluke. Nonetheless, the food was definitely worth it."

French,Angelina_MBS,Cheapest set lunch in town,negative,30,24-May-17,"Considering the rest of its menu, the $13.90 three course set lunch is really cheap. However, the portions are small, but you do get to taste its signature chocolate drink. Tried four of its pastries, including the signature Monte Blanc. But it's the Opera that stood out. Wish they would serve more of the items from the opening menu. I missed those! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but worth it - highest quality sushi & excellent service,positive,50,16-Nov-11,"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. If you are a sushi connoisseur, this is a must. They only serve the highest quality sushi - the fish is flown in from Japan 5 times per week. They have an excellent selection of sake by the bottle & carafe. Service is faultless and decor is simple, aesthetically pleasing and very Japanese. It is very expensive, but absolutely worth it."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Yum Cha,positive,40,7/8/2015,"If you want good Yum Cha without the tourist trimmings - this is for you. Set up a long flight of stairs, hidden amongst China Town shops - well worth the fine. You will get a good feed here of quality local food without the grandeur.Basic seating, restaurant has no view but is cool. Service is ok - but the food is why you are here and it delivers.Would definitely be back."

French,L_Angelus,Beautiful evening in a real French! Not so expensive,positive,50,2-Sep-16,"Went to this restaurant following advice from hotel concierge . He told me it was one of the oldest French in town, a bit on the expensive side . But I was pleasantly surprised as they have a fantastic menu for a reasonable price ( around 68 $ if I am not wrong). They are celebrating 18 years in Singapore . Well, I had a very good chicken liver terrine , as good as in some high end bistro in Paris and my friend tried the snails who were to die for ! My main was a very good lamb, juicy tender rack perfectly cooked with a very very good ratatouille . My friend had the duck, a farm one, very tasty. Excellent dessert ( I had their hot chocolate cake, it's a very good one !). They gave good wines too and I understood from the manager lady they import most of them so pricing is very decent for Singapore . We got a bottle of a wine from south of France , Les Brunes , a kind of boutique wine that was superb and only 98$. Good value for money all in one . Honestly, I felt like in Paris in a very good bistro . Service is ok. Great place, good value. I recommend ."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A very special night out,positive,50,4-Oct-12,"We had a night out at Waku Ghin on the 23rd of September 2012 for my husband's 39th birthday, We had 5 guests so we fitted around the teppinyaki style table easily. It was a bit awkward at first as there was no music and as we were all sitting next to each other, table conversation was difficult. We all soon forgot about this however when our chef came out and introduced himself. This guy was amazing, he answered all our questions (believe me, there were A LOT) all the while preparing us an array of beautiful dishes. The food was excellent, I tried a few things that I hadn't before (which is rare as we eat out a lot). The food was very different to Tetsuya's Sydney restaurant, much more Japanese in style.We were lukcy enough to get a tour of the pristine kitchen before we made our way to the ''dessert room'' for another 3 courses of desserts (one was a birthday cake surprise...) along with coffee, tea and petit fours (and in our case a beautiful bottle of dessert wine)Yes it is expensive but the attention to detail and service is worth it. The staff even cleaned and boxed up our abalone shells after the meal so we could take them home with us to Australia, nothing was too much trouble.An unforgettable experience"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service and Quality of food,negative,20,28-Aug-18,"Buffet is Not value for money.Sevice staff not up to expectation - either too new or too busy and little customer delighting , so unlike the japanese customer service culture"

These things made this place have a luxurious and romantic ambiance. I had a great dinner at here. Highly recommend. I will get back if I have a chance to visit Singapore again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exceptional Quality,positive,50,14-Nov-13,"Anytime you are looking for guaranteed high quality and delicious food - count Waku Ghin among your options. I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Chilli Crab!,positive,50,12/10/2017,"Great food, especially the chilli crab with mantou. We ordered another serving! Also the fresh baby sotong with chilli and lime, and the signature prawn dish. All in all, a satisfying meal and friendly service too!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food worth a visit,positive,50,4-Sep-16,"I visited Angelina with my mom. We ordered a soup, 2 mains, opera cake and the signature hot chocolate drink. The signature hot chocolate was very good. The complimentary olive bread goes well with the butter. The food was tasty but a bit pricey. We plan on visiting soon. Location was good as it is easily accessible by bus or train."

Where are your French standards Paul?! This is the typical example of a low-cost, low-class excellent value-for-money shop that tries to export a luxury ""look"" just because they are French. You clearly failed! You are better off sticking to what you do best, Paul: nice, tasty boulangerie.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Carnivore’s dream come true,positive,40,30-Aug-14,"As an avowed carnivore, L’Entrecôte is my idea of heaven- the only main course is steak! Not just any steak though, a mouth-watering entrecôte steak accompanied by a fresh green salad and refillable fries, at the end of the meal we were completely full. Although located in Duxton Hill, the atmosphere of L’Entrecôte reminded me of a Bistro I used to visit in Paris (tables very close to each other, waiters running around, plenty of glasses of wine on each table!) reflecting the authenticity of the restaurant."
French,Paul,Poor,negative,10,16-Nov-15,"If you like poor coffee, average food, clearing the table yourself, having to go in to order and pay because everyone is too 'busy' then this is the place for you. Otherwise....avoid."
French,Saveur,Restaurant was inflexible in stanchart credit card promo,negative,30,31-Dec-16,"Having been to Saveur since its beginnings as a stall in Tanjong Katong Coffeeshop, it has come a long way. however, the expansion seems to cause some quality of food, roots and values to be eroded. Other than the food whose quality somewhat is not comparable to the good old days, Staff were also incapable of being customer centric when dealing with the credit card promo, which really ended the dinner on a sour note for my friend who was footing the bill. Definitely higher standards are needed for this restaurant to stay its course. "

Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Worst food,negative,30,18-Jan-16,"I noticed leftovers on tabled as the service is slow, mostly 70-75% left food. Probably they did not liked. Owners should spend more time. No taste of indian food. Took 30 minutes to service with 5 customers in waiting."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Sad Chinese Meal,negative,20,10/29/14,"We went to this restaurant late, maybe the staff was tired because we waited 20 mins to be seated despite the seats visibly available. Then it took a long time for some one to take our order, problem is they leave a menu and a sheet which you write the corresponding no. No one can explain the dishes.What we order was not available and what we finally got was pretty awful. It did not suit our taste. All in all it was a lousy dining experience in a fancy restaurant on our second night in Singapore. I would recommend you go there if you have someone who understands chinese food and who can help you order."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere. Great streetfood,positive,40,19-Sep-15,"A must go in Singapore. Experience the hawker streetfood and eat among the locals. Good solid food. Great variety, since 20+ small kitchens and basic seating & eating facilities under open sky. In general only cash payment. Serves beer as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,An Amazing Institution,positive,50,08/22/17,"If you like seafood, this is the place to go to, but make sure to wear a colourful shirt, because it is all about eating with hands... Aprons are available for those who want one. The Pepper Crab and Child Crab are truly excellent dishes, when ordering ask the staff to crack the shells for you if you want to avoid doing this yourself... The crabs are massive, but If you want the really big crabs, order them in advance to avoid disappointment as they sell VERY quickly. The Razor Clams are also excellent as are the prawns and generally other seafood dishes. Great to go in a group and order plenty of beer by the pitcher. The staff are great, friendly and happy to provide fast, efficient service. What a great time we had... One small negative point, catching taxi's from the restaurant is not as easy as you would expect... but gives you a chance to walk off the excellent food you have indulged in!!!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",tokyo class sushi,positive,40,26-Oct-15,very high standard but expensive but it gets the job done! it's all sushi and best to have the omakase
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent,positive,50,8-Dec-15,Have been to Kailash Parbat in India many time and found the one in Little India to be as good as the one in India. Good options for vegetarians. When placing the order remember that the quantity is good (much more than in most places) so place an order accordingly. Food was good and so was the service. Good atmosphere. If in Little India opt for Kailash parbat much better than all the restaurants opposite Mustafa market. As they are opposite Mustafa normally one goes but Kailash Parbat is also hardly 3 to 5 minutes walk from mustafa
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, very friendly service",positive,50,06/21/17,"The food was very tasty. We were a gathering of 20 and had a private room.

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lame London Fat Duck,negative,30,04/18/17,"Tasty no doubt. The duck and the xiao long bao were prepared well. My big concern was the duck serving size. Almost half the duck served was bone. Nothing much to eat. Disappointing. Would have rated it 2 of 5, but the xiao long bao saved the day. Somehow. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Always good steak,positive,40,21-Dec-16,"We have tried other steak restaurants in Singapore but keep coming back to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill. The steak is always trimmed of fat, cooked exactly as requested, the sauce always tasty and the portions a good size. The service is always at a high standard. Fridays and Saturdays are always busier with the nearby bars open, but it is very quiet and easy to get a table on Sunday nights."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding Japanese food,positive,50,7-Apr-17,"I love Japanese food so I decided to treat myself when I was working in Singapore (why not?). Shinji seems to offer two sittings for lunch and the restaurant is very intimate with seating around the bar so you watch the chefs work. Perfect.I arrived for my lunch to a warm greeting and a stool for my bag. I decided to have the 'chef's surprise' whereby the chef prepares a number of different dishes for you, including hot dishes, and a selection of sashimi and sushi. I can only describe the meal as exceptional. I loved watching my sushi being prepared for me individually, the quality was incredible. The other dishes were works of art on a plate and were just as outstanding as the other dishes.I started taking notes of what I was eating so I could tell my other half when I got home but stopped after the fourth dish and just savoured the whole experience.This was an expensive treat to myself but it was one that I will always remember. I fully intend to return next time I'm in Singapore."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Below expectations and disappointment,negative,30,02/27/18,"A lunch visit to Peach Blossom for a celebratory event is an annual affair for me and my family. It was chosen because it had good service and good food, and therefore, we decided to visit it again for the third year this time - thinking that it won't fail us.This year, instead of the ala carte menu, we went for the dim sum ala carte buffet menu. We were led to this table nearest to the exit of the kitchen, which is at the far end of the restaurant. We were still looking at the menu and one of the waiters actually came asking if we would like to have our drinks ordered first. We were flustered as we just settled down but he was insistent that we have our drinks ordered. Thus, having to visit here for several times, I ordered a tea named as ???? without even looking at the menu. It is a tea which I knew the restaurant will have. My brother ordered a ????. To my disappointment, the waiter was unable to recognise that my brother had ordered Oolong tea and was trying to say that there wasn't such tea in the menu until he found it during his panic. And so our drinks were being ordered.As it was our first try at their buffet menu, we did not know which menu should we look at. We queried and the waiter explained to us that we can order anything and also if we were to order dim sum which are not listed in the buffet menu, we will need to pay the outstanding amount. Ok, we understood it. Then came the ordering and missing of multiple orders. The table next to us was a big eater and they ordered more items than us, with similar items ordered and ordered later than us, and theirs were served first but not ours! Oh, not to mention that they were served by the SAME waiter. We later ordered a Cheong Fun from the non-buffet menu and the waiter was trying to tell us that we will need to pay extra in a super ""I cannot comprehend"" intonation plus stuttering. Well, since he mentioned that we will need to pay extra, we said OK! But guess what? It wasn't served at all and we queried him about it. And he said ""I told you that it needed extra money"". Oh.. ok! It's a freaking S$5.80 Cheong Fun and you think we cannot afford it? But anyways, we decided to just end our happening lunch experience as we had enough of begging for our food like a beggar. Also, the food was really not appealing anymore. The Xiaolongbao was not seasoned with loads of Huatiao wine as before, the XO carrot cake looked more like XO fried egg as I ate more eggs than the cake, and the tea was really not flavourful anymore. I think I will really reconsider or not consider my next visit to Peach Blossoms."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Terrible Experience,negative,10,27-May-16,"Made a booking at 8pm and came earlier. Waiter mentioned that restaurant is fully booked and insisted to give us the counter seat. There were several empty tables around until 8pm. No table seats were given to us at 8pm, worse still the bbq counter caught fire, there were alot of smoke, no contingency plan to move us to other table, only after a good'o 15mins they decided to move us to an empty table.Over at the new table, electronic food transfer was not done properly and some of our food is missing. Period."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced for what it is,negative,30,4-Apr-17,We hit many hawker centres across the city and this one was by far the most expensive.Our taxi driver had warned us they have had issues with ripping customers off here - I can see why. The beers and water were significantly pricier than elsewhere.The food was good but not the best we had in Singapore. It was full of locals but actually seemed the least authentic of the dozen hawker markets we visited. I say this because it was the only one that had true hawkers trying to sell us their wares. This is what made it feel as though it was staged for those looking for this experience.It seemed to mainly cater for seafood which is all well and good but for me variety truly is the spice of life. There is nowhere near the choice of the likes of Amoy Street.We ate at Alliance Seafood (in the Michelin Guide) which I cannot deny was very nice - the prawns were very tasty indeed. Shame we left Newton wishing for more.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Food round the clock,positive,40,13-Sep-18,The best thing about the place is food was served around the clock.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh sashimi, everything else average",negative,30,17-Oct-16,Food was not as good as I remembered from a few years ago. But quality of the sashimi was still good and fresh. Teppanyaki was good in terms of taste but they could be more generous with the quantity per serving. Maki and other sushi were passable to say the least. Nothing memorable. Service was also a little slow - it took awhile for our food to be served and the time lag between dishes was quite long. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Singapore seafood in informal setting,negative,30,10/2/2015,"Came here at the suggestion of local friends to taste chilli crab. It was good, but not great. Better the pepper crab. Both priced at SGD 72. Also interesting is the razor clam, huge but overpriced at SGD 16 EACH. With some house prawns (SGD 30) and some side dishes, plus 5 Tiger beer, the bill was SGD 400, IMHO a bit excessive considering the cheap setting, paper napkins and basic level of service.Be careful not to take a table at the far end of the terrace or you might end up spending the evening listening to the karaoke next door..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Simply Superb,positive,50,19-Jun-15,"If you are going to splash out once in Singapore then this is the place. Everything from start to finish was superb.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilli Crabs in Singapore,positive,50,05/31/15,You can't visit Singapore without trying the Chilli Crabs and the best place to get them is Long Beach at Dempsy Hill. I have had them at other places in Singapore but this tops them all. And while you're at it get an order of the razor clams as an appetizer.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",is a meal at this level really only about the food?,negative,20,19-Jul-12,"I have dined at most of the San Pel 50 and was quite looking forward to an innovative experience at Waku Ghin following a glowing review from a fellow foodie, but was a little hesitant given that it was in MBS and thus created to cater to the brash crowd that frequent this destination. I will describe the 4 components that pull a restaurant together seperately. Ambience, Food, Drinks and Service (not in any order of preference)Ambience- Pleasently decorated the segregated dining experience can be a bit of a hit or miss dependent on whom you have as your dining companions. 5 people in a segregated room for 8 courses glued to a Tepan table with the chefs commentary and no music, can mean that the 3 Russian speakers constantly requring explanations about what each ingredient is from a not fully articulate staff could either be a comedy or very cruel torture. For us it was indifferent as we were focussed on not being disturbed, but I can definitely see the downside to this arrangement.Food-Great delivery of some very well cooked if not technically complicated dishes. Given the same quality of ingrediants it would not take a culinary genius to put this together.The Abalone was truly tyre like though and Michelin may well prove to ask this restaurant for some tips on the other side of there business. The beef and lobster were beautiful and the Uni with Caviar and prawns, was very clever combining. Our chef was a plesure. exert s a major let down.Drinks- The wine by the glass selection is weak and the lack of a paired menu disappointing at this level. They tried very hard to up sell and get us to order a bottle of white and red, but as I was the only drinker of the two of us this was never going to happen. I did manage 6 glasses of different wines and the Torbreck was definitely a winner (Well done David Powell again). On the whole a collection of overpriced overly marked up wines aimed at the typical crowd who would be more driven by labels then a sound sommelier who could point you in the right direction. (When I fesiously asked what part of France my desert wine was from, I received a blank look, which was strange as a Sauternes can not b fro any where else) At this level and these prices a little training will not go far a miss.Service - Poor, badly in need of additional training and completely the ultimate let down for this restaurant. The staff generally needed to probably dine in true fine dining establishments, be given lessons in eloquence and understanding of what they are supposed to be doing and then let out on the training floor. This was an unacceptable element of the meal. Lack of knowledge was evident at every turn.Overall- At USD 1000++ for 2 people this was definately poor value. You can only rest on your laurels for so long Mr. Tetsuya. If this left the San Pel List i would imagine it would close in a year."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great ingredients and faultless service,positive,40,28-Mar-15,"Online booking is a breeze and the email responses are rapid and thorough. The restaurant takes seatings for dinner only at 6.30pm and 8.30pm. Menu is a 10-item degustation where dietary restrictions are entertained. There is a bar outside and drinks can be brought into the restaurant proper. There are 2 private rooms/cooking stations where 7-8 guests sit at a table in front of a chef. The fresh seafood ingredients are presented to diners for their admiration before dinner starts. Diners are offered still, sparkling or mineral water with free flow over the evening for a fixed price per person. We had the famed botan shrimp with uni and caviar, abalone, scampi and lobster. A thin piece of ohmi beef was also on the menu. The Japanese chef was polite but not completely comprehensible. We enjoyed his cooking techniqes. At one point we were politely advised by a member of the wait staff not to take videos of the cooking, but that still photos were fine. After the savoury dishes diners then are invited to a lounge for desserts, where desserts, petit fours and coffee/tea are served to round off the meal. I found the food tasty and well-presented, although I think it is hard to go wrong with the premium ingredients used. I did not find the dishes exceptional in creativity - no real 'wow' factor. All in all, was happy I came, but do not think it's worth coming again in view of the price! One can get excellent Japanese (and other food) for a fraction of the cost with equivalent satisfaction."

There are an excellent variety of foods at Newton and the quality is very good. I however would recommend other places such as Glutton's Bay near the Esplanade, or Lau Pa Sat for the scenery and location. If you are near then by all means go but it does not warrent a special trip."

If you wish to have some thing light they do serve sandwiches and snacks through the day. The only down side is you may have to wait a bit during weekends to get a table. Keep hogging..:)"

We had the Omakase and we were very impressed by everything that was served by the chef. Food was so simple and delicious and we enjoyed watching the chef in action.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","GIve it a go and wear your loosest, lightest clothes-there is no breeze.",positive,40,23-Dec-09,"I went last night with boyfriend, we recently moved to Singapore and heard this was a different type of Hawker Centre. It is, it's recently been refurbished so lots of flashing lights and definitely aimed towards tourists. But, if you've only been here a week, (as we have) and have struggled a few times to get what you're after in the very local Hawkers, Newton is a good place to start.Don't be put off by the way the owners try to engage in conversation and get you to check out their menus. It is a bit forceful but, once you take a seat, you can decide what you fancy, every style of food is available, BBQ, lots of fresh Seafood, etc. It can get busy so if you see a good table, grab it.We started by letting this guy show us his menu and asked him what was good, i fancied a Laksa so he fetched me one with cockels, i'd never heard of this type before but it was delicious, shame they used Spaghetti which they seem to do here quite a bit....give me Udon noodles!!Then, he fetched us some Swordfish, warned us that it was spicy, maybe too spicy...we love spicy, it wasn't spicy. I was told, if you ask for a dish 'home style' they will make it with the heat which ordinarilly they'd remove for tourists.We also had a selection of satay sticks and about 4 little cans of Tiger beer each, all for less than $50. The lady selling us the beer actually brought us over a couple of free ones before we left and both she and the guy we initially spoke to made a point of coming over to say goodbye when we were leaving, very sweet and friendly. I would recommend it to anyone."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good but not great,negative,30,19-Dec-15,"ive had the mussels and ive had the steak here, having been to its counterpart in paris i was expecting something on the same level but was a little disappointed. The mussels were very nice and came with bottomless french fries, however the steak was a let down, it was tough and rather tasteless despite the sauce.The service on the other hand was very good and everyone was very friendly.I'd go back for the mussels but not the steak. I've rated it average but only because there wasn't a ""good"" but i wouldn't go so far as to say ""very good"". It was also kinda of expensive, for that kind of money i was expecting a better meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good service, food was very good but pricey for such a casual restaurant",negative,30,08/21/16,Service very good and being new to the local seafood scene lots of help with ordering and recommendations. Chili and pepper crab very good as were the razor clams. Only observation is that is really is a very casual dining experience but at a high price point. Mainly catering to the expat and tourist crowd so lacked that local feel.
French,L_Angelus,Good French bistro dinner,positive,50,30-Jun-18,"Came here for my wife's birthday dinner, though we didn't tell the restaurant since she likes it low-key.We had- Mixed green salad with roquefort blue cheese and bacon- Pan-Fried Dover Sole, Butter Lemon Sauce, Steamed Potatoes- Cassoulet (Meats And Sausages, Served With Duck Confit And Pork Belly)- Hot Chocolate CakeMixed salad is good quality, though nothing spectacular. Nice Roquefort.The cassoulet is always my favourite, and it's enough to feed 2 persons (that's me). If you like baked beans, this would be for you. Doubly so if you like meats, as it as duck confit, pork belly and loads of sausages. 80% of the time it's done well, though on another occasion I felt that the meats were a bit tough.The dover sole was very good, though it never comes cheap (in any restaurant in Singapore). With the butter sauce it was fantastic.Chocolate cake nice enough, though I prefer the ""lava"" type where it oozes out instead of just being liquidy.All in all a very good meal again (though it would have been 4 stars during my second visit, per my earlier comment about the tougher meat in the cassoulet)."

It was best in Indian test and the chaat was awesome.we really enjoyed a all our meals and thanks to the helping staff. The ambiance is average and it was clean. On our special request the chef and cooked non spicy food for children and we are glad to them. located opposite to mustufa center.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Food court setting, oustanding duck and pork, peculiar service",positive,40,06/28/17,"The place feels like a mall food court setup. The duck is delicious, the bbq pork belly is crunchy and taste great. Try the pressed pig year (appetizer, cold cut). It looks great sliced and tastes better than it looks.If you have a healthy appetite don't bother with anything less than half duck. It's not as big as it sounds.I was a bit disappointed with the duck tongue appetizer. It comes with the jaw bone attached.I understand this is an Asian restaurant but I thing they could use a few wines on the menu.Service is strange: different wait stuff stops by every once in a while, checks your order (which stays on the table), go away. One of the waitresses did that, then walked two tables away and stared at me while I was eating. I guess she was getting bored, it was late, place was almost empty."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck ... disappointing,negative,30,08/31/16,"We had heard so much about London Fat Duck and decided to check it out for ourselves. We ordered the Pork Congee with Century Egg, and Roast Duck Noodles. Both were pretty good. Unfortunately the rest of the dim sum items ordered did not hit the mark at all.The Duck Snow Buns were way too sweet; and so was the Steamed Chee Cheong Fun. The Shrimp in Crispy Beancurd Skin Fritters were super greasy and almost dripping in oil. The Crispy Black Pepper Duck Spring Rolls were indeed crispy but the filling was again too sweet and I found the black pepper to be overpowering. The panfried carrot cake was just average.My advice to the restaurant: stick to serving the roast meats and forget the dim sum."

French,L_Angelus,Consistently good,positive,40,11-Jan-14,"This year marks 10 years in Singapore and I have been here many times. Last night a group of us turned up on spec and scored a table outside, sans reservation. Result, as it meant some people-watching was enabled and now Club St is busy as anything this was all good.We had nibbled snacks at the various bars that lay littered in our trail to the restaurant so starters were declined and we went straight to mains. 3 confit de canard and 1 bavette frites were swiftly ordered and we sat back with a bottle of reasonably priced St Emilion to watch people until the food arrived.I am a big fan of confit de canard and I think L'Angelus may do the best outside France in my opinion. Succulent and tender, with crisp skin, it is an art form. The game chips with are pungent with garlic and superbly salty, just right to offset the rich duck. Our steak-eating friend was deeply impressed with his steak, so that was good too, as he paid with the company Amex. Huzzah!Another bottle of red, this time the wine of the month, which was also reasonably priced, and we waddled away pleasantly replete."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Black pepper crab,positive,40,8-Feb-18,"I've been to this place many times. I think tourist have to choose the good seller than the bad one in here. I always come to the lady that have shop in the middle of the hawker at the right end (forgot the hawker number). Her menu for the crab has a price also for small, medium or large so it's a fixed price. She always give me a small price for a medium crab. I paid S$ 42 for a medium black pepper crab which is quite good. The taste is delicious as well."

French,Paul,A Real Patisserie in Orchard Road,positive,40,24-Aug-15,"There are quite a few 'ordinary' places for afternoon tea in Orchard Road but Paul's looked better than most so we tried it, and were not disappointed. There a pleasant, upholstered armchairs, dark, polished wooden tables and, being a couple of floors up, there was a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere away from the bustle of the shopping centre. The patisseries and cakes taste as good as they look and are typical of some of those you might find in Paris or in a good German konditorei. The coffee is good, without being exceptional, but enjoyable nonetheless. Service was good, though not always as attentive as in other cafes. We will go back next time we want a pleasant break from Orchard Road."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab in town,positive,50,07/20/12,"The whole package is simply excellent. The food, service and location are reason why its for me the best crab restaurant in Singapore. There might be better place for the food somewhere at a street place, but the location and the staff cannot be beaten. Very recommendable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi served here,positive,40,24-Apr-16,"We had lunch ala-carte buffet here. Many varieties to choose from and we love their sashimi most. Very fresh Salmon, tuna, yellow tail, red snapper, etc.. others like takoyaki, grilled saba fish, salad, yakitori, were good as well. Food served to us fast & efficient. Can order in small portions which is good and you dont waste food. Staffs were friendly and helpful. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware of overpriced items,negative,30,20-Feb-16,"Very good variety of local food. However, tourists must beware. Some of these hawkers will sell you food that are way overpriced. Eating in a hawker centre should be a cheap and affordable experience. Not an expensive one. Check prices of items before ordering and you will never go wrong."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unlimited fries (and steak!),positive,40,14-Feb-17,"I've read everywhere online that this place is amazing for steak and fries - I mean how can they not be, if that's the only thing on their mains menu? I also read that they have unlimited fries, and not only did they deliver on that, they also gave everyone extra steak! Not sure if it was just the weekend that I went (which was the weekend right before Valentine's Day), but no complaints here!The restaurant itself is extremely crowded and you're barely 20cm away from the next table because they cram a table into every single area available, but their turnover is super fast and they're very efficient. The ambience and food is so good that after a while you forget the crowdedness anyway.Overall, great food, great service and I would totally come back again!"
French,Paul,Bad service ,negative,10,5-Nov-17,"We were attended by waiters who were rude and frustrated with customers and among themselves. Drink came 20 min and food almost 45 min as orders was not put in. Saw waiters went from table to table asking if the dish he was holding was for them. When asked why the potatoes was not cooked inside. First waiter said ‘it’s steamed’ and second waiter said ‘that’s how it serve, raw.’"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Sting Ray Tastic,positive,50,18-Dec-12,"Yes it's the 'touristy' place, but also mobbed by locals, hell pay a little more and you'll still enjoy it.

French,L_Angelus,Fabulous little French restaurant,positive,40,14-Jan-18,We had dinner here on 2 of our 4 nights in Singapore. Excellent menu with just enough variety to the fixed menu (5 options for each serving) at an excellent $68 each. Entree options were excellent with a special mention to the goat cheese salad. Yummy.Tuna steaks with sesame seed coating were our favourite main though the second night they were a bit cool.Dessert was fabulous and the bread as it should be in a French restaurant was superb.All up a lovely restaurant and well worth a visit.

French,L_Angelus,Unsatisfying,negative,30,13-Feb-16,"For a French restaurant, nothing could be more insulting than to be told your experience was unsatisfying, but that's exactly how we finished this dinner feeling. Had to leave for airport at 9:30 so wanted a great ""last night"" meal and cancelled Morton's to go here instead. Wrong move. I'm an Francophile so know my French cuisine very well and whilst the menu is French classics in theory, it's sadly not in practice. As another reviewer noted ""not the French flavor"".Got there around 6:45 and instead of sitting us at a table and offering a Kir, sent us away with ""we don't open until 7:00pm"" so we found a bar across the road and duly waited. Bread was great, good start. Pan fried fois gras good, but the product speaks for itself. Onion soup reasonable, not the best, but not the worst, and as my husband makes a great one with home made veal stock, it's unfair to compare. Main course, tartare and onglet (blue) with french fries, that were not really French fries. Too thick. Tartare was OK, a standard tartare and expectations were met, but no ""wow"" factor. The onglet was off - it tasted and smelt odd. You begin to doubt yourself initially because after all, this is a good restaurant n'est pas? It was red, and looked OK, but there was this distinctive odor and taste. I gave my husband a mouthful, he said straight away, ""no, that's not right"". It was left. When they asked what was wrong I asked them to ask the Chef what he thought about the steak. They returned and said ""that's what a blue steak tastes like"". I've been eating my steak blue all my life, even before I lived in France, so I know what it should taste like. I love my food and eat absolutely everything, and could count on one hand food that I rejected. This was one of them.I wasn't offered the choice to order something else at the time, but noted it was not charged on the bill, which was appropriate. We had lava cake and creme caramel, both average. I was told this was run by a Frenchman, but he was nowhere to be seen front of house or in the kitchen on a Friday night. Wait staff were attentive, but Chinese chefs cooking French cuisine is akin to French chefs cooking chinese food. It simply won't taste authentic. Wine list is expensive, a carafe of wine whilst good is $60+"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food,positive,40,14-Dec-17,We enjoyed the food as the portion is decent and the quality is better than we expected for buffet. The only thing that can be better is cleanliness of the place as our seats initially were dirty which the waiter offered to clean up for us and the floor had paper napkins too.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit booth #70 - Ms Tan.,positive,50,6-Oct-15,"First of all, #70 serves a variety of lovely food in a great and thriving environment you find at Newton Food Center. Second, Ms Tan offers the best hospitality. She is a great mix of being very welcoming and attentive, but on a very comfortable level, as opposed to many others who can be a bit too much. Definitely a place I go to eat every time I visit the city, which I also recommend to all my friends, and now also YOU."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good Food and Service,positive,50,21-Jun-14,"I can see a mix of good and bad reviews here. Firstly, I use the palate card that offers 50% discount when dining with one other. So that makes the meals here extremely reasonable. With regards to the water on offer, we always opt for the normal water as opposed to the still or sparkling options.I always order the steak and fries while my wife orders the chicken dish. Both are always good, we like the free flow of fries that come with the steak though you have to ask for it or they will not be refilled.Service is good and we always leave this place happy. Have yet to experience the bad service experienced by the other reviewers."
French,Saveur,Cosy with no frills,positive,40,27-Dec-16,Had the duck confit and pistachio panna cotta. Both were excellent albeit the small serving size. White and red wine are affordable at $9 per glass. Excellent service as well!
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Breathtaking and Inventive,positive,50,29-Nov-17,"Went to Waku Ghin on first time visit to Singapore, persuaded in part by TripAdvisor reviews. Were not disappointed. This place is VERY expensive (e.g. more than Alinea in Chicago!), and situated above a large casino in the flashy Marina Bay Sands complex- never a good sign.Nevertheless, the meal soared above expectations, the best Japanese cuisine we've ever experienced (note: never visited Japan itself). Among the standout items:1) the signature dish (pictured), a savory medley of tender raw shrimp, succulent, sweet uni and caviar. To die for delicious2) the abalone, steamed on the griddle on a bed of sea salt (!), and covered with lemon slices and seaweed, then served in its shell with a savory seaweed sauce- earthy, complex and delicate flavor.3) the lobster, slow cooked in a delicious spicy Asian sauce4) tiny chocolate mousse cake, with a tiny garland of gold leaf, intense, tart and sweet.The young chef who cooked our seafood, in a small private room shared with two other couples, was friendly, skillful, gracious and humble. The service was exceptional, not overbearing, but attentive and thoughtful. We had an amazing meal at Waku Ghin and recommend to Singapore travelers without hesitation. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peking duck a must have!,positive,40,03/17/13,"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Peach Blossom provides contemporary chinese cuisine in a nice quiet setting. I strongly reccomend a party of 4-6 people as any lesser, you wouldn't be able to order an assortment of dishes enough to compliment your palate. To start off, the soft shell crabs in salted egg yokes were delightfully cripsy. It's also not overly salted and the egg yoke coating wasn't soggy either unlike many Chinese eateries. Next up, the Peking duck. It cost about $70 per duck and serves about 15 servings of tiny little crepes packing in the fragrant duck skin, cucumbers and the delectable sauce too. It is unlikely u would stop at 2 crepes. The seafood fried rice with salmon roe was delicious too and to think we polished our bowls thoroughly even towards the end of the dinner is a compliment enough for this simple but tasty dish."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not so good,negative,30,09/16/12,"When we visit Long beach@ Dempsey i was a little bit disappointed because i am expecting that the food was really excellent. since it was my friend who recommend me to come to this place. so from bukit timah we drove here to Dempsey. they're popular of Black pepper crab, but that night i just want to have a prawns,chicken and the noodles.. the food presentation was ok, the staff is a little bit snobbish but its ok because it was busy at that time. so here it goes when we are about to eat the food i was shock and confused about the food that we order. Do we order food or MSG? all the food is full of MSG. we couldn't even finished our food.i need to drink a lot of water to clear my whole mouth and throat. but still the after taste of the MSG is still there. it lingers into my system. I think i should listen to my friend that i should try the Crab only."

The service and Food was excellent, I was bit worried because sometimes these Restaurants in Club Street are Full of Guest anyway and I guess most Guest are just there to enjoy the Atmosphere, so some Restaurants might get bit sloppy with Service and the Quality of the Food, however L'Angelus was seem to made an exception, only little manko my Dover Sole could have been a little more Cross but that's all to complain about, nice Atmospahre like a French Bistro in Paris."

In our own room with 5 diners, we were highly entertained by our chef who prepared each course in front of us. Our Japanese chef had worked in Sydney for some years and had excellent English. The food and ingredients were stunning and as expected, the service was impeccable. Moving to the Dessert Room is a wonderful conclusion to a perfect evening."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",This place has gone down in quality so much :(,negative,10,6-Mar-17,"Really sad to write about this place that used to be so good just two years ago! Everything has gone from bad to worse now. Just visited them last night. First, the waiters were basically unresponsive- had to keep following up to get simple orders...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch at Shin Minori,positive,40,5-Sep-17,"The Japanese Buffet spread is good and it is value for money. The service is good and the ambience is also conducive. Just feel that perhaps, Shin Minori can provide free flow of soft drinks."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sucks !,negative,10,10/20/16,"This is not worth visiting if you are a duck lover. Is a HK joint and most likely operated by mainland chinese in the kitchen.The braised duck wings are salty, salty and salty that's all I could remember. I couldn't even finish the small portion of wings. Simply too salty for my taste. And is the worst I have in my entire life.Regretted and will ever step into this place agian."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,good place for a big group,positive,40,07/14/17,"enjoyed the pepper crab, spicy crab, lobster and a plethora of other dishes. Atmosphere was festive, with Chinese-style private dining rooms. More a casual, big group place for celebrations than a place to take your sweetheart for a romantic dinner. If she wants a beer, a bib, and a big crab... then take her :)"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Review,positive,50,8/12/2017,First time visit with friends. Food was nice and delicious. Service was great. It's definitely worth to go with friends or family.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",True Indian Food,positive,50,18-May-15,This place will not let you miss your Indian Food. You will get the best quality indian food here. This restaurant is in the market area. a bit costly worth the money. Must try!!!!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The best Dim Sum in Chinatown,positive,40,12/13/13,It is great this restaurant. The dim sum is delicious. After 3:00pm they have open buffet with a lot of different choices. The decoration is very nice and cozy.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Poor taste and bad service...,negative,20,8/10/2017,"We were disappointed as we used to come at this place years back and the food, athmosphere and service were much nicer...
Even the table was not stable..."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A Delightful Birthday Celebration at Peach Blossom,positive,50,08/24/17,"We celebrated a birthday event at this restaurant which was superb. The food was delicious but what made it more special was the efforts of the staff to make our event special. Christine who was serving us was great with her service and her birthday wishes salutations to the birthday girl. Well done Christine. Also Terry who especially made a small birthday gift fashioned in the form of miniature Chinese "" Sau Pow"" . was exquisitely done. Birthday girl was delighted.Well done Peach Blossom. Thank You once again for great service , great food and your wonderful staff who are always cheerful and so service oriented."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","A unique service & experience, decadent menu but perfect execution",positive,50,18-Oct-16,"I was dying for a gastronomic dinner after a dry period of the last few months and some poor restaurant experiences. So I was really looking forward to this and it did not let me down. The menu was as decadent as it can be. From caviar, foie gras, uni, scallop, abalone, fatty tuna, A5 Wagyu and several other usual suspects to the introduction of new ingredients I had never come across before like sea grass, large botan shrimp etc this menu was a compliation of the biggest hits in the food world. I have had a similar experience in Robuchon before but whereas Robuchon was more show-off style and not much good mix of flavours, at Waku Ghin everything was like a journey of flavours and each distinct to each other. The staff were great with attention to detail and style of service. Can only expect this from a Japanese chef. I dont know how they do it but its heartwarming experience. Bravo, needless to say I would only recommend this to whoever can afford it. Its is $660 per person including a couple of drinks."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Intense Flavors Flame Your Palate,positive,40,13-Apr-14,"We enjoy fiery food and Muthu's Curry marks the menu to denote heat.
The flavors are an authentic match to foods we ate in India. The curry sauce of the prawn dish is superb. We had palek paneer, chicken masala, black dal, the very large...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unsatisfied Dining Exoerience,negative,10,16-May-17,Food is too salty!! Food ordering system is slow. Service is slow! Location isn't ideal although parking is easy!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent dinner and service ,positive,50,02/16/17,"My family and I had a wonderful dinner and we are served so well by the friendly staff, Mr Terry, Ms Sook Teng, Ms Bowei and Ms Christine. I will definitely recommend to all my associates!"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Excellent Buffet & Service,positive,40,24-May-13,"Its the best service i can get even comparing it with hotel chains like Parkroyal's Chatz or Marriott's Wan Hao or Shook. The staff were young, probably students but they go all out with smiles and extended their hospitality to you with lots of actions...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent but pricy!,positive,40,20-Aug-13,Try the chats! It's the best u will get in singapore. Also the dinner items are delicious! A bit pricy when compared to other nearby hotels. Try the lassi as well. 2-3 plates of chat n lassi itself can cost u around 30-40 sgd!!! Good to go occasionally!! 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive as advertised but well worth the visit,positive,50,3-Sep-12,"Access was tricky, lifts behind Hermes. We had our own room which served 4 and our own chef to prepare in front of us, modern teppanyaki style. The uni and cavier was exquisite, out of this world, the abalone presentation was also understanding. The fish was delicate but the three servings of beef was one too many, each was wonderful but come the 3rd sliver, the experience was waning. The food service was excellent and the chefs engaging but we had limited interaction with anyone other than those directly serving us.All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dinner we will remember for the food and the company. You can't enjoy this except for really special occassions, which I will look forward to again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible,negative,10,17-Jan-17,"Service was terrible, food was over fried and over salted. It took forever for anything we ordered to arrive, and it was cramp and sounded like a fish market. For $10 more, we could have gone to Marriot for their weekend buffet, We are never, ever returning."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Japanese food,positive,40,12-Mar-16,"With the promotional 1 for 1, it makes the buffet really value for money. The sashimi were good in general, most dishes were pleasant, nothing much to comment on negatively."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unacceptably Long Waiting Time,negative,20,16-Feb-18,"Although the food was value-for-money, the waiting time for the food was way too long. Furthermore, staff seemed to lack communication and coordination amongst one another. When the food arrived, the number of portions we ordered for each dish were inaccurate, usually giving us a lesser amount than we ordered. Perhaps the system of ordering through an iPad during peak hours could be revised and an alternative method for ordering can be implemented if the kitchen and staff are unable to cope with the overwhelming number of orders being entered in a short period of time. Hopefully this can be improved on ASAP. By doing so, this will naturally improve the restaurant atmosphere. Thanks. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London fat duck review,negative,10,06/19/15,"Although I am a lover of fatty food but thought the duck is too fat for my liking. The duck bun is good though. What surprised me is the bad service and attitude. We ordered quite a lot of food and when we are about 80 % done, the manager came and ask if we want any dessert, we answered no and he showed an unhappy face and said ""if you don't mind hurry up, there was a long queue"". We are only there for 1/2 an hour (including waiting 10 minutes for the food) and we are fast eater. The manager also ordered the waiters to collect the plates while we were eating, at first I thought they wanted to change plates, but no, the replacement never came until I asked. Anyway I wont go there again, duck nothing to shout about and I think I prefer dian xiao er."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great time,positive,50,04/18/17,"Our family had birthday celebration last weekend at the restaurant. Good food, great time. Service really good. Environment is clean and comfortable. We chosen the sit down buffet. Great choice, introduced by the manager. It is really value for money. Was told the Chilli crab is good there, have not tried it. But will definitely find time to try. $300 to $350 for 5. Tim Sum and stir fried. Lobster, fish, prawn..... lots to have"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The breakfast of champions,positive,50,10-Jul-15,"Having looked briefly at the overpriced breakfast at the Sheraton I walked across the street to get breakfast at the Newton Hawker Center. At that early time there were only a few stands open, among which a fruit/smoothie stand, a noodle and duck stand, a congee stand, and a drink stand. The noodle with duck chunks in a dark soup was spectacular. The coffee was the usual sweet milk Singapore coffee (no espresso makers here). The fruit fresh. The whole thing cost seven singapore dollars, the same as a cup of better coffee in the Sheraton dining room. Hawker centers are a unique (as far as I know) Singaporean feature, and I have never been disappointed. In Singapore I only go to restaurants for the ambience !!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi We Have Ever had,positive,50,27-Feb-14,"This is an amazing restaurant and worth every cent. It is difficult to get in, but it is worth the wait and the money. GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",V Good Food,positive,40,2-Nov-11,It's a little like walking through the post tourist attraction gauntlet but the food is quite good. The section we sat at would grab food from a few different vendors so it worked well. Worth the trip over. Just a short walk from the Newton Metro station. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,negative,20,19-Jan-12,"If you are a tourist looking for a 'real' hawker centre experience do not go here. The food prices are highly inflated, the touts will drive you crazy and there are other touts who want to sell you sunglasses, watches etc. For a real experience, go to Lau Pa Sat in the financial district, If you are going to lunch you need to get there by 11:45 as the tables fill very quickly. Leave someone at your table to 'mind' it or place packets of disposable tissues at everyone's seats or you may come back to find others sitting in your seats. If you see an 'empty' table with packets of tissues on it, this means that the table has been taken."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worst service,negative,10,4-Apr-15,Eaten here few times but this time around the chef probably thought too much of their popularity. We paid sgd500 per head and at the end when my wife wanted to order an additional handroll because she was hungry the chef pointed at his wrist and said times up. Basically we had to leave. Food was also served in a hurried manner. Is this the service we expect from a supposedly fine dining restaurant?? Maybe in Singapore but definitely not in Japan.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Simple and tasty,positive,40,28-Jan-11,"You come here for one thing, a good steak and fries (even though i tried the couscous on the weekend once and was amazed by the quality of it, probably one of the best served that far from Magreb). Wine list is good, not great value but you're in Singapore... You will have to fork out 80-100$ to get something decent.Meat is good, fries home made. Nothing spectacular and yet one the best (western) restaurant on Robertston Quay."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tasty food, reasonable price",positive,40,27-Oct-16,"A big improvement on the old hawker centre I remember from years ago. All paved, clean, wash basins provided, and the food was good. Not cheap by street food standards but reasonably priced and a ""small"" serve was still plenty for one or as part of a number of share plates for two. Not overly hassled by vendors to take their menus. Selected from a variety of stalls. Service was quick. All the food was tasty. Mainly seafood but other meat choices available. Went on a friday night and no problems to get a table before 7pm but then was very busy after that. Better signage once you come out of the exit at Newton MRT would be useful (follow the path sharp left out of station exit)"
French,Saveur,Great Food Always!,positive,40,1-Mar-17,"Saveur is one of my favourite local chain restaurant in Singapore.They are specialised in French food with pocket frendly price.Love the Saveur pasta... it is soooo yummy. The duck confit is also one of my favourite and the meat is so nicely done and tender.As for the dessert, i would recommend the PISTACHIO PANNA COTTA!!! So smooth and delicious.Pls keep up the good work."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sky-high price for dinner, worth trying",positive,40,23-Mar-16,"This is certainly the most expensive restaurant I've tried so far, by quite a wide margin. Is it worth it? Perhaps....after all, the dishes did feature all the premium ingredients - truffles, caviar, lobster, wagyu beef... There's hardly a weak dish (for me it was the abalone, which was rather rubbery). Even the simplest-looking dish like a bowl of cold japanese noodle can be impressive.And of course you pay for the showmanship, as many of the dishes are cooked right in front of you. All the staff were professional and informative, including the Japanese chef in our room who explained each dish (he spoke excellent English). Drinks were very expensive (water for S$ 20++ !), and even having a glass of cocktail and another glass of wine could add to your bill substantially.But I think Waku Ghin could afford to be less rigid, and offer cheaper options for the set menu. In many fine dining restaurants, some premium ingredients are offered as optional supplements. After all, not everyone is crazy for caviar (or truffles, for that matter). Many years ago I went to Tetsuya's in Sydney and while it was a different cuisine (more Franco-Japanese than pure Japanese), it was much more affordable, with the same high level of technique in the dishes and a top service."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Love its podi idli and thosai,positive,40,10-Apr-17,"Whenever we went down to Singapore, this is the restaurant that we will also go to.. we love its podi idli and thosai which came with four type of tasty chutney. Its filters coffee is also superb. The negative side, dont go during peak period...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience,positive,40,4-Jul-17,"Must try hawker food in Singapore. Humble atmosphere, good food (ordered chili crab with mantau, garlic prawns, grilled stingray, etc), all delicious. But a bit more expensive than expected."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Its all about the duck,positive,40,04/16/16,"So there is some dim sum dishes but otherwise it is all about the duck. This is suppose to be the wagyu of duck air flown from Ireland - it is that good with a thick layer of fat between the skin and meat. There is very little else on the menu though, so its all about the duck!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",BEST Service and Excellent Taste ,positive,50,7-Jul-15,Cannot complaint about this restaurant at all. Taste of all the dishes are excellent and Service was good as well. Best Choice for Vegetarian.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",great vegetarian choices and tasty food,positive,40,22-Jul-15,"great vegetarian choices and tasty food next to the busy mustafa centre and south indian temples in little india area
the thali is a must on a day you craving for too much. dosas and parathas are for a lighter meal but all equally tasty"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Concerning,negative,10,11/26/13,"I am conflicted about writing this but I feel too compelled that I must share our experience over the weekend. We have come here before and have found the food and ambiance to be quite nice but this past weekend was a different story.We arrived at 9:30am with our toddler and asked for one of the open tables. The hostess said they were out of many things and said we should look at the menu before we sit down. True enough they were but we said we wanted to sit anyway. We asked for one of the outside tables and were told they could not accommodate a third chair or high chair for the baby. We said ok and waited for an inside table and the hostess did nothing. We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside tables with just two seats and I would have the baby sit in my lap. The hostess then said not enough space (if you have seen the tables you know they are certainly large enough). it was very clear they didn't want us there and so we started to walk away and my wife then spoke in Chinese about how disappointed she was and the hostess looked shocked that my wife knows the language. We left and won't be back, but on the upside had an amazing breakfast at the Holland V hawker center. Truly a shame."
French,Saveur,"Great food, but small portions",positive,40,5-Jan-18,"Had a gathering here with friends. It was unanimous that the food was fantastic, especially at its price range. However portions were not big enough to be fully satisfying."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must do thing for all Non - Vegetarian Sea Food Lovers,positive,40,17-Mar-13,I like the food.... but some might not like the rush atmosphere. But its a good experience and different kind of taste compared to many other places.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Seafood,positive,50,3/11/2017,"The best quality seafood I've ever eaten. This is a seafood lovers paradise. So much to choose from and always great quality. I can't go past the chilli or black pepper crab. A messy, finger licking feast of the best quality crab you will find. Squid, prawns, its all so good. Much pricier than your hawker food, but if your budget can manage it, give yourself a treat."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nothing great,negative,30,4/8/2017,"The decor was nothing great. We ordered the duck pancakes(1/2 a duck), xo fried rice with duck, yeong chow fried rice, hakkaw, prawn spring roles, kai Lan etc. the ladies serving were nice. The food was average for me. In a place like Singapore they really will need to turn up the game to survive. For me it was not a meal to remember!"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Perfect South Indian Gateaway,positive,40,9-Feb-18,I had been to another south indian joint for dinner the previous night and then came to Murugan Idly for lunch the next day..Murugan Idly was much better than the previous joint.

French,Saveur,Would Have been 5 stars,positive,40,5-Oct-16,"Heard about Saveur and gathered 3 friends to try the food at The Cathay outlet. Firstly there was no set lunch. To be fair, it was Monday and the menu had JUST changed. But there was set lunch available when the reservation was made. oh well. Just my luck Secondly, it seemed that 40% of the menu wasn't available- very strange. we wanted truffle fries- not available. so were the pork belly, seabass, beef short ribs, etc etcFood was good for those available dishes we ordered.was a birthday celebration for 1 of us and the staff were ok to provide a candle for 1 of the desserts. "
French,Saveur,Quality not compromised by crowd,positive,40,1-May-16,Went there on a busy Saturday evening. They seem to be running on minimal manpower. However the staff were polite and efficient. The quality of the food was great. It wasn't compromised at all.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must for foodies,positive,50,15-Aug-13,good food with varieties to choose from. have to check the price before you order any seafood items or it might turn out to be a little over your budget.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black pepper crab, yummmm",positive,40,5/9/2014,Having the famous Singapore black pepper crab at thus restaurant is a must. This venue has a vast array of seafood and all of it is very good. Prices are not the cheapest but the quality is worth it.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very reliable dim sum in the heart of Chinatown,positive,40,12/27/14,"VIsited Yum Cha numerous times and think they deserve a good review after my visit this afternoonLocation - easily accessible via train/bus as it is in the heart of Chinatown. its on 2nd floor of the hotelFood - tried both dim sum in the morning/noon as well as Chinese dinner in the evening. Good quality, and fresh. Most important - food is served piping hot. If you are on dim sum go int he morning/noon as the selection of dim sum is less on dinner session. typical fare like char siew bao, prawn dumpling, siew mai are very good.Service - very good - i love the fact that a lot of staff are middle age but still very enthusiastic and friendly.Pricing - not the cheapest in Chinatown if you compare to Tak Po, but that is a complete ballgame all together.tips : - do not be tempted to order everything in 1 go no matter how big is your group. order 1st round a few items, see what you like and order again! then you get to enjoy piping hot dim sum rather than a table-full of lukewarm dim sum. - Remember to enjoy your dim sum with a pot of hot Chinese tea.- do not be intimidated by the menu that looks very extensive especially if you are new to dim sum. there is no right or wrong way to enjoy the good Chinese meal."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Punjabi food with Tang ;-),positive,50,17-Apr-12,"Though prices are going north here too,this is one place i visit atleast once a month.With family or friends.The staff is very attentive,warm and knowledgable.During Navratra-i was fasting the staff cooked lotus stem with for me with just seasoning.Felt like home.The pani-pooris, chaats, Bhaturas, weekday buffet,Samosas or the sweets, all are just awesome.The restaurant keeps the quality under check which makes my friends/relatives from various parts of the world make atleast 1 visit every visit mandatory."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi and sashimi!,positive,50,31-Jul-14,"We were seated at the sushi bar, only 8 seats in total with two chefs. Everything is made fresh in front of you, really enjoyed the experience. Kind of ""you make it and we eat it!""The Urchin is real fresh, very tasty indeed, the chef made something with the Urchin, I will call it Urchin ""fried rice"", but not really fried...it's sushi rice mixed with fresh Urchin topped up with Ikura, what can I say other than wow, great taste so fresh and so yummy! High in cholesterol but hey, we only live once =)!If you are in Singapore I can recommend this place, sushi and sashimi doesn't get better than this, unless you are in Tokyo!Just one thing, not the most romantic setting, unless your date loves Japanese food then this is the place to go.Enjoy your meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice seafood,positive,40,6/10/2014,"From the iconic east cost place, the Dempsey venue has not lost its original character. chili crab is excellent, the black pepper one also. The diner experience is worht a visit, located on the hills, the outdoor sitting is a lovely experience, perfect for family and friends.A must do visit, to go back to without hesitation."
French,Poulet,Very tasy meal!,positive,50,11-Jul-13,"We visited the Vivocity restaurant and at first were a little turned off by the queue to get in but we were seated in 10mins. The staff were great. We went back twice as the meals were so fantastic and flavoursome as well as beeing a good price. On our first vivit we shared the Salad de Paris... AMAZING! and for mails the Poulet roti (signiture chiken dish) and the Iberico Pork Belly both were lovely! Mash potato is so creamy! The sauce of the signiture chicken is quite rich though. It was super filling and was under $45 for two of us. Tip: glasses of water are 30cents each and they are warm, if you would like it cold you need to ask for a cup of ice! We went back twice and I would go again! I highly recommend it!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak is disappointing,negative,20,12-Dec-16,Steak is no good (probably a raw material issue) but sauce is tasty. Appetizer n dessert are yummy though. House red wine taste too plain. Since the main course is key overall dining experience is below average.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Good Deal,negative,30,13-Mar-15,Getting a full fledged buffet with this amount is a good deal indeed. The buffet spread had a handsome variety. The best was matar paneer (green peas & cheese) but the rest didn't disappoint either.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Shortest Dinner At Best Food Quality Assured,positive,50,20-Mar-18,"If You're In A Rush For Meeting , Theatre Or Something Else Dining At The Bar At Waku Ghin Definitely A Good Option Food Was Great Drink List Is Remarkable Most Importantly The Service"
French,Saveur,Great location,positive,40,10-Feb-18,Great location - in the heart of Singapore. Had the Duck Confit and signature pasta. Food was delicious and service was good. Good to go early as the crowd starts coming in around 6.30pm.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great Japanese cuisine & nice ambience,positive,50,25-May-13,"A truely enjoyable Omakase (???) dinner at Shinji @ OUE. The food are exquisitely done with freshly imported ingredients from Japan. Even the garnishes are specially selected, the Shiso flowers and Okinawa shio (salt). Also not forgetting the best sake, Juyondai (???), it is ultra smooth and paired wonderfully with the cuisine. Service crews are friendly and attentive which ends the dinner perfectly. Great dining experience. The ambience at OUE Tower makes the dining experience better than at Shinji @ Raffles Hotel.Though it quite pricey, overall worth the value.PS: Hope to see the Chef will present a different surpise in the next omakase dinner."
French,Poulet,Less than mediocre; price does not match quality,negative,20,28-Jul-13,"I went here with average expectations - which unfortunately were not met. Everything on our table was sweet. The white sauce much-hyped chicken is much too sweet for our taste buds. The mashed potato is almost like creme caramel. For almost 30SGD for a main, side dish and soda, the price certainly does not match the quality. You have to pay 50cents for a warm water too - a disappointment considering that the food is already expensive as is. Do yourself a favor, and spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",the food not fresh,negative,10,7-Jan-18,the fish all is too hard and not fresh. it is weird when you eat the food with hard feeling. Fish is a soft meat. The shashimi is just ok.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is hit or miss,negative,30,15-Nov-12,"I was very excited to try this famous Indian chaat chain here in Singapore. The dahi puri was great, the chole samosa was not good. We ordered a few more dishes, they were not memorable. Overall, about 6 chaats, only one was outstanding. Very disappointing from my high expectations. The decor is great, very modern and clean. Nice dishes and good service. We won't go back, we will try some cheaper chaat places."
French,Paul,Terrible green tea macha frappe,negative,20,26-Oct-17,"Didn't read the review before I went. Had a short meeting there with a business associate. The green tea macha frappe has too much milk, no green tea. It's not drinkable. One black coffee and one frappe cost $14.71. Price on the high side."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fake Crab, low quality meats",negative,20,03/21/12,"The buffet is set up to feed the mst food to the most people at the lowest cost - not price. The use of fake crab whensurrounded by sea, offering meat products that are blends like a spam or meat bi-product do not belong in this 3 star quality hotel masquerading as a 5 star. It is easier than going across the way but it is worth it to walk across the bridge to the convention center to the food market there."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Superb South Indian Food,positive,50,15-Sep-16,"Probably one of my best - South Indian restaurant in Singapore especially Karam Idly, small Uttapam are yummy. It's value for money for the entire family to have good breakfast."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Becoming expensive overpriced & portions reducing in size !,negative,30,24-Apr-13,Used to be very good and cheap a few years back I don't mind the touting after all it's an open air hawker food centre and that's what you will get ! Definitely over priced for such small portions and the old Newton circus hawker center many years ago was much better but I must say the food is still delicious . Better find somewhere more affordable next time.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good service and generous portions.,positive,40,9-Dec-16,Not a good place if you are trying to lose weight or if your Body mass index is too high. Getting really popular and crowded.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good Indian Vegetarian Food,positive,40,17-Mar-15,Great Indian Vegetarian fast food but pricey. Opposite Mustafa's 24 hour Shopping Centre. The service is ok but the premises is clean. Free flow of drinking water. The only thing you need to help yourself to the water.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An interesting evening,positive,40,29-Jan-16,"I had previous eaten in the Hawker market in both Chinatown and Little India, however this was a difference experience. Being more little stands to chose from. My friends and I several types of food. Chinese, Indian, and Japanese. The atmosphere is really lively and lots of fun. The real plus was lots of tables with umbrellas if the weather gets wet, and a restroom with plenty of area to wash up after the somewhat messy chili crabs."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Yummy dosas,positive,50,10-Jun-12,I went there for the dosas and I will keep on going....

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant surprise,positive,40,16-May-15,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec City (Fountain area)**We found this place pretty much by accident as we were looking for a place for lunch after a fair at the Convention Centre.It was pretty busy so we figured it should be good. And it didn't disappoint.We had the lunch set (steak frites) and also a roast chicken main meal. The set was value for money as it came with salad, steak with fries, soft drink and a dessert of the day. Even though we only had a dessert, they were kind enough to let us share- giving us an extra set of cutlery without the need for asking. The prices are affordable and the food tasted good too, especially the fries! Service was quick, even though it was fairly busy - Friday lunch crowd.I would definitely go again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A perfect birthday meal,positive,50,20-Oct-15,"We went for a lunch buffet, the food was fantastic, an incredible selection and all very fresh. Unlike most buffets it is not sat around getting all dry and horrible, it comes fresh as you order so the food is lovely and hot when it gets to you. As an experienced eater of sushi, I can say the quality of the seshimi, maxi, handrolls and everything else isreally above adverage for what you would expect from an all you can eat.The staff were great too and on hand to help, were generally polite and well mannered. Thanks again, we will be back again! :)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good & tasty authentic dim-sum,positive,40,12/14/14,"Almost all the dim-sum served are delicious, steamingly hot & in perfectly big sizes.
Lots of varieties which included Chinese noodles, fried rice, seafood and hot & cold Chinese dessert."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood restaurant ,positive,40,1/8/2018,"We ordered set menu. Quantity was good enough for four pax. Black pepper crab was very nice. and bamboo clam is also delicious.
My family enjoyed good food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love it!,positive,40,11/22/11,"Having been away for more than 8 years, I am glad to see that the food here is still very good. Portions are large and the service staff are wonderful about advising you on how much to order (or in my case, not order). Restaurant is in a good location with indoor and outdoor seating. They do accept reservations, which is necessary, especially on Friday evenings and the weekends. Service is good and it is obvious the servers have been well trained to wait patiently on customers. However when the restaurant gets crowded, then service tends to be spread a bit thin."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Steak, frites, house Bordeaux, what's not to like?",positive,40,18-Oct-17,"If a restaurant is going to only do one main course, it needs to do it well. I have tried similar establishments in other cities and after many times thinking about trying here we finally got around to it.We rocked up fairly early, sans reservation but got a table easily, however, had we been later it might have been different.No need for starters, straight to the chase. The only decision to make is how you want the steak cooked. I was surprised to see ""well done"" as an option - I went to a place in HK recently who stated they would only serve their steak rare or medium rare(!) - but we requested a point, and saignant (medium and medium rare) so that was fine. There was a fair wine list, but a bottle their own label Bordeaux looked the right choice and it was pretty decent.We toyed with our green salads with walnuts, they were OK, but salad is, well, rabbit food at the best of times.The steaks arrived after a suitable interval, plated up by the wait staff in the dining room and smothered in the Cafe de Paris sauce. And a few frites. Well, to be honest, a shed-load of frites. Verging on ""American"" serving. I would have preferred fewer and when we go back, as is highly likely, I will make the point of asking for less.Both were cooked well, and how I would have expected them outside France: in France medium rare is always closer to rare than say here.After making some inroads into the food, the waitress brought the rest of the steak and offered more frites: had I not eaten for a week I might have taken her up on it as they were good frites but having only the one stomach I passed.My only minor criticism was a slight lack of seasoning, but that is always to be expected in Singapore, the salt police have declared salt is A Bad Thing so I needed a touch more on mine.There was a dessert selection and having had the house main course, and the house red, we went for the house dessert to share, a salted caramel lava cake, a la mode. There was a warning that there would be 15 minute wait for said confection but that gave us time to reflect on the meal and begin digesting it.Dessert was quite reasonable and a good way to finish.Cost was pretty fair as well, $190 all in so as I say, somewhere to add to our rotation."

It was a great place to enjoy a super nice lunch and to talk business which we did. I would definately recommend this place to others!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian food but very expensive,positive,40,20-Feb-14,Though the food and service was very good. The prices were steep as compared to nearby Indian restaurants.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",One of best Japanese restaurant,positive,50,8-Sep-14,Went to shinji last week and the food was just out of this world. The sashimi and uni were really fresh and service was impeccable. Price is of course higher than most Japanese restaurants but at least we are paying for really high quality stuff.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money,positive,40,1-Jul-15,"Went with a group of all-girl friends to the Suntec outlet. The lady manager was very friendly and joked with us. Not packed on a weekday night, so at least it's not so noisy and stressful.Price was very reasonable, with mains at only S$20. Appetizers and desserts were also decently priced. Loved the salty caramel lava cake. And the half baked chocolate cake - not too sweet like most lava cakes.Only disappointment is the Foie Gras, which was a terrain instead of the pan-fried version."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,negative,30,8-Nov-16,"If you are only here for the sashimi, its fresh, thick slice, good range of sashimi. However, other food like the grilled category/ handroll, not very nice. Nothing to rave, but i can say its for sashimi lovers."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Atmosphere,positive,40,07/24/12,Sat out side on a balmy evening. Very attentive staff who managed our large group well. Good chilli crab and a variety of spicy chicken dishes and accompaniments. Mid range for prices for food and alcoholic drinks. An enjoyable evening.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Relax, it's only food",positive,40,3-Oct-14,"Highly anticipated, our visit was a little disappointing. From the hidden entrance into an almost dark room (sigh) which is way too self conscious and makes you feel like unworthy when you for stumble blindly into the nearest chair in front of a load of snobbish casino goers to the mini-restaurant rooms with 5 bar stools (err uncomfortable, I'm spending a fortune I want a chair back and not to get varicose veins) it was all a bit much. Yes some of the food was very delicious (the beef, some other stuff) but the famous sea urchin, well I literally had to gag it down. The wine pairings were good. We paid about $1800. It's too much for what it just faffed around food. Unless you are a food blogger I'd say don't bother"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,quite decent French food,positive,40,8-May-17,Food is not bad at all. Some starters are good (foie gras terrine) and more interesting than main courses. The place can be very noisy at times.
French,Paul,Food is very good but slow service. ,negative,20,20-May-17,"ambiance is very nice. relaxing. but could have been better if they play some french music. Food is sooo good. we tried salad grilled beef and beef tartine.I ordered this chocolate drink topped with whip cream @ $7.90. I requested for it to be served cold. but it was not served with whipped cream.it looks different from the picture on the menu and nothing special on the taste. the server insisted that it does not have a whipped cream. but how come it says on the menu. and when I asked for the whip cream. i was charged additional $1.50, it should have been included on the 7.90 as its stated on the menu!! on top of that I was charged additional $2 because it was served cold and I was not informed when I ordered. I was so upset. i will keep coming back to paul as I like the food but im not coming back to this branch. i dont recommend. try other branch."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinese food ,positive,40,07/27/16,"We were looking to just have some Dim Sum for dinner in Chinatown, and decided on this one based on a combination of location (from where we were) and menu. We just ordered nine different dishes and shared everything.I especially enjoyed the Scallop Pea-shoot Dumplings and Prawn & Mango Sesame Fritters. "
French,Paul,"Nice food for a shopping mall, but a staff a bit chaotic",negative,30,11-Jan-17,"We ate at Paul in the Ngee Ann City complex on two occasions. The food was surprisingly good for a shopping mall restaurant. We shared a baguette with chicken and salad, with excellent fruit smoothies to drink. The desserts were also very good. However, the staff at the restaurant seem to be run off their feet, even mid afternoon. Whether this is due to lack of proper training or coordination, or understaffing is not clear. It was hard to get waitress' attention to procure a table, order, or pay the bill, and orders seemed to be lost or mixed up some of the time. This restaurant is still worth visiting if you are on a shopping expedition, but it could be so much better if properly managed"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,More Misses Than Hits,negative,20,8/12/2016,The signature roasted duck was fragrant and quite juicy. It was not bad but did not impress at all. Both the black pepper bun and crispy snow bun was good. The rest of the dishes was quite a disaster. 2 of items was almost uneatable: the jellyfish was too sour and the the char-siew was over burned. Service was not able to cope with the pack restaurant that afternoon. Overall it was a very disappointing lunch.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",THE BEST,positive,50,11-Jul-18,"The best food and the best experience too!!! The degustation menu was pricey but it's worth it!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Back again,positive,50,16-Nov-12,"Not sure why people do not like newton circus/food center. Great atmosphere, my wife & I have been going here for over 20 years. You can buy cheaper food I agree at food courts, but they are so bland & the cleaning is very dubious. When entering, do not sit where the first person tells you to sit, just walk around looking & what is available. Be polite they are trying to run a business in a competitive market. Normally you get 3 serve sizes to choose from. We have only ever had seafood, eg prawns on a couple of occasions, as that is expensive, but if you want tiger prawns, ask them to weigh in front of you. Garlic style is the best. My favorite is Mr Lee at stall number 46. Pepper beef. Calamari was OK but the batter was a bit thick. In the end we had 4 choices that cost $65 sg.Ice cold tiger beer @ $6.50 for a large bottle."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Best idli,positive,50,3-Jun-17,"The best idli, ven pongal, vadai, thosai with 4 different kinds of chutney are served in this little restaurant. We enjoyed every bite of our meal and to finish off we relished on their filter coffee and jigurthanda drink. Highly recommend and will definitely return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but not 'hawker prices',positive,40,20-May-17,"Given it's located close to the hotel-rich area of Orchard road, the Newton Hawker centre is one of the most famous and well tourist-ed of the hawker centers of Singapore. It is a large open air dining area with basic seats and tables. There are certainly plenty of food options but the prices are significantly higher than what you would expect for a hawker center. Vendors will approach you in an attempt to sell their wares - although unlike other SE asian hawkers, they were honest and open about the product and price. As a rough guide - small chilli crabs are about 35SD, Beers 7SD (for 667ml Tiger), Small squid entrees about 12SD. There is a number of juices and sugar cane options available.Overall this was a good option in terms of food variety, taste and quality but it wasn't cheap for the standard of dining."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic flavourful food for family!,positive,40,4-Jul-16,We had the balla papdi chaat which was excellent along with the chaat platter which was good. The naan is done nicely while the pashtoon dal makhni and diwani handi were excellent! I did not really like the hobo manchurian with gravy - in future I'll stick to the dry version. The mango lassi is lovely as was the sweet and salty lime juice! The masala chai was good and the desserts here are excellent! Nice place for a family visit. Price is around $20-30 a person.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food and service,positive,50,16-Aug-16,Food was served promptly and hot and it is very worth it. Would definitely return again in the future :)
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food but slow service,positive,40,25-Aug-17,Kailash Parbat restaurant located at Little India is a good place if you are looking out pure vegetarian Indian food. Serves a very good variety of Chats . However the service needs a little improvement as it is a bit slow. Otherwise it was a overall good experience
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Scrumptious food in no time,positive,50,16-May-17,"A little expensive but worth eating here. No stomach illness. Very light food. My personal favorites were Sambar Idli, Podi Idli, Pongal, Coffee."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money 1 for 1 buffet lunch,negative,20,22-Oct-16,We had the 1 for 1 buffet under UOB promo.. varieties is good but food was served very very slowly. Ordered the bean sprout and it took 40mins to arrive even though there are only few ppl at that time. Everything need to order via the iPad even for a cup of water and it cost $0.80. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive food!,negative,10,18-Nov-12,The food is expensive and not even that good by local standards. Tourist trap! Please avoid going to this place if possible. Hawker food in singapore is really much cheaper and better tasting at other places. One of the main draws of this place might be that it is open till late at night. But there are other alternatives available.

Small 8 seater restaurant, the chef was brilliant. Spent 1500 for 3 Pax and totally worth it. The sushi was pressed and made perfectly. Top quality ingredients. great pairing of starters. Abalone was perfect. Overall a fantastic experience and definitely worth returning again. Not as bland as Hiro and not as over the top as Waku Ghin but a place to come again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Who said Singapore has to be expensive,positive,40,23-Jul-18,I enjoy the Hawker Centre. Tiger beer $7 for a quart and then meals from about $4-50. Who said Singapore had to be expensive. Easy walk from Newton MRT. Worth a visit

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Okay,negative,30,25-Mar-17,"Went there with the 1-for-1 birthday promo. Price is worth it during the promo but I don't think I would pay the usual price. Food is alright, not fantastic. Sushi is pretty average. Was seated at a very cramped table when there were many empty tables around. Staff probably didn't want to walk and so seated all the customers nearby, putting us in very awkward close proximity."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Early Vday celebration ,negative,20,13-Feb-17,"Bit difficult to find due to surrounding renovation works. View all blocked and was brought to a horrible corner table (just because we were early). Anyway, our experience:- Bread rolls served cold. - Butter frozen. - Servers casually dressed, could do with better uniform.- Steaks were done nicely.- Frites look unappetising but tasted good.- Salad portion was nice. - Chardonnay's good. Would we visit again? Probably not. Ambience and warm hospitality were severely lacking for this $150 meal. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Please read you wont be disappointed,positive,40,23-Jun-13,I used to live around the corner form newton circus hawker center - I've probably eaten here 100 timesEnter on the bukit timah rd entrance and walk along the outside and right before the end you can turn in on your left - dont turn in but sit down there as there's a great juice stand and next door is the seafood place where you should order1) bbq sting ray2) satay but you have to walk in and find a malaysian satay stand as their satay is always tastier than the thai/chinese/indian stands as they use a better marinade3) try the oyster omlette something different but a must try if you're in singapore4) the locals say try chicken rice i think its the most overated local cuisine ive ever tried same with the chili crab a local delicacy - i would stay clear of both of them5) get a chicken fried rice 6) get a bak choy or stir fry beans to go with the sting ray and rice and satay (beef/chicken/venison get 6 of each to try)

Staff terrific along with the food. Expect to pay around $180.00 for a few dishes and drinks. Only let down is the price of beer , wine and coffee. Understand about the taxes on alcohol but $10.00 for a coffee does not make sense. Regards David B"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore food institution,positive,50,23-Apr-13,"Yes it is usually hot and humid, and by no means a high dining experience, but the chili crab is to die for (approx 30-35 SGD for a whole crab) and it is always great food. Very family friendly, and wallet friendly too. Always try the fresh lime juice to wash it all down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Rip Off/ Below Average Food,negative,10,23-Oct-14,"Unfortunately what could be a very pleasant outdoor-eating experience is ruined by the vendors. Expect to be hassled by various touts and then to be ripped off by them or a stall holder. If you choose anything with a marked price it is generally ok - although prices are no cheaper than restaurants - it is NOT street food prices. But if you choose anything by weight you will be ripped off big time. Go anywhere for street food, such as Adam Road, which is quite nearby. For seafood, head to the East Coast Seafood Centre.But avoid Newton Circus. Amazed the government haven't dome more to clean up the brazen thieves that run this place."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Some great stalls, if they were open.",negative,30,6-Jan-14,"We visited Newton Hawker Centre around 2.30pm on afternoon for a late-ish lunch. We arrived in the pouring rain to unfortunately find about 60% of the 'stalls' closed for business. We did however manage to find some hianese chicken as well as some fresh indian food, both which were very tasty and resonably priced. In saying this, prices were no substanically cheaper than some seemingly more 'upmakret' offerings in ION Orchard etc, however we understand the food at Newton was probably more authentic and more true to the Hawker experience.Was the food good? Yes. Was the value and atmosphere amazing? Not really. Would it have been better if all the stores were open? For sure.Would drop back in if passing by but would definately check out some other Hawker Centres first."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Worth it ,positive,50,23-Oct-17,"This visit was in the making for quite a few years and it did not disappoint. Over four hours, we were taken through a food journey like no other. It was not just about the food, but the making memory that was formed. We were all treated to food, drinks and service of the highest quality. I would find it hard to top this experience and would recommend it if you were planning an unforgettable night."

French,Paul,Preserved long-life UHT milk used in Paul's coffee?,negative,20,16-May-16,"When we visited the outlet, the coffee tasted odd, which we later found to be caused by the use of UHT rather fresh milk. We asked the staff about it, but they said they were instructed by their management to use UHT (we're guessing it's because it's cheaper).But they charge coffee at premium prices, so why use cheap, preserved milk? So don't expect a nice-tasting cuppa from Pauls. Resign yourself to that horrible aftertaste of UHT milk."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",We could've eaten here all day,positive,40,11-Mar-12,"Newton Circus is a great hawker's center.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),So much that is excellent let down by little things,positive,40,09/27/14,"This is now our 10th meal at Peach Blossoms, at least, since we often stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel when in Singapore. We love the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the ease of access when staying at the hotel. Everything is excellent except they let themselves down with easily fixed logistic errors.First they serve all the dishes so quickly without warming stands that you feel under pressure to eat quickly so that the dishes are still warm when consumed. All they need to do is have warming stands or to be prepared to serve dishes in a sequential order.Second, we ordered a bottle of wine and each time our glasses were empty we had to ask the waitress to serve more wine - either be more attentive, have a dedicated sommelier or place the wine bucket beside the table so you can self-serve.Prices are confident but not over the top considering the quality of the food. All in all a good dining experience that could so easily be a great dining experience if they paid more attention to the details described above.David C"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner,positive,40,23-Jun-17,This place never fail to delight with their wide menu selection and super fast service. Go for the ala-carte buffet and eat till your fill. The portion served are reasonable and the quality of the dishes are good. Really good value for money.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent Food & Service,negative,30,12-Apr-14,"It's one of the few places in Singapore that offers a considerable variety of chaat and by virtue of that, has good awareness here. However, both the food and service are pretty inconsistent - could be great one day and a downer the next. Their Chole Bhatura is probably the only dish that I've found to be good every single time I've had it. What they call Hyderabadi Biryani is more like Mint-Coriander rice, and their Paneer Khurchan is a heavily gravied dish, which shouldn't be the case.This branch is still okay but the one opposite Mustafa is a disaster. The staff is not receptive to feedback at all and can be quite indifferent and rude about it - maybe one of the reasons they don't offer a survey!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Worth every cent (all 120,000 of them!)",positive,50,16-Feb-13,"Despite its setting above a casino, Waku Ghin is one of the finest dining experiences I've had, ever, period: Ambiance. Service. Cuisine. On arrival, we saddled up to the bar for a quick drink. In response to my girlfriend's request for ""something fruity and sweet,"" the bartender thought for a brief moment before whipping up a delicious blended-blueberry something. There was alcohol in it, to be sure. But we couldn't tell what it was. A perfect drink.Dinner was prepared before us, teppanyaki style, by a single chef who tended to us for the duration of the meal. He was charming and engaging without being overbearingly chatty. Our ten courses included the following: (I missed a few items here, to be sure, as the sake flowed on... see full menu in pic below)- yellow tail- sea urchin- ocean trout with seaweed- abalone with rocket and Fregula pasta from Sardinia - lobster with bisque and tarragon - Tasmanian grass fed tenderloin aged 90 days with rocket and wasabi mustard- New Zealand red snapper- Mont Blanc with vanilla ice creamAll of it fresh and beautifully presented, yet simple: no foam bubbles anywhere to be seen! We washed ours down with a bottle of cold sake and some sparkling water. Waku Ghin is not cheap. But the (master) chef has earned his reputation and, in this case, does not fail to deliver once again. Bring your wallet and a healthy appetite! (oh and a shawl or wrap: the Aircon is quite strong!)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,So terrible very bad,negative,10,11/20/17,"We were recommended to go by our hotel concierge. We were very disappointed with the food, and the service the staff could not care less. When ordering for myself, and my husband I wanted vegetarian food this is what we asked for at the hotel. The meal was under the bean curd section but contained pork. When I asked the staff member she just smiled even laughed. I have never eaten meat in my whole life I knew something was wrong. I am so upset, and unwell due to never having meat. If you want a good resurant with vegetarian food don't go. If you want good service don't go, and if you want a good atmosphere don't go. All I can say is don't go"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Straightforward, well cooked food",positive,50,28-Sep-16,"Chose for a birthday celebration, knowing the entire family enjoys steak.Chose French Onion Soup to begin, which was delicious. Medium-rare steak very good, but more like a rare steak in Australia. The boys devoured. Great, morish French fries and for once, I didn't have to finish everyone else's. They ate them all.Desserts were all good, but not the standard of the steak frites.Quite pricey, but beef is expensive in Singapore.Good service. Will return."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good service and delicious food,positive,50,9/1/2014,"You can tell a good restaurant when it is used by locals and this one was packed. We didn't have to wait too long and it was well worth the wait, food was delicious and the sweet and sour fish was excellent. The staff work hard and are polite and served the dishes without delay. A good place to eat."
French,Angelina_MBS,cosy and relaxing,negative,30,6-Dec-16,"My friends and I were very excited to check out the highly recommended desserts and hot chocolate here, and since it was lunchtime, and they had just started offering a set lunch menu, we decided to check that out too. The set lunch was incredibly good value, with 3 courses. We tried all the mains, and they were all good! To top it off, you could enjoy your Mini Hot Chocolate as part of the set too! Just nice! I particularly liked the Butterfish. We decided to spoil ourselves with their famous cakes. The newly created Mont Blanc with coconut crisps was overly sweet, and not memorable. We all enjoyed the raspberry cake, which had good texture and balance."

Danish beer 300ml in HKG @ Sing40cents (you read that correctly, bro)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still a rip-off,negative,30,28-May-11,"Yep they haven't changed. Coming back to this place after years. Last time I was here, there was an older chinese woman throwing up on the table. In spite of the 'no touting' signs the place crawls with them. The quality of the food is average at best. It is arguably possible to have a good dinner there while beating off the touts and trying to make sure you're not getting ripped off. But why bother? There are better places in Singapore and I for one will not be coming back."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat In Kailash Parbat,positive,40,8-Jan-16,"A restaurant with history- specially for chaat , chole bature and authentic sindhi food. The gol-gappe/panipuri was very good, better than in India and so was papri,ragda-patis.Also enjoyed four types of chole bature but the paneer bature was the best. The Indian curry was average but the lachha paratha was good. The cleanliness and ambiance was very good. Convenient being next to Mustafa Indian Departmental Store.Indian sweets are really very good.The price band for food items is reasonable."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is great,negative,30,08/28/15,"Decided to bring my in-laws to this new duck outlet for dinner after knowing that the brand now has a branch here in singapore as i am a big fan of roasted duck.First impression was that the restaurant felt more like a food court. We were directed to the VIP room. The VIP room consists of 2 large tables and sadly, the other group in our room was very noisy and rowdy as its a group consisted of all men, most like colleagues. Anyway, the background music was also very loud and thus, very irritating. Called the server to ask them to turn down the volume but told me cannot be done. Asked her to get her manager and after her manager came in, he decided to lower the volume.Service is only so-so and atmosphere as well. But the duck is good in my opinion. But i expect a complete dining experience as the food here is not really cheap as well. Wanted to change the size of the dishes we ordered after they served them and we realised its too little for all of us. The server told us that we cannot do it. I was so puzzled why not as simply they could bring back the medium plate of duck and add more to it. Instead she asked me to order another medium plate which made the whole meal more expensive.If its not for the service and atmosphere, i would have given it a 4 out of 5!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere and cheap beer,negative,30,13-Apr-17,It is always packed whenever we go there. It is hit and miss with the stalls - we normally find an Indian stall and it is usually pretty good. Watch out for the rip offs but it is one of the iconic places in Singapore.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Really tasty food.,positive,50,9-Jun-14,The restaurant provides very good Indian food starting from chaats to paneer sabzi and biryani. It may seem a little costly but the food is really worth it. The ambience is also very good.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,negative,30,15-Mar-13,"After many years of eating at Newton circus, we just don't anymore. It has become far too expensive. It is a shame that it has become so commercial and expensive. We might try again soon, but at this stage it is not going to be for quite some time."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Outstanding,positive,50,12-Aug-13,"There's little else to say about Shinji. Go, pay up and be impressed. There is basically nothing to complain about and if you don't like the price you are simply in the wrong place, it is of the highest calibre from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave.The 12 piece option for lunch is more than adequate unless you are super hungry. Tuck in and enjoy and think about the credit card bill later, it is more than worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab - a must have when in Singapore,positive,40,5/6/2014,"Our friends told we had to go for Pepper crab when staying in Singapore. Based on Trip Advisor and the hotel we reserved dinner for two at the Long Beach. The food was great! The pepper crab was delicious along with asparagus and fried rice. I wish we had bread to soak up the sauce. The only negative was the service was a bit pushy for us to order more dishes than we could eat. There are better set up for groups of four or more. Still, I would go back. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Decent food court - good atmosphere,negative,30,18-Feb-16,"Decent food court that seems to specialise in seafood. Not as much of a tourist trap as expected, although not the cheapest food for hawker centre. Food was ok quality however, and lots of choice. A good stop for my first night back in Singapore!Was very busy, but there are lots of tables, so seating rarely an issue. It does have a good feeling about it though, not quite so drab and functional as some of the other hawker centres in town. Good place to get acclimatised."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Authentic South Indian Food.,positive,40,4-May-14,The food itself was tasty and reasonably priced. But ambiance needs a face lift and stools are too small for adults. Being at the juncture of Little India the location is very good. Service can also be improved.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian food!!,positive,40,2-Jun-17,Very Good option for Indian food in Little India. Taste is very good but is always crowded at Dinner times. You need to wait 15-30 minutes before you get a space.
French,Poulet,Westgate Poulet is the branch that we will stay away!,negative,10,21-Dec-14,"Having dine in many different Poulet, never had major issue with other branch. When we dine in the Westgate outlet, their food was below expectation, some of the dishes were too salty. Service was horrified, they are under staff with poor management. This is one Poulet our family will stay away. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local gem!,positive,40,2-Dec-15,"If you want some tasty, local and value for money food and a typical Singaporean experience then head to Newton hawker centre - 2 mins walk from the Newton MRT station.Lots of food stalls selling a variety of food and drinks, great place to take friends as its such a social place.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Best Meal of My Life - WOW, thanks Yoshi (Sunsuke Yoshizawa - Head Chef)",positive,50,12-Jul-16,"I was incredibly luck to get invited by a business colleague to try Shinji at Raffles. To be honest, other meals at Raffles have been unremarkable, to Shinji was truly impressive. I am also lucky I did not have to pay, the bill was over $1100 Sing for two people. We were stuffed and had two bottles of high-grade sake. The sushi was pure amazing and Head Chef Yoshi was great and incredibly attentive. Not so sure I would want to spring for a $600/person dinner, but it was one of the finest meals of my life."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tepanyaki 2.0,positive,50,30-Aug-12,"If you like (superfresh - oysters, lobster etc all are shown to you still alive) seafood this is the place to be in Singapore! But also for supertender wagyu beef. A 10 course (set)diner without being completely stuffed, some courses come from the kitchen but most are made on the tepanyaki in your private dining room. I didn't get the course after having had beef going back to a fishsoup but that's the only negative comment i can thinking off. Desert in a seperate room with comfy chairs. A great (yet expensive) experience and should you have any cash left hit the casino one floor below but better is to top it off with a digestive and a great view over Singapore in the skybar KuDeTa - all at Marina Bay Sands. You will enjoy it!"
French,Saveur,"Main dish sold out very fast, truffle mash without truffle oil",negative,30,14-Dec-16,"Overall food is not so bad. We arrived at 7pm Sunday, most of the signature main dish were sold out. We were not told that the kitchen couldn't prepare truffles mash before we ordered it. After clarified with the staff, they mentioned that the waiter earlier may be not well trained due to she is a temp and offered to compensate to us. Since she apologised sincerely, we don't mind having back the same dish without refund. Even though our dining mood was not affected, I found that it's not nice to have twice disappointment for customers 1) most of main dish sold out, 2) wrong food served, which the management can look into it to improve."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a go!,positive,40,17-Mar-14,"This place is amazing - if a little touristy. You have to give it a go! Lots and lots of stalls serving everything from fish dishes, curries, to milky tea and ice- cream. Grab a table, get a number, choose from as many stalls as you wish and the food will be brought to your stone table. Everything is outside and the atmosphere is fantastic. Really good fun."

French,L_Angelus,authentic french with fairly priced winelist,negative,30,3-Dec-13,"Good to see a restaurant that maintains the authentic French cusine instead of making the ""personal"" touch that is often seen in Singapore. Presentation of the food could improve and the service should need a bit of high-end restaurant training (they need to know what they are serving and the method of preparation when asked) but the taste was superb and the winelist impressive and faily priced. The location makes it a great place to start an evening out with french as it its right in the bar and club neighborhood."
French,Angelina_MBS,Limited Menu,negative,20,15-Feb-17,This place is more of a place for tea. Not suitable for dinner as the menu is very small. The pricing is also quite stiff. A vegetarian pasta cost $29 while barramundi cost $32. Food is average at best. They were also understaffed.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher,positive,50,19-Nov-17,"Great deal when there is a birthday voucher. Reservation went smoothly, food selection is great while sashimi is a steal."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mother's Day Dinner,positive,40,8-May-16,"This is not our first visit to this resturant. Over the years they have been able to maintain the food quality. For a buffet, the food quality is good and decently priced. Sashimi is fresh and the food selection is quite varied. One of my ""must have"" is their garlic/pepper pork skewer. For groups they usually provide a Salmon fish head as complementary dish. A small nick pick, is that it is time to update their tablet ordering system. Which is a little klunky, slow and shuts down in mid order. Service is decent but not very attentive, but all in all a good family experience. "

I had the lobsters, In order not to dirty my fingers so I decided not to eat the pincer but Terry help me to peel it. That really surprised me!! This is the first time i experienced in a restaurant that the staff do to the extra miles to peel the pincer for us. He even went around the 10 tables to help the rest of people who need help!! Really good service staff!!! Will visit again. Thank you Terry Lim "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad attitude,negative,30,3-Oct-16,"I had a reservation 3 weeks ago before I went there with my friends. I wanted to have the private room so I put down my remarks via Chope reservation system. When I was there, I told the counter staff I had a private room reservation, but they said rudely ""minimum charge for private room usage must be 450++"". It looks like they were worrying I got no money to pay for it. They continue to say ""So you still want the normal dining table reservation or not?"" I have to bear with it , not for anything else but for my friends. My point is it doesn't matter if I can't get the private room / i have to pay for the private room, It is matter that the counter staff doesn't have the basic manner towards guests.IF the owner of the restaurant happened to see this, please give some guidance to your staff on such matters. [UNLESS THE OWNER FEEL THAT THE STAFF WERE CORRECT TO TELL ME OFF.] I remembered that the counter staffs were 1 guy and 1 lady, both uniforms in black. Seems like they are restaurant manager / supervisor. Date of my visit - 30 Sep 2016."

French,L_Angelus,Superb,positive,50,23-May-13,"My hubby invited me to dinner for our 3rd wedding anniversary. L'Angelus came highly recommended by our Swiss/French friends as having an authentic French menu. Besides the high quality of French cuisine, we were especially impressed by the immaculate service that Thierry (Directeur De Salle) provided. He received at the entrance upon our arrival and immediately ushered us to the best table in the house, private yet unsecluded. Throughout the entire dinner, he always ensured that we had everything we needed and there was literally no waiting time for arrive or food.Heading a 2-men service team in a full house, it was truly no easy feat to keep the diners happy and satisfied in which Thierry succeeded very well.It was truly a magnifique dining experience for our romantic anniversary dinner. We will definitely be back again!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive but good atmosphere,positive,40,3-Jun-15,"Newton Food Centre also widely known in Singapore as Newton Circus is one of Singapore's more famous hawker centres, it is as popular with tourists as it is with locals. Home to seafood eateries and iconic hawkers like Kwee Heng and Hup Kee fried oyster omelette, While some may find the occasional food tout off-putting, it’s probably the only food centre where you can call ahead to reserve a table with your regular go-to seafood stall and have them attend to you. For beginners, don’t feel obligated to order from the hawker who got you a table, simply decline politely. If you are ordering seafood, watch them weigh it in front of you to avoid a surprise bill. Keep an eye out for the busy lunch crowds, happy family gatherings, and inebriated youngsters starving for some post-clubbing grub. It’s also common to see vendors touting all kinds of food, so walk right on by without making eye contact if you don’t want to be accosted. When you’re here, do order the famous chilli crab and barbecued seafood, and sample a veritable slew of other local delicacies. More than just a hawker centre, the variety of good food and unique atmosphere makes any meal at Newton an experience to remember. This is also a great place to people-watch. It is more expensive than other hawker centres but the atmosphere makes up for it."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice buffet,positive,40,26-Mar-17,"Not my first time here, but good food as usual. Sashimi seemed slightly less tasty as before, but the rest of the dishes were great."

Its very good for basic yum cha/dim sum - steamed dumplings, wantons, spring rolls, rice rolls, congee and rice and noodles. The service is ""brisk"" and its pretty cheap and cheerful kind of place with less of the ""cheap"". It is moderately expensive for what it provides."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful,positive,50,7/4/2015,"One of the best Yum Cha's i have had, great food and service. Well priced and good variety of dishes. really easy and fresh."
French,Paul,Letting the name of paul down with terrible service,negative,10,14-Feb-15,The kitchen just do not seem to understand that two people eating want to eat at the same time. Went here 6 weeks ago and my wife was served her food after I had finished mine. We tried again today and to make it simple we ordered the same simple meal. Hers arrived and I was assured mine was on the way. 15 mins later my wife had finished and mine still not arrived. I eventually got up and told the waitress to forget it as I was going to eat somewhere else. When she came with the bill it still had both meals on it. Will never eat here again and I think paul head office needs to sent someone quickly to sort this place out.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Not so nice food,negative,30,09/28/14,"The foods are blunt.the dumplings look so aweful. But to be fair, service was quite ok so im giving it an average rating"
French,Poulet,Not too bad,negative,30,10-Jul-13,"I visited the one in Vivo City. I passed by it one day and there was a long queue, so I thought it must be good. Agreed with the previous reviewer that it could be too salty for some. I tried the Potato and Mushroom soup and the 'signature chicken"". I personally find that it's quite alright but not worth the queue i witnessed. The service was quite good though."

Atmosphere was pleasant and service staff were attentive , friendly and very helpful . The food is good and too certain dishes are worth mentioning - like especially their cod fish slices in chinese wine, beef cubes with lychee , beancurd with seafood in claypot . You can even choose the menu items on line and so makes planning for a bigger party easier and less stressful ; they will also offer suggestions through the same medium . Prices are reasonable and if you have their Lifestyle membership card , you can obtain further discounts. would certainly return if i want a dinner for special occasions"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food and great prices,positive,40,9-May-16,"Don't come here just for the seafood. Eat what the locals eat! You can barely see locals ordering seafood here, so look around the tables to get an idea of what to eat.Some recommendations that won't break the bank will be oyster omelette, prawn noodles with soup, fish soup noodles, fried prawn noodles, fried noodles (char kway teow) and shaved ice to top it off!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Must try 3 meat combination !,positive,50,4/5/2017,"We were back there again at their outlet in Vivocity, this time for lunch. My friend was there ahead, so she took a table for 3 of us.Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for a weekday lunch. Service is as usual good and efficient.She has never tried it here, so we ordered our usual favorites, a quarter roast duck and some dim sum. She also wanted to try the other 2 meats, roast pork and char siew. Wow ! The char siew was moist, tender, succulent and tasty ! The roast pork too, n not too saltish ! She also agreed with our verdict of the London Fat roast duck : a ravishing delight.She even brought home the meats, which we couldn't finish. Her parents liked them so much, and said...Not enough for them. LOL.Will be back, to satisfy our craving for roast meats !"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",What's the fuss about !!!!,negative,20,21-Feb-16,Average food and pathetic service sums up this place aptly !! I am not sure why it's regarded as one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore - most dishes taste stale!! Freshness is something that is not offered on their menu and so is the service. Servers seem to have been forced to work.Give this place a miss and try out loads of better ones during your next visit to Singapore. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent chaat house,negative,30,15-Dec-14,"We were craving for chaat. Our son recommended we try their recent one opened at Syed Alwi Road. Chaat platter covered everything we needed and salted lassi - was just right.We were tempted by a promotion, which the waiter said was for just this week at Mon to Fri lunch only - Punjabi Dhaaba - Sarson ka saag with makai di roti. That was a disaster!I messaged my son - chaat was very good but saag roti failed! His reply. ""You failed for having fallen for it in a Bombay chaat house"".My response, ""I should have known better, they had a disclaimer on the picture on the table promo 'presentation only for illustration purposes'. Saag seemed canned and makai roti mixed with white flour - not fit for human consumption. We should have stuck to chaat."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Spoilt for choice,positive,40,30-Oct-15,"We came here on the recommendation of a colleague from Singapore. Having stayed at a hotel for a three day work do and not seen much else than the hotel we were keen to use the last remaining hours before our flight back to the UK seeing and tasting the real Singapore. The main problem we were faced with on arrival was the vast choice! Hunger built as we browsed the stalls and took in the sights and smells of pad thai, laksa, curries, crispy duck, satay and lots and lots of other local delicacies. We settled on some thai food that looked super-fresh, pad thai easily the best I've ever had and a green papaya salad not far behind. It's all very basic with paper plates and plastic cutlery, you drink your coke straight from the can, but the food is the main attraction and well worth the $15 cab fare. After a big gala dinner the night before we were also relieved to find it was the best hangover cure ever!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",the food is good but service extremely poor,negative,30,29-Aug-18,"As I entered the restaurant I was escorted to my table and served with water.the person who came to take the order was least bothered and was busy chit chatting with another client. We ordered our food first we received a dish that was not for us. He placed the platter and then apologized saying it was not for us. he again said it was for us, we checked and told him it wasn't then again he apologized. (was a very casual apology though). After a few minutes again he got us some food which was not hours and again we told him and then he went to another table. and finally our food arrived. The taste was good, nothing great but good food. The juice came flat and we had to tell him to get ice. normally they should ask while ordering. When we left again no smiles. above all this the restaurant had around 100 people capacity but there were only 8 guests including us so imagine this mess with 4 serving staffs. imagine with more clients. finally we went out and ate a busy food joint which was ananda bhavan trust me had great food !!! There is another restaurant called gokul which is also a good indian restaurant nearby"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So So...,negative,30,10-Nov-17,"Food was average, service was less than average. Tori skewer was cannot make it at all.. taste dry and not much of flavouring."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Muthu's Curry,positive,40,6-Nov-17,Went here for dinner. Their specialty is the fish head curry however we opted to have the butter chicken and the chilly crab. The food had a lot of flavor & was delicious. They offer you a bowl of papadams along with your meal.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",horrible service and food,negative,10,18-Jun-16,"no care for the customers , only interested in collecting money . went with friends and lot of hopes but really disappointed . my first and last visit there"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food Service was slowly after first hour,negative,30,24-Aug-18,"This was a buffet A La Carte lunch... In the beginning the food service was ok.. As you ordered thru the ipad system, the food arrives about 5 - 7 time.. However after the first hour... The waiting period became longer and longer.. We ordered some dishes like tempura but it never came.. Even after spoke to the Waitress / Supervisor.. She said she tried to check our orders a few times.. But nothing happens.. It was so disappointing.. No one offered any apologies. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A evening dinner,negative,30,11-Apr-18,"Very good service from the beginning to the end of the dinner, really nice atmosphere and ok location. The food was ok but not special. The prices not too bad. But all in all a positive evening."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Veg (Jain) Option opposite Mustafa, Little India",negative,30,12-Nov-15,"This is a typical restaurant like we have back home (Mumbai, India). I have been there couple of times just for the craving of chaats and this is one of the few Jain food options in Singapore. Except for the taste of Indian food (almost all items) and the sweets, I did not find anything great about this place. Place looks to little cramped, and it turns out to be too noisy when full. We (6 of us) were given a table which was joint with another table for capacity of 4, so it felt like we were together and sharing meals :). Service is worse, they cannot manage when the crowd is full and the frustration will come out on one of us if we are unlucky when we ask them for an additional service like providing glasses to drink water. I believe it was a bad day for us. They messed with orders; getting some other item instead of what was ordered. And yes, cost is little on the higher side compared to other restaurants.PS: This review is for the branch they have opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road. I am not sure if Kailash Parbat has any other branch in Singapore. I have seen there are reviews for Serangoon Road Branch as well, so they might have other branch there."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb each time,positive,50,22-Apr-13,"My 3rd visit to Shinji and the experience always brings a smile to my face each time. They have a main dining area and a smaller one, and this time, i got a space at the cosier smaller section. Opted for my usual 12 pc lunch set (they have 9 pc, 15 pc and a OMG omakase set). Service was fantastic as usual, from the waitress to the sushi chef. The chef though japanese, helpfully said each piece of sushi in japanese and english, so that we can learn along the way too. Each piece was delicate and delicious, especially the 3 types of tuna, the uni, the unagi and egg. Even the miso soup you can tell was lovingly made and tasted good. Dessert was pineapple from okinawa (wow) with jelly. Fully booked again for lunch so do call ahead for reservations. 1 of the best japanese joints in south east asia, believe the majority here, it is that good. 1 reviewer who wanted to stand out gave Shinji a poor (2 star) rating and i was offended by everything he or she said"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Premium (and fresh) ingredients,positive,40,30-Jul-16,"Enjoyed our dinner at Waku Ghin. Started at 530pm and ended just before 8. Food gets served pretty quickly which was even better for me since I get reallyimpatient waiting. Don't think that they are too strict with dress code as the couple next to us wore tshirt, jeans and sneakers. Very meticulous team, they give you a copy of their menu after your meal and I was very surprised that they edited the title of my second dish (I'm allergic to raw crustaceans so I didn't have raw shrimps with my uni). They charge a bit differently for water, instead of charging per bottle they go by $20 per person for still water (so drink more guys haha)! In terms of taste, above average, but I'm giving the experience 4/5 as the price of the meal was on par with the ingredients used (uni, tuna, king crab, lobster, abalone, wagyu) - very worth it!"
French,Saveur,Always so yummy,positive,40,20-Feb-17,"First time at the Cathay outlet. We ordered the Saveur pasta (it is never complete if you did not order this), mushroom soup, seabass and steak frites (medium rare). ALL were super good. Highly recommend the seabass and steak. I am still drooling typing this."
French,L_Angelus,More of casual dining experience,negative,30,18-Nov-13,"It was my 1st time visiting L'Angelus, not quite high expectations but given the reviews i've read, was expecting something better.Deco is simple and it was fulled house on friday night so it was pretty noisy and the tables were pretty close to each other which has no privacy at all.Appetizer - started off with Escargots, this is kind of unique as it had a layer of crunchy bread with garlic butter on top of the escargots. It was nice but my friend and i felt it was too salty.Main - i had ribeye medium rare and the condiment was potato gratin, these 2 dishes were rather mediocre. My friend had lamb and she said nothing fantasticDesserts - Chocolate Lava cake, this was 1 of the best that i had. Have to give credits to the chef, the cake cast was thin and soft, taste and aroma of chocolate just made everything perfect. However, the crepes suzette was disappointment. It was dry and the pancakes were kind of thick, the presentation wasnt appetizing too.Overall - Would only go back for the chocolate lava cake. If your a couple looking for quiet, romantic place then this is not advisable."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Boring place,negative,20,28-Aug-15,"They just served entrecotte. It's not bad, but the last time i was there the price was higher, so I'm not coming back anymore."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good service but food is not value for money,negative,30,19-Nov-16,Their mains are expensive and comes in a very small portion. Note that I'm already a small eater. Also it taste normal nothing fantastic. You can find lot of cheaper and taster meal elsewhere. Their cakes are good though but tad expensive. Average $12 excluding gst and service charge. Frankly I won't go back again even though the service was really good.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Amazing idlis,positive,50,3-Jun-16,"It's a great place to visit for some very soft and delicious idlis.
Served with 4 types of chutni, the idlis are a delight to have.
Must try for anyone who likes South Indian food"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Lovely food, cheerful staff",positive,40,08/26/17,"Thanks for the lovely time given to my family and my wife for her birthday, the Wagyu rib with Black Truffle was amazing. But the presentation of the cake really 'takes the cake'! Appreciate the staff (Terry, Nobel, Sok Teng and especially Christine) that made this day special *thumbs-up*"
French,Saveur,Will not pay a second visit,negative,30,12-Feb-17,"The service was quite terrible during our visit. No one was trying to serve us until we ask for it. I personally walk to the counter to order food as the stuffs pretend not seeing me when I raise my hand. Plus, no one was trying to entertain us when we first step into the restaurant. Food quality was average and nothing to be impressed. Will not pay my second visit to this restaurant. "
French,L_Angelus,Great french food,positive,50,23-Nov-11,"The Chateaubriand carved at the table and potatoes dauphinoise that came with it were amazing! As were the blinis with caviar. The service was very good, wine was always topped up and even though we arrived quite late were not rushed at all. The wine list is good and really there is nothing to complain about. The place has a laid back homey feel feel to it so it is comfortable even if you are not dressed to nines. I went with a visiting friend and she is still a month later emailing about how great it was! I think its good for dates, with friends and groups and because the food is so good, also for business dinners."
French,Saveur,Nice quiet(er) date,positive,40,19-Nov-16,"Had a nice date with my boyfriend, there was 50% discount off the starters. Unfortunately, they didn't give me the discount (I found out only a day later).We ordered the mushroom soup and Saveur Pasta as starters, which both were good. The Beef Short Ribs was small, but surprisingly filling. My boyfriend could not finish the steak. We topped it off with pistachio panna cotta which is good for sharing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoy variety of food here,positive,40,24-Mar-15,"Just you get out of Newton MRT station, you will find this eating place. A big complex where on all four sides small stalls sale all kind of food. Local, Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Korien, Thai, Indian .... Soft drinks, beer, and water can be purchased with your food. Clean atmosphere, tasty food. Indian vegetarian food was also available here."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Yummy idly,positive,50,15-Jan-15,truly feel great by eating Murugan Idli . Best taste with price tag. truly felt I am eating the idly in india. Must try if you are in Singapore. Thumbs up
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great food and personal service,positive,50,8/8/2016,Had dim sum there on Sunday. Service and food was great despot it being a busy day! The manager Alden and his staff know their stuff. 
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Nice & delicious food,positive,40,22-Apr-16,"Very good South Indian food, tasty and also very reasonably priced as well. We ordered idly, dosa, onion uthappam & vada. All the items were good."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic South Indian Idlis....,positive,40,3-Nov-11,"This is THE place in Singapore to have authentic South Indian idli sambar and other dishes. Not the cleanest of elegant of places, but serve great food."
French,Angelina_MBS,Superb afternoon tea,positive,50,11-Apr-16,"Excellent service, good food! Praticularly the foie gras. The pastries were good but not extraordinary but the full experience was superb. This is the only Angelina outside France, take advantage and bisit Angelina SG!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dinner and Cocktail at the Bar,negative,30,12-Mar-16,"We started with mojitos carefully prepared and offering a very refreshing start to dinner. For starters we had the Aburi Tasmanian petuna ocean trout with a hint of chili and the Lobster sandwich. They were good and refreshing though calling it the Lobster sandwich a sandwich was a total misunderstanding of the word sandwich. It was just lobster meat in a bisque with two pieces of toasted bread on the side.Next came the Spaghetti with lobster and Spaghetti with king crab. They were both good but unexciting, with no highlights to stimulate our taste buds. They could use a better quality of pasta. The third movement came with Grilled wagyu beef on rice, a very tasty and favoursome offering and the Marinated tuna (Tonbo) set on seasoned rice. Compared with the Grill beef rice, this was really a let down. The seasoned rice is dominated by the vinegar used in the seasoning. The rice was too mushy for our taste. For drinks, we had Negroni, Waku Ghin martini and a Waku Ghin citrus. All tasty and exciting drinks to go with the food. However what stand out is the baby peach cured in truffle oil. An excellent accompaniment to the martini. Each bite explodes with favours. However, there was one on the mushy side, indicating a spoilt baby.They were many service staff but no one opened the doors for us. But finally made up for in the send off.Summary out of 10 points:Food 6, Bar List 8, Ambience 7, Food Value 5, Cocktail Value 6"
French,Paul,What is Happening Currently,negative,30,20-Feb-16,"It is indeed sad that a cafe of this reputation is not able to keep up to the expectations of customers. With the shortage of labour every food and beverage establishment is facing, it does not seem like improvements to the lack of quality service are going to happen anytime soon. What a shame.Despite the situation, we have always wanted to try out this name brand since we missed the opportunity back when we were in Paris a few years ago. Now that we have, we are somewhat satisfied.The queue did not take long to subside and we got to sit at a table along the passageway. We could peer through the glass panel straight at the cash register. Perhaps it would be wise to have a ceiling-to-wall curtain to block off the view from customers. The menu was comprehensive and had photos to aid the customers and the portions are fairly large for their prices. My partner and I had a turkey ham and cheese sandwich to share and ordered separate mains. Desserts are the highlights here and we ordered the strawberry mille-feuille, light and fluffy. Sweet endings!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Snacks,positive,40,11/9/2017,"Had a voucher to be utilised at Marina Mandarin, so decided to splurge on dim sum. Service was fast, the prices are not cheap but the food tasted good. Had vegetarian options (thank you!!) and requests to remove spring onion were entertained."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not existing anymore?? ,negative,10,6-Jan-15,Me and my fiance tried to find this restaurant for like half an hour and we could not find it. Probably they have closed down? we went to Vino Rosso instead and it was a good substitute.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,40,27-Feb-14,"Excellent Indian food, never disappointing. Prices are slightly expensive, but we dont mind as food quality is amazing. We are regular customers here"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, great atmosphere, great fun!!",positive,50,13-Jan-12,"We went to this place twice a couple of weeks back. Saturday night is great fun with lots of people getting down for a feed. You can get cheap eats as well as tasty (but more expensive) seafood. Just for people watching alone its worth a visit.We walked around on the first night and were stopped by one lady who was probably one of the best saleswomen I've ever come across! She got her cook to whip up some awesome chilli crab and veggies.It wasn't super cheap but it was super tasty. The second time we went back we ended up going to her again and she looked after us really well, cooking up some thai style sea bass.I dont know her name or stall number but if you approach from newton MRT station you cross over the pedestrian bridge to get to newton hawker centre, when you enter via the bridge, turn right and walk up beside the stalls, after about 15-20 stalls you'll probably get stopped by this woman. She's great!Happy eating!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good value for a family,positive,40,31-Dec-17,"This Centre is a few minutes walk from the Newton MRT station. We found the food fresh, tasty and very good value. We explained that our Coeliac son had to have gluten free food and the lady sourced dishes from a few stalls for him. Cheapest meal we had in Singapore!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't bother,negative,10,29-Oct-12,"From the moment you arrive you are pestered by store owners desperate for you to try their chilli crab or swordfish. Each store holder will try to convince you that the tables near their store are theirs (which obviously they aren't) and force you to sit with one of their menus.The food is overpriced and available much more cheaply elsewhere. It's quality is dubious and generally much lower than what you will find a Food Repulic or Kopitan in a shopping centre.I believe the problem with Newton Circus is that green tourists staying in Orchard Road hear about it and head there where they are easily manipulated into paying through the nose for second rate food.My advice: get on the MRT to Raffles Place and head to Lau Pa Sat Pavillion. Cheaper, better and far more authentic."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best dim sum meals I’ve had ,positive,50,01/20/18,"A friend in Singapore recommended this place and I wasn’t disappointed. They kept bringing round dim sum on trolleys and it was very reasonably priced, spacious and air conditioned. Definitely worth the short wait to get in."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still love India Palace,positive,40,18-Aug-18,"Been to Newton Hawker at least 10 times over the last 4 years. Continue to love the food from India Palace. Always great. My daughter’s favourite Indian food in Singapore and high on my list as well.If you go to Newton, watch out for ordering from the seafood restaurants that charge by the 100 grams. You can get left with a huge bill. Stick with the set menu prices.And also be sure to check out the microbrew stalls. Good pints!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good burger, so-so steak",negative,30,22-Dec-13,"It was either this, or Wendy's. Loved the fries, steak was not that great, burger was juicy. Will probably come again, if Wendy's was the other choice."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,positive,40,04/21/16,All I can say is they serve the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore hands down! The place can get real busy but it will definitely be worth the wait. Big plus for me was the Filipina who manages the table bookings. She got us a table inside where it was cooler. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","do not care about money, just care about.. products and quality",positive,50,21-Jun-11,"I am going there every months or almost... been to many restaurants in Singapore and abroad ( I am an expat..) but Waku Ghin is ""very special"". The best products, individual rooms, friendly staff, so what more you could expect ? and for the one who complain about the bill... my answer, don't go ! by the way, if you go to good restaurants in Europe, it will cost you much more !"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Excellent place for a quick snack!,positive,40,13-Feb-16,"Murugan idli started off as a small shop in a smalltown in South India and it has now grown far and wide; all credit to the founder and the team.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good spread variety,negative,30,20-Jun-17,The variety is huge with good range of raw and cooked food. Overall the quality of food is quite good. However I was disappointed the buffet does not come with drink and dessert.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Gol Gappe,positive,40,6-Jul-15,Kailsah parbat is one safe place to fall back to when you want excellent spicy traditional north indian food. We have been there couple of times to have food and sometimes just to satisfy the craving for gol gappe. The starters as well as chat is very yum. No wonder the place is always crowded.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great Curry,positive,50,28-Mar-12,"I visited the Dempsey Hill location. A nice area, away from the hubbub of Orchard and the CBD. A relaxing meal with nice flavor. I gave up my resistance to Fish Head Curry and am glad I did.More"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Excellent food,positive,50,29-Aug-16,"Food was amazing.
Had biryani and paneer kadhai, very good authentic Indian restaurants.
Average 30-35SGD$ for couples"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,old fashion dim sum with push carts,positive,50,01/31/16,Was delighted to find that this dimsum restaurant has pushcarts. Rather than ordering from a menu you get to order the old fashioned way from old women pushing the carts of hot dimsum around. This plae looks like a blast from the past -- like the dimsum restaurants I remember when I was a child
French,Paul,Better to take away,negative,20,6-Sep-17,"It was a weekday lunch time, around 1:00pm. I ordered a set lunch and a glass of orange juice. They didn't serve me anything for half an hour, not even the orange juice nor the starter salad. So I told one of the service staff that I hadn't received anything yet. He went to check with the kitchen, and came back, saying my order wrong. I told him my order again, but I didn't receive anything for another 15 minutes. So I cancelled my order and left. I like their bread and pastries there though, so it's faster and better to take away your food from the cashier, though the staff at the cashier is also slow and unfriendly sometimes."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fabulous Food,positive,50,5-Mar-16,Highly recommend we didn't know what to order but the lovely waiter made suggestions which we were happy to go along with. Amazing !! Don't bother to have wine or beer. It's warm and overpriced Food excellent tho !
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Best 'melt in the mouth' idlis in the world!,positive,50,10-Aug-14,"Murugan here continues the timeless traditions from Madurai and Chennai in offering the best idlis on this planet.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below average quality,negative,20,7-May-17,"I booked dinner and paid about $106 for Jap buffet for 2pax. Firstly service was quite slow, given the fully packed restaurant. The cooked food was very average, and we didn't order more than we usually would have. The portions of cooked food was a little off, some came in just one piece, but some was too big a portion even for 2 pax, just like the kimichi bean sprouts dish. The sashimi was thickly sliced and seemed to be out of the fridge for awhile. But to be fair, it wasn't not fresh, but definitely not my idea of fresh sashimi just out from the fridge. We had 2 wrong orders given amidst the overwhelming crowd. Overall okay experience, but will not return for awhile. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A pretty big disappointment,negative,20,14-Jun-17,"I was very disappointed at the very least. Fresh sashimi was what attracted me to the buffet but it certainly wasn't very fresh. The tuna was fishy and the other sashimi was average at best. The cooked food and grilled items, I didn't even order twice and I usually really love grilled items. The best items were the chawanmushi (very silky) and the mini soft shell crabs. Went there on a 1 for 1 special deal but wouldn't go for a similar offer."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Weekend buffet lunch,positive,40,3-Mar-17,"Book a table of 5 for weekend lunch. Was the first to go into the restaurant. Order some food thru the tablet. But some food never came. Notice other diner also had this problem. When we ask a few time about the order some, some dishes told were sold out. And after few rounds of checking the dishes came out. Other dishes were serve promptly. The Kani crab and toufu dishes were the ones that told 1.5 hr and was not serve despite many round of asking and checking with the staff. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Many visitors come for local foods,negative,30,18-Mar-13,"Many staffs, different kind of foods, near ochard area , expensive and mainly for tourist! Different staffs with different standards. You must ask how much the price especially for sea food stalls. Some times cost a lot because the charge by weight , like fish , prawn , crab and etc.If the stall is long queue , normally , the food is nice!So, open your eye to observe, your nose to smell,.. and may ask your friends! Enoyed your food !!!! Good luck :-} Sun"
French,L_Angelus,Looking for an authentic French restaurant in Singapore? Simply the best!,positive,50,11-Aug-12,"Everything is perfect from the decor to the food to the ambiance... Take a special look at the walls covered of photos of French actors and famous French plays! As for the food, it's how it's supposed to be done! Even in France, it's difficult to find a better place for traditional French cuisine! "
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Improvement needed.,negative,30,12-Mar-17,"For the cost of food here, they really need to improve the quality n process of cooking. Not fresh snacks or coffee for the price paid."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The best stingray and prawns at Denmark stall no 49,positive,50,23-Jul-18,"Every year without fail , I must visit this place. It has the best of everything.

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Nice food,positive,50,12-Apr-16,We were hungry and looking for a good restaurant. We came across this hotel and was clean and tidy. It gives dosas and other south indian food. Chutneys were very good. Would be a sure place for brakfast.
French,Paul,"Tourist don't go, Singaporean don't bother, Ngee Ann basement offer better food",negative,10,6-May-12,"I heard of this restaurant from my friends 8 months back. Decided to try it.Initially I thought that the restaurant was very nice with the queue. Only to realised that they actually kept the tables empty to create the queue.Google ""Paul Bakery Hungrygowhere"" you'll probably find more negative comments on the Paul Bakery.Things that went really wrong:- coffee was way too acidic- chocolate cake was worse than me making a brownie instant mix. I'm not kidding- creme brulee taste worse than instant mix as well- crepes was average- service is really badSummary it's a place that looked European but serve really lousy desserts. Menu looks nice but it don't taste nice at all. Totally disappointment, spend SGD 42. I'll probably feel happier spend that amount in Ngee Ann City Basement.I'm writing this review because it's definitely NOT worth the visit and the high review on Trip Advisor is totally misleading. If I'm the tourist, I'll be totally pissed off if I tried this place. Singaporean, please just go to basement, the food there MUCH better than this place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi,positive,40,19-Apr-16,"Went here the second time last night. It did not dissappoint. Sashimi as always was fresh and the portions were just like ala carte portions. Their robotayakis was impressive. Makis were just so so. Service was superb. They should check the tablets, they dont seem to work at the right moment. Over all i would recommend this place. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Friendly staff Amazing food,positive,40,15-Jun-15,Fabulous restaurant very exspensive but great for a very special treat The staff are so friendly and helpful especially the sommelier who didn't overwhelm us with the prices of wine and selected a good Wine at a reasonable price The food is amazing and prepared freshly in front of you I would defiantly recommend this restaurant
French,Paul,Waste of time,negative,10,12-Jan-17,"Too much pretense! Service took ages, and the quality of simple breakfast was not good. To add insult to injury the coffee is really bad! It looks nice, but avoid; the are so many good breakfast places to go to as alternative."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What a taxi driver would recommend,negative,30,30-Mar-14,"9 out of 10 times when I hop on a taxi and ask the driver to bring me to a hawker centre, they would recommend Newton Circus. Later I found out why from my Singaporean friends - (i) for tourists, this place can't go too wrong - it is big, with different varieties of food; and (ii) the driver can always pick up someone from there. It's actually not bad, but the food is more expensive than other hawker centres, and especially for seafood, the menu has no fixed price and if you're not a local, you'll certainly be ripped off. There are a lot of local hawker centres. You just need to ask your Singaporean friends, not taxi drivers."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Embience. Delicious Food. Good Service.,positive,50,9/3/2017,"Nothing to complain about. Everything was perfect. Our friends were happy. Manager Terry was calm & experienced, he knew what to recommend (we were with our Taiwanese friends) & how much to order. Everyone liked the recommendations. The portions were generous. Food was really good. Excellent. Thank you Terry."
French,Paul,The worst place ever,negative,10,27-Mar-18,"I ordered a seafood pasta and one juice for lunch. It took more than 40 minutes for them to serve one dish to a guy who came before me. What's worse, they forgot my order and I had to wait another 20 minutes. I asked them about my food for 3 times but no one came back and told me how long will it take. They were extremely unfriendly and looked unprofessional.Some clams had sand in it and pasta was overcooked.It was the worst restaurant in SG and I will never visit the place again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Like the restaurant at the end of the universe..,positive,50,6-Jul-14,".. the Lobster waved before heading to its culinary execution. Proving how fresh the food was. At the start chef shows you the selection of seafood that will be served. As an Omakase meal you get what is served but as in the case of my wife they check for allergies or dislikes. The food was exceptionally prepared - here is the run down of what we had:French Gillardeau Oyster with Ginger and Rice wine Vinegar.anMarinated Botan Shrimp and Sea urchin and Oscietra Caviarslow-cooked NZ John Dory with charcoal grilled aubergineTamanian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato - mmm best Abalone I've had in Singapore and from sustainable sources from TasmaniaCharcoal grilled fillet of Tasmanian grass-fed beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi mustard (beef from Cape Grim)Ohmi Wagyu from Shiga prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy (hand grated wasabi)Somen with Myoga and JunsaiGyokuro (green tea to clear palate)Desserts: musk melon, chocolate Mousse, Petit FoursI also asked for wine pairing which was an extra 250 dollars but complimented the food nicely, includes sake. The stand out dish for me was teh sea urchin - i usually don't like and Abalone - never had a fresh one before.they also kindly made the mousse into a mini birthday cake with hand written chocolate message for my lovely wife's birthday."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Sunday Yum Cha,positive,40,08/25/15,Our visiting Australian is crazy on Yum Chas but only likes the ones that has trolley service. Yum Cha Restaurant in China town is one such place that offers a trolley service but only on weekends. we got there about `215 in the afternoon and the wait was about 15 mins. once we got a table the trolleys were there and it seemed as though they were in a hurry to get you out as soon as possible. all up the quality of the Yum Cha was good and there were a few items not seen on the traditional Yum cha menu. all up very good and $15 corkage fee for a bottle of wine was not to bad. will go again.
French,Poulet,Tasty French cuisines with a decent setting,positive,40,1-Oct-14,The signature roast chicken with cream based sauce was amazing. The staff were pretty friendly and the food came in within a reasonable time. All in all it was a very pleasing experience and we would go there again for a nice and pleasant meal which doesn't cost a fortune.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Organised Chaos,positive,50,2-Jun-15,"We went here at about 9:30pm last Thursday night and it was still pretty busy at that time. To get here you catch the MRT to Newton station, take the right hand exit and then turn left out of the station and over the bridge across the road.When you first walk in it can be a bit overwhelming, so I suggest just taking 5 minutes to do a lap of the place and get your bearings. you'll quickly figure out that a lot of the places are selling similar food. We ate at stall 70 (Mrs Tan) and the food was great (was nice to try stingray for the first time!). There is a beer stall next door where you can get some decent priced Tiger Beer and my wife really enjoyed the apple cider too.When dealing with Newton Circus you just need to be prepared to have the touts waving their menu's in your face, each one giving you the quick spiel as you walk past but just keep on walking until you find one you are comfortable with. We really enjoyed the experience and it was good to have a break from the expensive restaurants in the quays. We actually went back for an early lunch a couple of days later at midday on Saturday but most of the stalls were closed."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just ok,negative,30,03/28/18,"Just an ok experience - didn't have a record of our reservation when we arrived, seated us at a table that was essentially in a stair well, and food was just ok. Deep fried baby octopus was not good, will be going to Jumbo for those in future. Pepper crab and chili crab good, noodles just ok. Disappointing experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting concept,positive,50,20-Nov-14,"The concept of the restaurant is that you sort of have your own personal chef who caters to your culinary needs. Unfortunately if you are only two you will be seated with strangers, so if privacy is an issue you should probably take it up with management beforehand. The young chef was knowledgeable and combined service with excellent cooking. The menu is varied. The chef explained the concept is French cuisine with a Japanese twist, but for my western taste it seemed more Japanese to me. I loved their sea urchin creation and could eat easily ten of them. You can enjoy a laser show during dessert if you get the timing right, the laser show was at 21:00."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive but so worth it,positive,50,12-Nov-17,This is definitely a bucket list experience. You feel like royalty from the moment you check in and the evening just keeps getting better as the night wears on. The food is incredible and the staff really help keep the drama alive - making time to show you the fresh produce and describe it and allow time for photos. We also added in the matching wines and we are so glad that we did - it just completed the experience beautifully. The completion of the meal in another area of the restaurant was a gorgeous finale.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Price on higher side but great steaks,positive,40,16-Jul-17,"Steak was great. Good and friendly service. Price is on higher side.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Chhole Bhature,positive,40,27-Jan-15,"We often visit KP at Serangoon road (next to the indian temple between little India and farrer park MRT). This outlet is better than the one opposite mustafa in terms of ambience, quality, taste and quantity served.They serve great chat items (although only half as good as in India, but best in Singapore). Start with Pani Puri. You will love Samosa Chat. Get Apple mint juice. The best on the menu is Chhole Bhature... Different varieties of it... All are good. Tastes great with chilly and onion. After this you can try Sev Puri, Dahi Bhalla and Bhel Puri in that order. Lassi isNot bad too.Sweets / Desserts are not so great. They are not bad, but you can find better other places in SingaporeDon't miss the (free) mukhvaas/ mouth freshener upon exit."

We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab! Crabs are about SG$3.50 per 100g at this place. There are about 50 stalls open at that time making it very hard to choose which stall you want your food from. The service was excellent from Pirate Seafood Stall! The guy Jason served us..he was excellent! I also tried the sambal pari/stingray.. it was nice! At 12am midnight, the place is still rocking..lots of crowds..awesome night out!"

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The standard,positive,50,7-May-17,"Despite many high end Japanese restaurants in Singapore, and the many hype and stars associated with them, I felt that Shinji is the one that still sets the standard of Edomae sushi. It is a pure culinary experience.My wife and I visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration and we chose the counter seats for better interaction with the chef and energy of the surrounding.We left our evening with the chef to take us through the wonderful Omakese journey he had prepared for us. It's difficult to explain in full the amazing favor of each ingredients and how they intertwined with each other. It's the skills and arts combined at work, and the respect that the chef had on the ingredients. This reminded us of the beautiful sushi experience in Tokyo and Otaru.We also ordered a bottle of chilled sake as recommended, it went very nicely with the dishes; we decided to order another serving and shared with the chef and staff as an appreciation.The ambiance was zen and minimalistic, soothing to the eye and body. At the counter in our evening we had mainly Japanese diners, giving the experience an authentic feel.It's a memorable evening and one that will remain in our mind for a long time."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unethical.,negative,10,15-Jun-14,"One word summary: Unethical.Visited the suntec outlet on Father's day hoping to have a nice time with my wife and my parents. Food was ok, service was bad and I think what you guys are doing with the still water is plain unethical. $18++ for water that I didn't want is ridiculous. When I asked the cashier why I was being charged $18 for water, she said that's the price of their product. Yeah sure, I wasn't given a choice for any other option. I was asked ""sparking or still""? You even opened a 2nd bottle without asking. Cost wasn't made known either. It should be made known that there is also an option of ""ice water"". You may defend and say we didn't ask. Sure, you make my $18 now but no matter how good your food is, and it really isn't, I'm never going back again. Neither are my friends. Ask yourself if it's worth it, since you're pretty new to Suntec. No wonder you changed FB page when your previous FB page has so many 1 star reviews. You may say other restaurants do this too, unfortunately you don't command the status, neither is your steak Wolfgang Puck quality, your price isn't $650, so don't try charging lay people who just wanna have a $20+ father's day dinner $18 for water. Feel free to explain your style of management and bad service.PS. Your ""still"" water contains high amounts of sulphate and doesn't even taste that great."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet lunch at shin minori,positive,50,8-May-17,Decide to have sashimi few days before the actual day. Used the Chope app and easily booked a reservation using the app. We were served promptly at the restaurant. Wait time for food was decent despite the restaurant was packed. The only problem we faced was the tablet that was used to order food keep hanging. Have to restart the app many times. The food list we ordered went missing a few time and we have to choose again. Hope they can solve the app issues. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Horrible experience,negative,10,03/28/18,"Just finished dinner at Long Beach Dempsey with my brother and his family who are visiting from out of town — and I will never go back there again! Although I made a reservation for 730pm, we had to wait for a table and we weren’t seated until almost 8pm. The food was mediocre at best. The razor clams were overcooked (and overpriced) with more minced garlic than clams. The house specially prawns were disappointing as were the house specialty tofu. However the worst part of the experience was that our Chili crab (the main reason we were there in the first place) never showed up! We had finished all the other dishes and waited over 30min. We reminded a wait staff, then after a while reminded another. We were then told the kitchen dropped one of the crab claws and had to prepare a new dish! Whilst the wait staff tried their best, they were clearly overworked, understaffed and not trained for any ‘service recovery.’ I will not be going back there again! "
French,L_Angelus,20th birthday,negative,20,27-Nov-16,"We went to l’Angelus to celebrate our son’s 20th birthday.I mentioned to a colleague of mine that we would be going there on November 26. He told me that he had been disappointed the last time he went there for dinner and he would be interested in getting my feedback.The starters were ok, 2 x escargots, 1 salad and 1 duck foie gras. Mind you, it is not very complicated. A good oven for the escargots and a good knife for the salad and for the foie gras.As a main course we ordered Chateaubriand, Bar and a Wagyu steak. The meat of the Chateaubriand was ok. We had to wait a few minutes for the gratin dauphinois. Needless to say that the meat was getting cold while waiting. When the gratin arrived, it came as a rectangular kind of a brick, coming straight from the deep freezer. Unfortunately, it did not stay long enough in the micro wave as the middle of it was still very cold.My daughter went for the beef. Again, a disappointment, the meat was chewy but the French fries were good. At least they were not cold and were served together with the meat.My wife took the bar. It could have been any fish as the taste was covered by the sauce. Not impressive at all.We did not take any dessert.One thing that was very disappointing was the service. No smiling faces. The service need to improve a lot, not friendly and not efficient. There were only 4 tables with customers.We had been there many times but last night was our last one."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great experience,positive,40,02/26/12,"We had been told to have Chilli Crab when in Singapore. Long Beach @ Dempsy was quite close to our hotel and reception recommended it as being good sea food. We were not disappointed. It is a very busy atmospheric restaurant and we thankfully booked before we went. They did say they only had garden tables left but when we arrived we were offered a table indoors which we decided to take. The service was excellent and the waitress very kindly helped us with the menu, which we found rather confusing. She gave suggestions and made sure that we didn't over order, which is so easy when you are not sure of portion sizes. All the sea food is completely fresh coming out of tanks. We had the house speciality prawns, suger pea shoots in garlic followed by the Chilli Crab and fried buns, a kind of sweet bread. We drank bear because the wine was too expensive."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore Experience,negative,30,18-Jan-13,"Going to a hawker centre like this can be a daunting exprience, knowing you will be attacked by people trying to get you to sit and order food with them, but a trip to Singapore should include a visit to this for the experience. The food also is usually excellent - and unless one orders something very special, one can have a delicious meal and be very surprised at how little they paid at the end of the meal. "
French,Paul,Doesn't make the grade..,negative,30,17-Apr-17,"Paul at Takashiyama, SingaporeHad lunch here. Paul in Singapore, pretends to be a restaurant in its decor and furnishing but the bites served here are the French version of ""le pret-e-manger"" or fast-food +. The crepe Suzette my wife ordered was below average. . Overall I wouldn't rate it more than average. The service was not what one would expect in a restaurant charging the prices it does."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A Local Legacy - Good Food - Simple Dining,negative,30,9/12/2013,I have mixed feelings about Yum Cha. I ate there two years ago with friends from the US who were working in Singapore. They raved about the best Dim Sum at Yum Cha so we mad our way to Chinatown upstairs to Yum Cha and had a delightful meal.I returned there a month ago and then took my family last week when we visited Chinatown. Its evident that this is a local establishment that continues to serve very good quality dim sum. I would have given Yum Cha a higher rating if their staff had been a little more gracious rather then just efficient and if the atmosphere was a bit warmer however this is my personal opinion based on my past two visits which were quite different than my first time dining there.If you are in Chinatown its worth checking out although a bit challenging to find the entrance in the shopping arcade.

French,Angelina_MBS,Lunch! Nice service! ,positive,50,13-Mar-18,Nice food with tea. This place is less populated so it was a good choice. Delicious and easy on the stomach. Not oily. But I wish they’d serve more salad.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good quality chinese food,positive,40,06/17/12,During lunch they serve good quality dim sum. The standard is guaranteed at Crystal Jade. Service is also generally good. Would recommend their Korean Ginseng Chicken branches for a taste of Korean food
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Street food,positive,50,25-Dec-17,"If you want real food, authenticity and local produce without the frills then this is the place. We loved it, went everyday once we discovered it. Please note, it’s cheap and is not at all flash so if you like silver service, this is NOT for you. The food however is fresh and delicious. $10 will get you just about anything and a large beer will set you back $5. Refreshingly affordable and authentic."

French,L_Angelus,Real French Brasserie,positive,40,12-Nov-15,"From trying many french restaurants throughout Singapore, there are many places that try to give a french flavor to their atmosphere and menu, but L'Angelus is truly the best for a real brasserie experience -- great foie gras (in several styles), an excellent selection of both entrees and mains, plus a variety of the traditional desserts (with nice new touches). All in all a good experience for a traditional french meal at a high quality but not fine-dining level."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over priced and too harassing, better hawker centres nearly everywhere else",negative,20,21-Apr-13,"We were warned about the inflated prices, but were still happy to try the experience . Very disappointing, the food was average and not as good or at least no better than food we had eaten at other hawker centres, including those within shopping malls. The harassment from vendors was relentless and made it hard to browse the food stalls. The prices were much too high for the size & quality of the food we had, definitely would not go back or recommend"

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A terrible Experience,negative,10,31-Dec-13,"Was part of a group planning to enjoy a delightful Christmas Eve dinner at this posh eatery. Our group arrived promptly at the reception just before 7' 0 clock which was our reservation time and waited expectantly to be seated. It was here where things went terribly wrong. Suddenly upon seeing our group, the lady receiving us ducked to the back quickly and called the manager out. The manager , smiling cheerfully, told us that our reservation had been cancelled by herself because a confirmation was not obtained even though the booking was made less than four days earlier. Our host who dines at the restaurant regularly had called the restaurant and was assured of a booking. After looking through her records, the Manager again, cheerfully, told us that the number they had taken down was indeed a wrong number as they mis-wrote one digit in the phone number. What a wonderful mistake as apparently phones nowadays don't have caller ID. They then somehow pulled out an unknown email address and were sending emails to some unknown party to confirm the reservation which was made four days earlier. So our group was left there without a reservation and refused entry by the smiling manager who couldn't be bothered by us by then as the restaurant was full. She basically summarized it as the restaurant had tried its best but mistakes do happen and cheerfully walked away and shut the door leaving our party stranded on Christmas Eve without even hearing our host's full explanation. 'Surprisingly', we did hear stories of regulars securing last minute spaces at the restaurant even though it was full. Apparently the manager will always see what she 'can' do. I would like to say thank you to that particular Manager for providing such exceptional service to our group on Christmas Eve and salute her for providing an experience we will never forget.This experience was thoroughly harrowing and we didn't expect this from an establishment supposedly dubbed the 'best Japanese Restaurant in Singapore' located in the famed Raffles Hotel. For those who are thinking of trying this place, consider Ki-Sho along Scots Road, they will most certainly honour your booking and ensure your party an enjoyable meal with exceptional food which will not be at the expense of others."

Value-wise it's about what you would expect from a quality steak place on Club Street.The atmosphere is always lively too and the decor is pretty cool with old school posters covering the walls. It's a busy place and would recommend reserving a table.Highly recommended."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli crabs indulge in nice setting!,positive,50,04/25/16,"Been to this branch of the franchise several times and always find it a hit due to the Dempsey Road 'upscale' dining location. Nice place to bring family and overseas friends to have seafood, get your hands dirty over chilli crabs and other yummy seafood.

Of course, the price also a bit steep.My hubby and I feel that it was not bad so we decided to try the newly opened outlet in Singapore. We were there at 2.30 pm and we got our seat without waiting.We ordered Coco tea and their signature Mont Blanc Tea suggested by the staff. Besides, we ordered Angelina Omelette, macaron and lemon tart. However, the lemon tart did not served, probably they forgot about it. I love their tea, it has the coco smell and nice. The macaron isnt the best which i had before but the atmosphere was really great and relaxing. Great place for chatting while having high-tea."
French,Saveur,"Helpful staff, affordable menu, good food",positive,40,9-Aug-17,"We were attracted by the affordable rates of the set menu and were forewarned by online reviews of the tiny portions only to be pleasantly surprised. The starters like the onion soup was a hearty portion, and the duck confit was substantial and tasty. It is already known as casual french cuisine so we weren't expecting to be wowed by the food and were satisfied with what we got. We met with a terrible mishap when one amongst us got her clothes stained by red wine and the staff at the restaurant had promptly come to our rescue and even offered us a glass of white wine (and further advice) to help with the removal of the stain. We are still so grateful for the assistance. Thank you!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always worth a visit,positive,50,5-May-14,"I recently returned from a three week stay in Singapore and ate at Newton Food Centre four times. On two occasions I ate at Ms Tan' (Stall 70) - I had some fabulous huge butter prawns on one occasion and the fabulous black pepper crab on another. Together with some greens and some rice it came to around 40 SGD each time. If you want cheaper then there are many stalls doing Char Kwai Teow etc for 7 or so SDG. I also had a couple of beers from a stall nearby which must be one of the cheapest on the island at 7.5 SGD for a bigger 660ml bottle of tiger. On the other two occasions I ate at the Indian (around stall 40 I think) and had a fabulous keema each time. Again washed down with a big bottle of Tiger. Yes, there are people trying to tempt you as you walk in the entrance but this is Singapore so it is hardly in your face! If you are a new comer I suggest walking around grabbing a table (under cover if rain is in the offing) then ordering a beer. Each of your party can then choose where they would like to eat."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Best in class,positive,50,11/21/15,"Peach Blossem has been my favourite Chinese restaurant for a number of years. The ambience is uniquely oriental and the tables are quite spaciously arranged.The chef table in the private room is most distinct and almost without fail every such dinning experience receive top marks from my business associates.When come to service, the team always attain a level of excellence. In particular Bowie gives good recommendation for food variety. She is always attentive and responsive. Mun Fung can remember my favourite tea for every of my visit.Overall the restaurant gives me a warm and homely feel. "
French,Paul,"Yummy Bread, but service a bit slow",positive,40,29-May-14,"I have been to Paul (Takashimaya Shopping Centre)twice in the last 3 months, and I have not been dissappointed by the food, nor the yummy bread which I always love. It is a little expensive but worth getting away from the norm in Singapore. Try the Mango salad, before you finish the free side serving of bread. Avoid peak hour like over lunch time unless you want to stand in a line. A little ahead of lunch time say 1145 is better. only negative is the service which can be a little slow, like we had to ask for water, the bill, food took awhile to be served but the wait is worth it. oh and yes take some bread home from the baker!"
French,Saveur,Ok.,negative,30,9-Jan-16,"Had high expectation for the duck confit but when I tried it, it didn't really ""wow"" me. Slightly understaffed but can be corrected easily."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,dim sum at is best,positive,50,1/8/2012,"This is a dim sum heaven in the heart of Chinatown, during weekdays you have to order from the menu but during weekend waiters pass by from table to table with trolleys packed with bamboo buckets full of dim sum delicacies. A must try in Singapore and don't forget to eat your dim sum drinking only water and chinese tea for a very far east experience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dim sum in Chinatown - just get there early,positive,40,11/25/12,Despite the reviews about grumpy staff we were pleasantly surprised and had an enjoyable lunch. Good selection of average quality dim sum in a great location if you're in China town. Staff were helpful and responsive. Get there early to avoid the long queues.
French,Saveur,French made accessible,positive,40,4-Jun-16,Party of 7 for Mothers' Day Lunch. They have a discount for the 2 mothers in the dining party which was a more meaningful gesture than the typical overpriced special occasion menus. Saveur stuck to their tried & true set lunch menu. The dried baby shrimp & noodle appetizer is noteworthy as is their entrée duck confit. All the other options were no less delicious. They're affordable and unpretentious. On the repeat list. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration ,positive,50,4/9/2017,"Mum’s birthday dinner recently at Peach Blossom, Marina Mandarin was very pleasant one. The food was delicious and staff was very warm and friendly.They helped with the Peking duck so presentable with the side sauce. The rest of the duck meat cooked with dried chilies and cashew nuts – bot crispy and tasty! Other dishes includes vegetables with scallops and tang hoon was refreshing with a unique clean clear taste. The ostrich meat was tender and nice, and the Fried Rice recommended by our waiter was a “WOW” – DELICIOUS!We had dessert – glutinous rice with ice cream and avocado with ice cream served o dry ice flowing. So impressive! Both refreshing and delicious. Then come the longevity buns… it came with a big plate of beautiful wordings and read out cheerfully by their staff Christine. What a sweet gesture! The buns were so delicious that we ordered another 10 to take away!We enjoyed so much that we forgot to take photos of the food. We learnt that the figurines made from flour by one of your staff Terry after his working hours! So creative and Impressive! He said it takes about 7 days to solidify – a charming souvenir indeed!We would like to thank Terry, Jeff, Alden and Christine for making our mother’s birthday dinner so unexpectedly memorable. This place has simple hidden charm.. and we would love to come back may times again!"

He is a regular and made straight for Alliance Seafood number 27 and Alvin. They are in the Michelin Guide. We shared a variety of platters and I liked them all, but especially the calamari. This is alfresco eating and the centre is full of locals. So it should have been good and certainly was."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not even close to the L'Entrecote standard,negative,20,19-Oct-14,"Unfortunately, my visit was kind of a disappointment. I have always enjoyed their sister restaurants in London, NY and Geneva but the standard at the Singapore restaurant isn't even close to it. First of all is the air conditioning not working properly so the temperature is uncomfortable. Tables are to narrow to each other and waitress acts like first day at work. The meat, fries and famous sauce is not even close to the standard. Avoid"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Chilli Crab!!!!!,positive,40,10/29/14,The chilli crab here is to die for.....just super along with the fried bread rolls. Their fried rice is a must have and the chef's special prawns too. This is the BEST place for chilli crab so don't try any other place.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch ,negative,30,1/2/2017,Used to visit this restaurant quite often but today is a let down cos both lift and escalator were out of order and my father in law had to struggle to reach the place in second floor . Food still ok but the place is jammed pack . Food served at quick pace though crowded

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Top choice for Indian veg foods,positive,50,13-Jun-15,"On my 4th visit I finally decide to write this review. I'm a non veg eater but this venue really impresses me and also my friends. Food: Every option is perfectly made. Such large variety to choose from. I've never eaten anything I didn't enjoy so I know the other 80% of menu will be tasty. Service: This has been acceptable. They try to come across and upmarket service but it gets so busy and staff just do a simple job. They have these iPad minis to take our orders down. So the owner is moving forward. There was even this nice aunty clearing tables often. Nice. Atmosphere: it's not fine dining. Not definitely not casual. It's perfectly in between. Nice chairs and tables. Clever paper place mats. Deseert sweets on display as you enter. Pleasant water features. Round tables. Can cater for large groups. Next door us events room. Huge kids party was taking place. Mostly busy so makes one feel the place is well liked and not just a tourist spot like some racecourse road venues. Cleanliness: the restuarant was clean. But bathroom area next door needed more attention. As said. Just busy place. Still easy to wash hands before and after dinner. I recommend to enjoy the food with your clean hands. Overall: I will always come here for my veg foods knowing it's reliable. My vegetarian guests were impressed with the food, venue and pricing was reasonable. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Rushed Service,negative,30,10-Apr-16,"Food was good; sashimi fresh and generous. Grilled items done well and crispy. However the handrolls were not well done. Seaweed was soggy. However do note that the buffet has 2 sessions. 1130-1pm and 1-230pm. They should make this known earlier. Also, the UOB 1 for 1 promo is only for 1 pax per table. This should also be made known earlier."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average place,negative,30,18-Jun-16,It is a decent chat corner but nothing great to rave about. The prices are on the higher side. The service was pretty laid back and had to wait for dishes once the order was placed. The servers do not wear gloves and Hygiene factor could be improved
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Some good things to try (other than the seafood),positive,40,5-May-16,"Long before Newton Hawker Center came to be associated with expensive grilled seafood for tourists, locals used to come here for :1. Tanglin Hokkien noodles and oyster omelette 2. Bee Heng popiah and satay3. Heng fied carrot cake (this is actually mashed turnip/radish fried with egg, garlic and spring onions and, as an option - a sweet black sauce).We visited this evening for takeout of the Hokkein noodles, chicken satay and popiah. The Hokkein noodles fried fresh prawns and squid and a tasty prawn stock and, served with delicious sambal chilli and freshly squeezed lime juice was as good as it ever was (in high priced Singapore portions have shrunk though).The satay (boneless chicken skewered on wooden sticks and grilled) was fragrant and tender as was the roasted peanut gravy it was served with.The popiah didn't live up to expectations though - this is similar in concept to the Vietnamese rice paper rolls. The SE Asian version has stewed turnip, crunchy peanuts, chopped boiled egg and lettuce wrapped in thin popiah skin made from rice flour. The popiah skin does not have the translucent sticky texture of the Vietnamese version - it has a drier more grainy texture. What we got at Newton though was a little too dried out and the stewed turnip didn't have the depth of flavour we remembered. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,negative,20,1-Jan-17,"Restaurant was packed and I understand that the staff were busy, but that does not mean that they had to be rude. Lots of food order from the buffet menu wasnt served, asked to refill water but was ignored, even the lady manager was rude from the way she spoke. China staff even had to mumble to show that she was displeased when we requested to change seats before being seated. Horrible experience. Sushi and sashimi was okay but cooked food took up to an hour to be served yet served cold. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food,positive,40,17-Nov-17,"We ordered aloo parantha which is served with daal, vege, curd etc and was very yummy. We noticed that they provide more quantity of daal, vege, curd in takeaway order than dine in."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting but overall not as inspiring as I would have imagined,negative,30,23-Aug-15,This was a good meal don't get me wrong. I liked the way you were seated in a group setting (I was on my own) and got you seat at the cooking table. The presentation of the fish was excellent and some of the courses were truly great. But some were really very average. The wine choices were relatively expensive - even by this type of restaurant standards. My bill for one person came to 630 Singapore dollars. That makes this one of the most expensive meals I have had in the last two years. This didn't make the top 5 meals and might not make the top 10 if I go back and look at it. So that's why it gets an average.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Pricey good food,negative,30,25-Dec-14,The food at Muthus curry is quite tasty.

French,Paul,Misrepresentation of menu,negative,10,16-Oct-17,"I went there for breakfast with my wife and was appalled and thoroughly disappointed with the cafe.I ordered Macha green tea frappe and expected something to resemble green tea but what I got was white without any hint of tea. Too much milk.I ordered what was the equivalent of their big breakfast judging from the photos in the menu but the sausages used were entirely different. It looked like the cheap frankurters you get in the supermarket.When I asked the staff why the marked difference in presentation, they replied that I should not depend on photos when ordering food. Sad. They didn't even clean my salad properly."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant ar UE,negative,10,3-Jul-17,"I patronised this restaurant on 28th May Sunday together with four of my friends for lunch buffet. It was our 1st visit, the experience is bad. Waiter & waitress include cashier ' atttiude is terrible. No customer's sense. It is not that they are shortage of staff, they simply has no initiative, no customer's focus.We have to request several times to refill our cups. We have to walk to counter to pay the bill & queue while the waiter & cashier continue with their chit chatting. After payment, no acknowledgement no thank you. Never expect such lousy service & attitude in this Japanese restaurant, no matter how goood the food is, poor service will put customer off. The past rating of excellence is in the past. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food Quality,positive,40,7-Jun-16,I have been to Shinminori quite a number of times. I find that the potato I ordered yesterday didn't taste as good as before. But the other food were all decent and nice.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",To die for...,positive,50,12-Apr-11,"I was lucky enough to dine at Shinji by Kanesaka last night and it was incredible. If you're in any doubt as to whether to go there, just do it. It's not cheap but hey, this is Singapore. The food was stunning - I just wish I could dine here every night. I lived in Japan for 5 years and this was on a par with the best sushi that Japan has to offer. The chef was just gorgeous and so accommodating. The only downside (and a very minor one at that) was that not all of the wait staff were Japanese. But I am really splitting hairs to find something to complain about. One of the best meals I have ever eaten..."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic and tasty,positive,50,10-Feb-17,"Little place in the midst of other restaurant.

French,Paul,Check your salad for big bugs!,negative,10,28-Mar-16,"Last Sunday my wife and I had lunch at Paul in Ngee Ann City. We have eaten there maybe 15-20 times in the past already, and although the experience has been mixed, we keep coming back because of the European-styled menu and foods. However, this time was really different. To make a long story short, there was a gigantic insect in the salad my wife had ordered. She had already started the salad and only noticed the big bug when she was about to eat it... needless to say she didn't want any other salad. The staff apologized and said that they buy their salad from an external party and that the Paul staff should have washed it more thoroughly. Anyway, we were both disgusted and after having another dish and a small dessert, we left and will never eat a salad there again. I mean, they prepare this nice salad with vinaigrette and all, really nicely presented on your plate, and they didn't notice the big bug??? So the lowest possible score for this visit. So sad for their reputation, but this has to be the worst thing that can happen in a restaurant."
French,Paul,It's a shame ,negative,10,15-Mar-16,I tried this outlet many times. The quality of food is really bad. Either the food is cold or the waffles hard and the coffee is a nightmare.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newly Refurbished Seafood Hawker Centre,negative,30,19-May-16,"A good hawker centre for seafood. We went on Mother's day so it was very very busy, our last visit was 15 years ago and sadly IMHO it had changed for the worse. I now much prefer Maxwell, Chinatown or even some of the enclosed food centres. It was busy mostly with locals so they can't all be wrong. Because it specialises in seafood the meals are generally more expensive than other centres. But not really expensive compared to restaurants. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dimsum,positive,40,03/17/16,The Dimsum was really good and the price is affordable. The steam fish maw in shrimp paste is good. The restaurant area was quite big.
French,Poulet,Quite nice overall,negative,30,14-Mar-14,"Heard of the rather new Poulet opening in Singapore, and heard mixed reviews, so Edison*, Katherine and I decided to scout it out for our dining pleasure over lunch one day.They have many outlets, we chose the one that was closer to our workplaces in general - 133 New Bridge Road, Level 2, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413. The number is 6538 3595. There was no queue, so we snagged a comfortable booth seat.The interior of Poulet is relaxing, done in light hues and cushy seats, setting the perfect ambience for casual comfort dining of classic French cooking techniques. The contemporary concept of wooden tables and modern classic chairs made the place ideal for friends, family, colleagues and dating couples alike.After some escargots and soups, we had the Poulet Roti - their signature roasted chicken in homemade Chardonnay Mushroom sauce. The golden brown skin was crispy, and the inside was tender and tasty. Infused with the very delicious gravy, we all understood why this dish tasted divine enough to be the restaurant's signature dish.Served alongside the Poulet Roti was the Pressure-cooked Oxtail in Red Wine Sauce with Carrot and Onion. The oxtail was very buttery tender it floated into the mouth and just disintegrated smoothly, we were surprised. The taste was heightened by the impossibly delicious red-wine based gravy.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-poulet-restaurant.html"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mediocre food,negative,30,24-May-15,"I had lunch here with a bunch of people. I found the food mediocre. Had the salmon steak dish. I found the salmon a little tasteless and the sauce lacking. Ambience was okay (went to the Suntec branch) and service was relatively alright. Underwhelming experience, wouldn't return."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lovely Restaurant and doesnt allow you to miss India,positive,40,25-Feb-13,"We had our 6 out of 9 meals at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road, Singapore. Beautiful restaurant in terms of food and menu. Menu is the same as in India and the food served is equally well made and tasty.Portions are good enough to serve 2 people and given the Singapore trend, it does the fit the average bill.Must visit hotel for all Jain & Vegetarian food lovers. Should mention about the staff at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road location - very nice and helpful staff. Ever ready to help, suggest and give their best.Keep up the good work and all the best KP !!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Missing Food Order,negative,20,19-Dec-16,Some of the food we ordered were not served despite the fact we asked the staff to help us check and confirm that we have indeed placed the order.We have been here several times and we have experienced similar missing orders. But this time is the worst!I think it is time to look for a new place.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Horrible atmosphere,negative,10,28-Aug-14,"Came back to Singapore after 20 years when I used to live across the street from Newton Circus. They have seriously destroyed everything that this hawker centre was. Not only is it unrecognizable, but the vendors are pushy. The atmosphere is stressful and uninviting. Go to Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown for a real hawker experience. Don't get trapped in to Newton Circus. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great variety and worth the money,positive,40,24-Jun-17,"Came for the a la carte buffet. Lots of items on the menu to choose from, although unlikely to sample them all. Casual and comfortable atmosphere too.I liked the quail egg alot and their chicken was done well. The sashimi was a bit of a let down as the swordfish was slightly hard, not very sure why. If I had more lunch time I would definitely want to try other portions of the menu."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Restaurant with good variety,positive,40,17-Sep-14,"Went there with my friend and ordered a chat combo kind if thing, with pani puri and lassi.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great ambience, food & service @ Peach Blossoms",positive,50,11/21/15,"I dine here frequently with my family & friends, @ Peach Blossom. The staff & service here's very good, and we always look for the assistant manager, Terry and the service staff Mun Fung. Terry is a very friendly and approachable person, and never fails to attend to us. Mun Fung is a very friendly lady too. I am also very impressed with the flour figurine that Terry makes. I am never once disappointed by the service here. & the food here is up to standard."
French,Saveur,Mediocre food which matches the price of better French restaurants,negative,30,29-Oct-17,"I was quite disappointed with the food this time round. Each of the courses were mediocre. We ordered the Foie Gras for appetiser - that was probably the only item done well. The mains of Duck Confit (disappointing - skin wasn't crispy, insides were a little dry), and Slow Cooked Roast Pork Belly (awful soggy skin, bland gooey lentils) failed to impress. The bill came up to $55 for two, and that's for 1 starter, 2 mains. Frankly, if I had added starter, mains and dessert - the cost would have been at least $35, and that is the cost of a fabulous set lunch at some fancier French restaurants in town. I certainly would balk at paying this sort of price for Saveur, a no frills casual diner. "
French,Saveur,Food was better than the Far East and Purvis outlet,positive,50,4-Dec-17,"They took some time to find my reservation from Chope, but it was understandable as we were still very early for dinner. The staff took our orders promptly and served us drinks (though payable) which were always refilled even when half-full. Food came all at once, which was abit uncomfortable - we had to eat the duck confit first otherwise it turned cold and leave the salads aside first. However, the chilli crab pasta and duck confit was really really good. It was our first time to the Cathay outlet, and I feel it fares the best out of the other 2 places we went (Far East and Purvis). The other downside was that the staff were crowding next to our table most of the time (while they wait for new customers etc), which is why ambience only 3 out of 5. Would still love to come back again, just in a different seat!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so buffet,negative,30,23-Aug-17,General impression was not bad. Do not order the kimichi dishes as it tasted weird. Drinks are charged separately.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch,positive,50,03/18/17,Having lunch and settled for set lunch B at $62 per person with a minimum of 2 persons. Nice food and thanks Bowie and Alicia for serving us 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,positive,40,12-Sep-16,"A place which you can try most of the local food in one place.We usually visit this place once a month. And the usual stalls that we will visit is 'Hai Yan Seafood' and the fried oyster egg stall which the auntie has a bit of attitude problem. :p But the fried oyster egg is really yummy.The staff at 'Hai Yan' is super friendly. The stall is facing the main car park of Newton Circus. The service is good, price is reasonable and the food is yummy. We always order the sambai stingray and clams. "
French,Saveur,"Acceptable quality of food, generous portions, but service need to be enhanced",negative,30,8-Nov-16,"Food is good, not fancy sort but tasty. Portions were ample. Great value of lunch set.
Service really need to be improved. Staff are not very attentive, and lack of service knowledge. No major complain but was just observing."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but should have been much better,negative,30,10-Jun-12,"We had dinner at Waku Ghin in June 2012. We had the standard 10-course meal together with champagne throughout the meal.The meal started well with an orange-infused tataki of katsuo and the signature appetizer with uni, raw botan ebi and oscietra caviar. Both of these dishes were very good and similar in style and taste to what you would expect at a Nobu restaurant. You cannot get food that is much better than this anywhere in the world so we were in foodie paradise at this stage and expected this to be one of the best meals of our life.Unfortunately, the meal went downhill from this excellent start. We got a very bland and forgettable pan-fried fillet of Ayu followed by an overly rubbery teppan fried abalone served with what tasted like a standard tomato and basil pasta sauce. We suspect that the abalone would have scored higher points with the tyre making division at Michelin than with the firm’s famous restaurant critics. These two dishes were not to our liking and we braced ourselves for what was to follow. Luckily the dinner took a turn for the better with teppan fried lobster and two different beef dishes. These three dishes were all good, and based on premium ingredients, but the dishes were not memorable in any way (luckily we got a copy of the menu together with the bill – otherwise we would have struggled to remember the dishes). At this point, our meal at Waku Ghin felt too much like an ordinary teppanyaki experience. The savoury part of the meal was finished off with a somewhat boring consommé of rice and snapper followed by exclusive gyokuro first-flush tea.After this we transferred from the teppan counter to the dining hall overlooking Marina Bay. We finished off the meal with two forgettable French-style inspired desserts followed by mignardises.In conclusion, this was a good meal and the Osaka-born chef was excellent. However, at this price level we expect a more consistent experience and above all we think that a majority of dishes should be memorable. Sadly this was not the case and I do not think we will return."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Good quality buffet,positive,40,8-Apr-13,"Very few Indian restaurents in Singapore offer buffet service, so I was shocked to see the place.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big portions,positive,50,10/27/16,"We had a good talk with the manager on the choice of the menu and she recommended us the set dinner and was happy to accept alterations to it, extremely service oriented.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great night out with the family,positive,40,22-Dec-17,"Took the family (some hadn't been here before) for dinner with a difference. The food was as good as it has been in the past, fast service, great selection at very reasonable prices.Not quite as charming as it was years ago but all very neat, tidy and clean.The grand-children enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food. I enjoyed the food and the cold beers!As in the past this will always be a place I visit when in Singapore!"
French,Paul,Worst meal I have had in Singapore,negative,10,15-Mar-13,"Our experience was so poor, I am not sure where to start. Surly, disorganized staff - dirty cutlery - ridiculous wait for a server to bring menus and to place an order. As if that was not bad enough, the overflowing garbage can was too much until one of the staff sorting clean cutlery stopped what he was doing and proceeded to pick up garbage from the overflowing can and push it down before returning to sort more 'clean' cutlery. Needless to say, we had seen enough, got our check and left....never to return. The positive thing about Paul I can think of is its location on Orchard Road."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",No. 70 Mrs Tan lives up to great expectation,positive,40,13-Jun-15,"Having read reviews of the food here, we went along and wasn't disappointed to share an evening with Mrs Tan's attentiveness serving up wonderful food.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The people who work there did not seem to like their work.,negative,20,2-Oct-18,"I have been to Shin Minori since 2015. Usually for my birthdays. Or my Father's birthday. The service that was given today (Our dinner timing was 29 September at 7.30pm) compared to the first time we went, it really declined. I also saw that the table beside me on the corner, were complaining that they never got their food. That day there were 6 of us in a group. Our food was also quite slow but it was just how the people served it or approached us, it was cold and just seems like they do not like working there. Sashimi was not as fresh as the last few times I was there. Friends who were there for the first time did compliment that the BBQ / Grilled food were good. I am happy though that the menu still had Sword Fish because that is the only reason that I chose Shin Minori over other sushi place everytime. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Good set dinner,positive,40,8-Nov-16,Enjoyed the food and the company. Set dinner was very value for money. Portions might be small for big eaters but tastewise was good overall.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, great atmosphere",positive,50,07/19/15,"The Dempsey area is a bar and restaurant complex that contains many options. Long Beach is a definite highlight. Although it is hot they offer al fresco dining on the veranda, an inside area and private rooms. How much you like your chilli may determine whether you choose to sit outside.The menu is long and varied. You come here for the crabs of course but our starters of crispy mini-squid, razor clams and sesame prawns were fantastic.We had two crab dishes - in chilli sauce and pepper. You get plastic gloves and a bib to eat this course and you have to dive in with your fingers. The crab claws are as big as your thumb and index finger, meaty and delicious. Both dishes were amazing but for me the pepper crab just edged it - all washed down with ice cold Tiger beer. A great sign that so many Singaporeans eat here, although service may be a bit rough and ready for some! I loved it"
French,Paul,Best raspberry tarts in my life,positive,40,3-Oct-13,"Coffee, tea, hot chocolate so so. Really love their raspberry tarts, sweet and a bit sour fruit, big raspberry too. Think tiong bahru bakery has something similar but raspberry smaller andmore expensive. Paul is a nice place to go for afternoon teas. I think the croissant ($1.80 exclude gst and taxes) is nice when they heat up for dine in. It's certainly worth when they served you cheese butter and yummy jams with the croissant. But the better one ($2.50) is at the bakery shop right inside taka basement besides cold storage. The one just at the entrance of basement is $1.30 when you heat it up just like any nice croissant. Paul's sesame bread they gave free for group dine in is only $2.50. Where to get such superb quality at this price at bread talk. Paul only accept walk in. Happy queueing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Food/Hawker stalls...,positive,40,14-Dec-12,"This place has turned into a place for tourists. It used to be one of the premier places to go for hawker stall experiences but now, the costs are up there and it seems to be all tourists. Which is ok. But I live here and there are just too many places that are similar that don't cost anywhere near the same. (Chinatown for one). The food is good and you get decent service but.. well, there are other places to go. If you do want to go and see it.. go in the afternoon or very early evening to miss the crowds. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, great service",positive,50,31-Mar-17,The atmosphere at Shin Minori is cosy and comfortable.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not as good as I thought it would be...,negative,20,18-Jun-12,"My husband and I were i Singapore for a night before heading to our final destination Australia. My father in law made a reservation for this restaurant for me and my hubby and paid upfront for the menu as a gift for us. The menu was supposed to be tasting menu accompanied with wine for each course. After reading all the great reviews about Tetsuya and how great his restaurants were and after seeing the price of 1000 $ for a 10 course menu I really was expecting something extraordinary before coming to this restaurant. I was so disappointed. We sat down and got offered a glass of water and got served our first appetizer. I immediately thought - were is the wine which was supposed to go with our menu? Their English (believe it or not) was not that good (or did they pretend not to understand?) and it took them a while to see what we asked for. They said they had to check with their colleagues whether or not the wine was ordered!!! So we ended up waiting for them for the whole 15 min with the appetizer in front of us (we didn't know whether we should start eating it or wait for the wine) so that they could check whether or not we had wine ordered. For this much money I would expect the staff to be more professional in their handling of clients. They came back after a while with yet another colleague who, again (did pretend?), did not understand what we asked them about. In the end, after the whole 20 min of back and forth they finally agreed - yes, the wine was offered with your meal when you had purchased it...Wow - no sorry, nothing! So the dinner really started off bad, we had to argue to get what we had ordered, what un unpleasant start to what was supposed to be a high quality dining!In the end, the food was ok but definitely not extraordinary for what you would expect after paying so much money. The only original dish I liked was sea urchin - their signature dish I believe. Also, the waiters were not attentive and you had to wait for them to take plates once you finish a course."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was real good but don't expect service,positive,40,4-Jul-13,"This is probably one of the bestJapanese a la carte buffet that I ever dine in Singapore. Order as much as you like. Excluding drinks and alcoholic beverages. Approx $40 inclusive taxes per person.Must try items - sashimi menu, prawn tempura and curry udon.I would rate this restaurant very good experience.The Service wasn't attentive and waitress always forgotten what order. Not paying attention to table. Fail to top up green tea. This probably because we have more than 20 persons. Service and attention to details must be consistent."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must do in Singapore,positive,40,15-Oct-18,Always on my list to visit when in Singapore the chilli crab is amazing. Walk around and check all the stores and compare prices and service.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Visiting Tets in Sing,positive,50,28-Jul-15,"Been loving Tets food in Sydney for over 20 years so when we were in Sing, couldn't resist when the opportunity to dine at Tet's venture in Sing. It's only seats 20+ people at a time, most dishes were cooked in front of diners. Some of the produces were flown in from Tasmania, Japan etc… Waku Ghin serves Japanese dishes, unlike Tetsuya's in Sydney (Japanese with a touch of French). Excellent meal… Excellent selection of wine and sake too…Highly recommend"

Despite making eye contact with 2 staffs, we have been ignore totally. If staffs were busy, they could have given us hand signal and not ignoring customers standing at the door. As I have waited too long, in the end I had to approach one of the staff to tell her that I have made reservation and then taken to my seat. "

The sauce was more mustardy than the last memory there which didn't taste as nice. But the worst thing was that the steak was overcooked. Very light pink and no blood at all for a medium rare steak. And not to mention the really cramped seating :( This will be my last time visiting this place... "
French,Paul,Average!,negative,30,14-Mar-16,"Have tried Paul in London/Bangkok, hence will not skip a try in Paul Singapore Ngee Ann City just for a cuppa. But, a little disappointed, staff not so attentive. Order hot mocha, not at a great temperature, too hot. Macaroons were good."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food and Service,positive,50,5-Jul-17,"Visited the restaurant with the birthday month voucher. Food is ordered through the computer system. They are served fast and hot. As it was a weekday, it was less crowded than expected. Good quality food and is value for money as we (two of us) only paid for one diner."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Superb Japanese in Singapore,positive,50,18-May-18,"On a recent visit through Singapore and a birthday treat for a local, I and a friend dined at Shinji by Kanesaka at the Carlton Hotel.The atmosphere was lively yet relaxing.The restaurant had separate rooms for group.We shared a section with 4 other couples.We chose the mixed sashimi and sushi menu, fixed price around $300 per head plus a small Sake recommended by the host.The food was sublime.It was prepared for us by the master's chef in front of us.Every dish was an explosion of flavour, singing of the sea.The sea urchin roe was unctuous and luscious, washed down with the light and fragrant Sake.A superb night and fit for a special occasion."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great India Food,positive,50,24-Mar-13,"Little India is one of my most favourite places in Singapore. I love the energy, the smells and the food.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Japanese but can be $$$$$,positive,50,1-Oct-16,"Went for dinner with a group of 5 at the Shinji, Raffles hotel. We took the smaller rooms which can occupy up to 8 pax. Ideal for group and also cosy. Food was great and fresh sashimi. We took omekashi set dinner and cost a lot with 2 bottles of sake. It was recently crowned with 1 star Michelin and expect the food and service at the TOP notch. Expensive but worth a try ."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sensational Singaporean Seafood,positive,50,07/16/16,"ScrubySnacks loves seafood and Long Beach did not disappoint at all. Every single thing we ordered was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. As per usual, we over ordered but spent many hours simply grazing and enjoying the wonderful vibrant atmosphere of the restaurant and fantastic service from their chirpy and entertaining staff. Highlights were definitely the steamed crab and pepper crab. The very enthusiastic waitress even helped to crack the claws open for us which made it even more enjoyable. The crispy mini octopus was also deliciously sweet and moorish. If you are in Singapore and looking for the very best seafood, ScrubySnacks would highly recommend a visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey. Cannot wait to return, next time with elasticated pants. And don't forget to wear the bibs as things can get a little messy, but don't worry, it's all part of the fun and experience. "
French,Paul,Not Impressive,negative,20,20-May-13,"Price paid not worth for the service & food rendered. Servers not attentive, food took way too long to arrive even when the restaurant is not packed. $8 for a small cup of orange juice?

Chinese,Crystal Jade,Terrible Service and extra charges,negative,20,3/1/2017,"Crystal Jade has had a reputation for good dim sum dishes.The food is still quite good though below the standards it used to set.The BBQ pork roll and SiewMai we had were both quite tasteless,for instance.The service is terrible-the waitresses ignored us for as long as possible then were unhelpful when we made some simple questions about the dishes.The table was dirty and still not properly cleaned after they came to clean it.Annoying in particular were the extra charges.For instance we asked for two glasses of iced water (hardly San Pellegrino!) and we were charged for them.The rather tired pickles already on the table when we sat down were charged for,as were the paper towels."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Fantastic,positive,50,29-May-12,Brought a visitor here for dinner. It was wonderful. Food and service. We also managed to have a bottle of wine which was kept chilled for us and poured for us regularly. The staff was wonderful.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",best restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,15-Apr-14,Awesome food and excellent service. Each course was amazing and spectacular. Much better than Tetsuya at Sydney. The chef himself was very friendly and it was a truly wonderful meal.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","So fresh, a real delight.",positive,50,22-Mar-14,"On a recent trip to Singapore, I booked for lunch to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday, as he loves Japanese. I was hoping that the restaurant would live up to the hype that I had read on this and other websites. I had emailed for the booking about 2 weeks out and had to confirm the morning of our booking, otherwise I would have forfeited my spot. The restaurant is set up in separate rooms with a chef central and table/bar set up around him so everyone gets an unimpeded view of the chef preparing the many dishes. our room had seating for 8 guests, but not sure if they are all the same.The food was magnificent and was very pleased to say the restaurant lived up to the hype. Attention to detail was extreme but graceful. It was like watching a performance, the prep, the reverence with the food, the effortless cleaning, the concentration on presentation, and the graciousness when being served. We had Keiichi san as our chef and he explained about the wasabi and how they grind it down using a shark skin mat, that is alarmingly sharp. Because we were a little later (our booking was for 2pm) we were the last in our room and had lots of opportunity to ask about the dishes, feel the balance of the knife and talk to the chef about his training and where he worked previously. I felt that our chef was very interested in explaining the dishes and general conversation, I didn't feel that we were putting him out or anything. The waitress was attentive but not annoying. She appeared at regular intervals when required, and otherwise gave us space. I really enjoyed this experience for the ambiance of the restaurant and the delightful food. If we make it back to Singapore would visit again."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not impressed,negative,10,09/27/15,"If I am not mistaken, this restaurant is inspired by the four seasons and gold mine in bayswater, London. We had the roast duck, char siew, egg tart, duck snow bun and weren't impressed with either of the items. The duck fat wasn't rendered at all - the roast roast duck had thick slab of fat between the skin and meat. I didn't know they meant the name London fat duck that literally. In my opinion, the ideal roast duck should have succulent meat texture but with minimal visual fat between the skin and meat. The meat was kind of dry in this case. Char siew was okay, loads of honey. Egg tart had more flour taste than egg. The duck snow bun needs improvement because the snow bun is sweet with the powdered sugar on top, the duck sauce was even sweeter. Just a quarter of this snow bun sends you in line for diabetes. I guess we just expected so much more because we liked the four season's version of roast duck and when we visited the restaurant, we had the impression that it would be similar."
French,Paul,It was okay,negative,30,3-Jan-17,"Got a coffee and some dessert, it was pretty average and very pricey for what it was. Coffee was mediocre and cakes were nothing fantastic. Good ambiance and service but food served was just boring."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best restaurants in Singapore,positive,50,15-Nov-14,"I was here for a birthday treat given by my husband. A few dishes stood out in particular. 1. Fresh oyster given an Asian dressing (Alas, I have forgotten the names of the dishes) I would have never thought to pair oyster with vinegar. That was brilliant.2. Smoked eggplant. I would never have thought eggplant could taste like this. The smokiness that came along with the eggplant was sublime.3. Omi beef. Need I say more?4. Scampi. It was juicy, fleshy, tasty... I don't know if I could use any more adjectives for this.The gyokuro served at the end of the meal was a lovely touch.The only dish that we were a little disappointed with was the uni with caviar. Perhaps, the earlier dishes have built the expectations too high for this signature dish. Or perhaps, we were too used to the uni served at the sushi-yas. It did not suit my palate.Otherwise, it was a fantastic meal with impeccable service at Waku Ghin. This restaurant is easily one of the best in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friday night,positive,40,29-Oct-17,"Food came pretty fast but somehow because it was a Friday night, a lot of our orders came in repeat ! Maybe can opt going on mon-thurs when there's less people to avoid such. Food was okay not bad for a Japanese buffet."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but expensive for what it is,negative,30,8-Jan-17,This was my 2nd visit. 1st time was 2013. Whilst I enjoyed the meal I felt it wasn't the same as the first time.... perhaps different chefs.? The service was a bit cold and I didn't find the chef engaging. Food was good but not as good compared to the likes of hashida or shoukouwa. Pricey for what it is I think.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great food, and impeccable service",positive,50,10/31/16,"Had a casual dinner with family. Great food (very fresh crab) and atmosphere.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Felt ripped off,negative,20,31-Oct-12,"Expensive ingredients cooked up quickly. The chef was concentrating solely on cooking coming across as robotic. During the wagyu course, another chef came in to help but ended up chatting with the chef. It is a collection of elite ingredients such as abalone and lobster prepared simply and displayed pretentiously. The room seats a group of people at the teppan counter and it was simply awkward during the many waiting minutes with no music. Disappointed that water is $20 per person and a sip during dessert left a bitter after taste. It appears that rich businessmen with money to flaunt are the clientele rather than food lovers. Nothing stood out except the price."

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",very poor service and not worth the money,negative,20,13-May-18,"The service is very poor. As there many vegetarian restraunts in syed alwi strongly an unfit place to have food. cleanliness is very poor.
They charged an extra item in our bill and dint even apologise to us for making a wrong bill. will never...More"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",excellent japanese experience,positive,50,15-Mar-16,we enjoyed our Counter with only four People in the room. the Food is excellent. the ingredients are of the highest Quality. worth the high Price you have to pay.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Delicious steaks,positive,50,3-Dec-15,We had a lovely meal with friends & family the steaks were full of flavour & cooked to perfection! A great atmosphere with a great view & efficient staff.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Veggie lover's Paradise!!,positive,40,26-Jan-14,"Situated in little india, this 'vegeterian' resturant is an ultimate place to satisfy your taste buds!With a very vast menu and varity of cusines, the starters will make your tongue drooling. Specially the chaats are amazing.The main course might dissappoint you a little as compared to startes, but is again not at all a bad option to try.On weekends, there is a long queue so please book table in advance else be ready to wait. Service is slow given high rush of footfall, but they will keep your cool with their warm behaviour.Average meal for a couple costs SGD 30-40.In all, a must try for all vegetarians."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great tasting food, but service very questionable!",positive,40,11/12/2011,The Crab here is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted on the IslandAmbience is ok - view of Holland road in the backgroundYou have to be careful as they try and sell you too big a portion of crab.. and it is fairly pricey.. but it tastes so good...Service from the waitresses is bizarre - they just dont seem to care too much and couldnt care less that your there really - quite snotty and we dont really care attitude.. but that was my and my friends impressions but it didnt really spoil the food (reminded me of China town in Sydney!)Tables/quality is very average - just a notch up from Hawkerish.. not classyBut despite all this the food was great and that is what we went for.. so I'm giving this place 4/5 and it would get 10/10 on Food!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible service,negative,20,03/14/15,"The staff who served us were unequivocally non-chalent about taking orders. They were only interested in quickly unloading those already cooked and being put on trolleys. They were rude at best.Some of the dim sum was good, but some were tasteless. The fried dishes were cold. I rather spend less at restaurants like crystal jade/ding tai feng and get better food."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb,positive,50,1-Jul-14,"Words almost fail me in describing this meal. Our last meal at Waku Ghin was wonderful - hence our return visit - but in many ways this was even better. This isn't just about the fabulous food, its the whole experience; the theatre of the food being presented and cooked before your eyes, the beautiful presentation, the immaculate service and the venue. Yes it is expensive but we left feeling that it was money well spent. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice steak,positive,40,31-Oct-17,L'Entrecote The Steak & Fries Bistro service one of the best steak in town.the fries are one of the best i had.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food if you don't mind the unhappy lady taking your orders.,positive,40,02/19/16,Food is good though portions are extremely small. Especially of good value is their set dinner. The waitresses are extremely cheerful and friendly. Same could not be said about the lady are taking our orders. She are grumpy and unhappy and seems intent to let it be known to us.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh seafood with good recipe,positive,50,9/4/2017,"I probably went more to East Coast for seafood but never try it in Dempsey Hill before. The whole place is different from the city centre but full of reminiscences of the colonial times. The first dish of deep fried lobster is so fresh that surprised all of us. Unlike the traditional Cantonese way of preparing seafood, there is always a different spice of south east origin in every dish. Same goes to the pepper crab, fish and others. At the end, there is the noodle with blue swimmer crab. It is so delicious to end of the dinner."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",#27 Delicious chili crab!!!,positive,40,11-Sep-15,I like to introduce my one of favorite chili crab restaurant.I like the chili taste. And I love to eat crab.

French,Angelina_MBS,Amazing BRUNCH at Angelina Tearoom,positive,50,18-Aug-15,"I was so thrilled when I first got wind that THE Angelina Tearoom from Paris would be opening a new branch right here in Singapore! I’d been to the Angelina Tearoom in Rue de Rivoli in Paris (for the curious, it is located near to Westin Paris Vendome). The kewl Tearoom with beautifully decorated interiors once played host to Coco Chanel and Proust who were regulars at the Tearoom. I was curious to know if the Angelina outlet in Singapore could match up to its parent.I’ve read many online reviews criticizing the slow service. Well, just so you know - I NEVER visit a restaurant/cafe/tearoom - during the first 2 weeks of their official opening. You need to give the staff time to be trained and get up to speed! I went after the 3rd week of their opening - on a weekend - at 12 noon and I wasn’t disappointed.It was crowded but they managed to get me a table. The tables here - especially for 2 persons is small. But the cafe brought out additional small tables to ensure that our dining experience would be noting but fantastic. We were served by an amazing waitress named Pamela. After the meal, I was asked to fill in a Feedback form. Needless to say, I gave Pamela and the team full marks for service and everything else listed in the form.I had a wonderful Brunch experience. It really is very value-for-money to have Brunch here. The Angelina Brunch is priced at S$39.00++ per pax and is available until 2.30pm - daily."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",If you're tired of the regular restaurants...,positive,40,14-Jan-12,"... Newton Hawker Centre is the place to visit, to walk around, have a look, chose, sit down under the open sky without any aircon & enjoy simple but tasty food.The food was okay, not of the quality as JUMBO seafood east cost, but okay. & the atmosphere is unique, especially when all the year you've to eat in 5* hotels, posh restaurants.Another bonus: it's open very late.We loved it!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,positive,40,13-Nov-17,Buffet is pretty good. Ordering is done through a tablet. However a cup of ice water or green tea costs money!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese buffet around,positive,40,22-Apr-17,"We had gone for the lunch buffet. Reservations were a breeze with the Chope app. The place was easy to find and we were settled pretty quickly to our seats. Ordering was via a tablet. The quality of food was very good and fresh. However, one of our last orders never made it to our table but that was fine since we were too stuffed by then..."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great food, Wonderful Service",positive,50,9/1/2016,"Came here for a family dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the evening! Food was great; the wasabi prawns, the Ying yang hor fun, and the silver cod in Chinese wine were particularly good. Service was fantastic, particularly the attentiveness of our main service staff, Christine. We were also celebrating a birthday and were pleasantly surprised that the birthday cake was decked on a plate with a Chinese poem handwritten calligraphy style! There was even a cute little figurine made of sugar. Many thanks to Terry, Bowie and Nobel who were working hard behind the scenes to create the yummy dishes and the wonderful birthday surprise.Definitely coming back again. A very good dining experience, the food was very yummy, and the birthday boy was very happy - a thoroughly enjoyable evening made possible particularly because of the wonderful service of our service staff Christine! Highly recommended if you seek an enjoyable evening with good food and service that will not disappoint."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dinner,positive,50,01/16/16,Had dinner here with a friend. Very nice food and very good service. The staff are very friendly and product knowledge is excellent. Will definitely recommend friends and family to this place.
French,Paul,Place with a view,negative,30,30-Nov-14,"When you need a coffee break during your shopping at Takashimaya you will find the coffee and cakes cheap because you just spent so much at this paradise of luxury. It's actullat not and the quality is average but the location runs the show. sit next to a window and watch the world go by and dont be angry about the steep prices, you are in a choice location where the rent is probably as high as in NY or London. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Reliable Chinese restaurant,positive,40,03/25/15,"Although this is a famous chain restaurant, the quality of foods is very reliable. Various dim-sum items and good environment inside the restaurant. Especially the duck foods are tasty and recommended."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic South indian flavour,positive,50,8-Jan-16,"Wow 4 yummy chutneys served on green banana leaf with mouth melting idli .Crisp dosa ......
Sambar was just to what one would rate as authentic with exact consistency
Right opposite Mustafa being centrally located
Its true value for money."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It is All About the Delicious Crabs!,positive,50,07/19/15,"Pepper, White, etc. The outdoor and porch dining is also a plus! The stinky pudding is another thing. A MUST GO destination in Singapore."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent service with housepour wines by the bottle,positive,50,30-Mar-16,It is definitely worth trying here if you're a fan of French wines. Tried their specialty steak with free-flow fries and it was amazing. Only issue is they don't accept reservations which is a bummer for organized people. Would definitely come back again.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Liked the taste and service,positive,40,23-Jan-14,"The restaurant situated in a nice and crowded location. Just outside the Mustafa Centre. Serves very tasty Indian food. Pricing of food is also reasonable for the quality of the food and service.
The staff are very busy and still serve the food always smiling....More"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Cashier’s service / image was a flop,negative,30,10/15/17,"Cashier for that day was unfriendly.We arrived with no staff at the entrance and I went to the counter to ask for a table and she totally ignored me! And when we’re paying the bill,she was totally arrogant!Blessings were the serving staff were great!!!"
French,Saveur,Affordable French Restaurant,positive,40,18-Oct-16,"French food not necessary to cost a bomb, Saveur is a good place to enjoy decent french food at affordable prices. However, I find their set menu are very inflexible, everything cannot change! from food to drinks to whichever. What if some don't take certain kind of food and drinks?"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service needs improvement,positive,40,3-Jul-16,"Food was served very slow despite the place was not fully packed. My friends and I order grilled food and it took close to an 1 hour for the food to reach us. Some orders was not served as well, yet the server there told us it was already served. Need more improvement on customer service."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Yummy char siew noodles,positive,40,7/11/2015,"I was glad that I asked for take out with such a long wait going for those looking to eat at the restaurant. It was a small area and hence the long queue. I ordered the char siew noodles and duck noodles. Both are dry version . The take away was a genius, the sauces and chili were all provided in separate containers. by the time I got home, the noodles were still springy ,not soggy."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Some of the best Idlis I've ever had,positive,40,9-May-16,"Have been wanting to visit Murugan's for a long,long time. Haven't been to the one in Chennai also. So when a friend suggested this in Singapore a few weeks ago, I jumped at the idea. The Idlis were outstanding!"
French,Saveur,Chope voucher is for a la cart food only,negative,30,1-Oct-16,I have bought chope vouchers for set meals and I have used chope vouchers for set meals at many other restaurants. However only Saveur made their own rules that it can be used for a la cart food only. Disappointed because this terms and conditions were not told or written.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Food is good but service is pathetic,negative,20,21-Mar-17,"I love the food there. But service is as bad as it could get. Hygine is another issue.
Especially if u are served by the ladies. Gents are still better off.
Its still one of my fav place but I have decided to shy from...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best indian vegeterian food in singapore,positive,50,15-Oct-16,"Almost all menu items are good to try. Price is on higher side but worth it. Service is great. I have been visting for 2 years, was never disappointed. Must visit if you are indian vegeterian."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is delicious but the price is a little bit expensive,positive,40,06/28/15,"One of the most delicious dim sun restaurant in Singapore. But you must be careful about the price which does not include 10% service charge, 7% government tax, towel and peanuts on the table."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Will return,positive,50,17-Jun-14,Had the hana 9 piece lunch set for $75. Every single sushi was an artwork and so skillfully prepared. It was a joy to watch the chef prepare it infront of you. Every piece was a delight. expect a lovely surprise if you go on your birthday!
French,Saveur,Updating my previous review,positive,40,7-Apr-14,In my last review I mentioned that the service I received at Concetto in the early days of their opening was not very attentive. I still think that the food is fabulous and have yet to leave room for the great looking Tiramisu. However since I wrote my review I have learned that the owners intentionally hire front of the house staff who are new to the hospitality industry and provide them on the job training/experience. I think this is such a worthwhile effort that I wanted people to know and so I wrote this update.
French,Saveur,Downhill,negative,20,15-Oct-17,"My 3rd visit since 3 years back, but that was in their Far East branch. Was a bit hard to get service, they weren't too attentive. Fair enough to say that it was Friday night and it was almost full house. 2 of our mains came much later than our friends. When it arrived the duck confit I had was not warm enough. My mash and mushroom were cold.. duck was not crispy. Sad. They were better in the beginning. Not coming back."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, reasonable prices, wide variety :-)",positive,50,16-Apr-12,"If you like to try lots of dishes and south east asian cuisines, then Newton is the place to go. It's very clean with really tasty food but it's not air-conditioned. If you want authenticity at a really reasonably price, then Newton will tick all the boxes. Just bring a big appetite :-)"
French,Saveur,Good food but pricey,positive,40,15-Jan-18,"Food is good. However, the pricr is considered high for the portion received. Place is comfortable for gathering and chit chat."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",love the food though service is kinda slow for one part,positive,50,18-May-17,"Please have more discounts so I can bring more people! :D thanks for your hard work though, there were a few people so you had to make sure you were fast"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Once again a very good lunch...,positive,50,24-May-17,Have been here for business lunches on many occassions - the service is always very good and the food - although simple - is always great!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Service and Food,positive,40,11/14/16,"Selected this Restruant to celebrate a special occasion and was not disappointed. We had one of the many selected menus and there was plenty of food and all enjoyable. Wine is expensive but again this is a high end venue. Location was extremely good and offered a variety of seating, big or small groups."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,positive,50,2-Feb-17,"most value for money japanese buffet I had in the longest time, sashimi was thick and fresh with no fishy taste and the dishes were served hot. However, would like to feedback that clearing service could have been done faster due to space constraint of the tables. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Can't even surpass duck rice Ina hawker centre,negative,10,3/12/2016,"We ordered duck with rice, crackling pork with rice, each dish $7.80. It came with one half stalk of xiaobaicai, and just a splash of sauce. The duck was powdery to taste. It was quite honestly a big disappointment and there are many hawker centres which would easily surpass this restaurant in standard. A dish of oyster veg also cost $$7.80, consisting of eight half stalks of xiaobaicai boiled and splashed with oyster sauce. There was no queue. We told the wait staff that the food was not acceptable. She thought we were talking about the rice itself, and could not believe that we were talking about the duck. Never again "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious!!!,positive,50,20-Jun-18,The service is very good. Staff is very co-operative. The food is awesome. You would love to eat chats.
French,Saveur,Great overall!,positive,50,21-Oct-17,"Good food, great value lunch set! Nice restaurant setting, clean & bright. Staff are polite & friendly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at a historic location with great service.,positive,50,08/29/15,"Great food at a great location with great service, and with a little bit of history. There is a lot on the menu to choose from, and it's hard to go wrong. This is a place you want to put on your ""must do"" list for Singapore, not just for good food, but for the atmosphere. Outstanding seafood. The pepper crab, the shrimp and the sweet/sour fish were excellent. Sitting outside on the veranda in the evening, with the overhead fans going, and a slight cool evening breeze made this seem like a throwback to the old colonial days. (Probably a lot better food today than then, however.) The (relative) cool of the evening made veranda dining a pleasure. And they serve ice cold beer well: in refrigerated mugs. There's nothing like having an ice cold beer on the veranda on a warm evening, while waiting for an outstanding meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Convenient location, good food",positive,40,15-Jul-13,"Even if people complain that the the newton hawker center is overpriced, touristy, etc, etc... One can't deny that it is convenient to get to and is quite near orchard road. It is still reasonable but like any other similar eating places around the world, you should watch your bill and what you are paying for.Just went during the day with a lot of stalls closed. To get the full experience, it is recommended to go in the evening 7pm onwards. Ended up eating and getting my favorite stingray and sambal kangkong in stall 53. It was very good, decently priced, and surprisingly - the owners were very nice and friendly! Also left my bag in front of their stall and the female owner was nice enough to see it and hold it for me.No matter what people say, the convenience of newton circle for me is the main draw."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Restaurant Review,positive,50,22-Jul-16,"Amazing restaurant. The food is very delicious. At the end, they give you a paper where it shows everything that we have ate. The service is very nice and friendly."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday ,positive,40,10/19/17,"Terry and all the staff was very friendly and helpful.
The Food was very good and nice cozy environment. Will be back again soon keep it up"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome as ever,positive,50,29-Apr-11,"This is the first time I have returned to Newton since it's renovation a few years back. I have to say I like it still. The food choices are great and I really enjoyed the cha kue teow, bbq chicken wings, oyster omelet, po piah, kang kong belachan and roast duck...and tiger prawns grilled with garlic.The only thing I didn't really care for is that the vendors kept chasing me as I look like an angmoh (even though i grew up in KL and Sing) and am Eurasian. They left my relatives alone as they looked more local I suppose. No big deal though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Cannot be better,positive,50,7-Apr-13,"Hard to understand the some mixed assessments of this extraordinary place. WakuGhin really deserves to be among the highest evaluted gastronomique places in the world. Five minutes in walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands, take the way thru the gallery of the casino (impressive), you enter a world which first reminds you on a simple teppanyaki grill. To a certain extent it has similarities, but what and how the food is prepared and presented is a class on its own. You must choose the menu, which is worth every cent, starting with unforgettable Gillardeau oysters, a Sea urchin, which cannot be better in Sicily, a fillet of Tasmanian Grass-Feed Beef, which for us won against the Wagyu and, and ..... Just order and let surprise yourselves, you won't forget the evening. And talk to the sommelier or to the well experienced service staff. If you like Pinots ask for what is not on the wine list. We had the recommended Ontago Burn Cottage, a dream to this menu, so the second bottle was a must."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Birthday Dinner.,positive,40,5-Apr-17,Birthday dinner for a friend was great. The steak was superb. Love the steak. The service was good as well as the staffs was very patient and polite with us despite us having troubles in ordering our food as we not too sure what to order. They served us the birthday cake with the lights off as well. Thanks for snapping for us pictures as well. I'm a hotel concierge that is located nearby robertson quay and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my guest without a doubt. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,positive,40,23-Aug-18,"If you like sashimi, you will like the thick cuts of fresh fish here. Serving is a bit slow . Some of the dishes were too salty."
French,Saveur,Excellent Food,positive,50,3-Dec-17,Yet another unknown number of time I’m here with my wife. Great food. Value for money. What else can I say.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Disappointing,negative,20,12/6/2016,"This is a restaurant I really look forward to going to, however this time it was very disappointing. They charged for the nuts on the table and even for the hand towels. The service was so slow that I had to get up several times and make the waiters come over to our table. The person behind the bill counter was so slow it made me think that she was putting on an act. Food was average and a bit expensive. I ordered a fried rice five times and it took twenty minutes by which time my three year old was hysterical, I ended up having to take it with me. Last time I was here I would have rated it a four at least."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Uneven night for service and food,negative,30,06/30/16,"We dined on a Tuesday night but it felt like a weekend since all the tables were full and the place was very busy. We had some issues at the start with a server who didn`t understand English was was quite surprising since the place is so busy with ex-pats and foreign visitors. We tried many dishes and some were great - the Scottsh razor clams, Black Pepper and Chilli crab for example. Others like the steamed fish and prawns were fairly average. The steamed fish had been cut up away from the table and seemed to have been a rushed job since it full of bones. Service was slow throughout the night which was a little understandable with it being so busy. Overall pleasant evening but nothing to get over excited about."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Second time here!,positive,40,18-Feb-17,"As the title suggests it was my second time at Shin Minori. It wasn't as crowded as the first time, but probably because it was a weekday lunch. Food was delivered promptly and I noticed the staff were friendlier this time round :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood!,positive,50,10/4/2016,Excellent chilli crab. Good value with excellent service. We opted for a set menu with a couple of extra dishes which was a good way to have a selection of what is on offer
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Possibly best North Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,positive,40,5-Nov-16,"Steadily growing in Singapore over the last 6 years, KP is possibly one of the best Indian restaurant. Cuisine=======Primarily north Indian Vegetarian, Mumbai chat and sandwiches, Indo Chinese, Sindhi dishes, sweets, Falooda etcIt covers quite a big range.My preference ===========Sev Puri ( Chat)Paneer Khurchan ( I'm sure the spelling is wrong)Hyderabadi Biriyani ( Subtle but amazingly flavoursome)Located diagonally opposite to Khansama (another famous restaurant), usually the place is crowded (especially on weekends).Ideal for a lunch with your family or even a party with friends, KP is indeed a must go restaurant if you are in SG."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Efficient,positive,40,4-Sep-17,"The service has improved over the past one year, more efficient and the food quality maintained, still as good"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food at this restaurant,positive,40,6-Dec-16,"Value for money. Service staff very polite. Manager waived payment for wrong order, no questions asked."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great North Indian food,positive,40,18-May-15,"I was impressed that they had a separate menu for Jain Food to suit my requirements. Very tasty North Indian food, and decent service, though occasionally lackadaisical. Yet, went there quite a few times during my 5 month stay and was not too disappointed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap food,positive,40,27-Jul-13,"We ate here twice, with our 3 children. Had amazing mee goreng and murtabak. So cheap, cost $20 to feed our whole family. You need to ignore the tauters, the stall owners are not supposed to approach you with menus but some do. We didn't find it too busy but we were there by 6.30pm, if you eat later it can get very busy. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome restaurant,positive,50,13-May-16,"Hey guys!If you are searching for a good North-Indian restaurant with the best chaats and Chole bhathures, this is the best place. I have been there multiple of times. The Pani puri there is heavenly. The restaurant has an amazing ambience and is clean. It is definitely expensive but the food is worth the money. I hope my review helps you guys!Bye! "
French,Paul,Bad and unfriendly service,negative,20,3-Sep-12,"My family and have been to Paul twice now, and twice it has been disappointing for exactly the same reason: Paul seems unable to make sure that everyone around the table gets their food at approximately the same time. The first time we had our three kids having to wait half an hour while my wife and I got our meals after maybe 10 minutes. And last time it was my wife who's breakfast hadnt even arrived when my kids and I were already long finished. Its not such a large restaurant, nor are the dishes very complicated, so it shouldnt be so difficult for Paul to serve everyone relatively quickly and at the same time.A friendly apology in such a case would go a long way, but the staff is very disinterested. They couldnt care less it seems. We had to cancel my wife's meal.It's a shame, if Paul could train their staff better, it would be a great (though still very pricy for such simple dishes) place for breakfast and lunch."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec - Food Good, Service A Disappointment",negative,20,14-Jul-15,"In spite of the negative comments on service we ate here as we wanted a ""beef fix"" and it was very convenient to our hotel. Steak was cooked perfectly, sauce excellent and the fries were well-prepared, almost perfectly salted. But the service? Our watiress didn't seem to know what service meant; when our daughter wanted a slight change to the pasta beneath her salmon she didn't know what to do and pushed-back to a a change at first, then commenting that it was odd (daughter wanted pasta tossed in garlic butter rather than a cream sauce). Never refilled empty water glasses, when plates were cleared I counted at least 22 times that she walked passed our table and never asked if we were interested in cofffee, dessert or the check. When I spoke with the hostess she tried to rectify by offereing free dessert (she comped corkage on our wine instead as we wanted to leave) but also seemed well-aware of the issue. The owners need ot address this. There are plantly of similar comnents, and the staff is impeding sales in a busy area where several hotels could feed service if the concierges were in a position to recomment the restaurant. I know I shared my experiece with the Conrad concierge."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but inconsistent!!!,negative,30,18-Oct-15,"We visit this place quite frequently as part of the Little India grocery trip. I find the food to be good -- my usuals are Chana Bhatore, Dahi Puri & Lassi. Generally good -- however, I find the food quality and taste to be highly inconsistent, especially Bhatore can be oily at times. The service too is nothing to call out.Its also a bit of a struggle to manage baby chairs."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Was this the best meal I have ever eaten?,positive,50,27-Nov-11,"If it wasn't it was certainly in the top 5. OK it was eye wateringly expensive for Singapore ($400 Sing for food alone) but the ingredients were the best quality in the world, they were beautifully cooked and presented and in a lovely intimate environment. Frankly I would rather have one fabulous meal like that than a dozen ho hum meals. Particular standouts were the signature dish of Sea Urchin with Oscietra caviar, the Alaskan King Crab cooked on the teppan on salt and the wagyu with fresh wasabi. We did have some excellent wine to accompany the food but it seemed almost redundant because of the subtle complexity of the flavours. In a word - superb!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very bad atmosphere,negative,30,11-Sep-17,"Very unlucky that the next table is a group of ladies who talk loudly.
It was really terrible and they really ruined the great atmosphere!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Huge delicious crabs. Consistently good restaurant ,positive,40,1/9/2016,A staple with my family. Black pepper and chilli crabs are really good. Probably only in Singapore. Fried baby squid and belacan clams also v delicious. I particularly enjoy the thick and fragrant sauces. We had three 2 kg crabs. Huge and meaty. S$78 per kg. Very enjoyable!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Rip off- watch the add ons!,",negative,20,8/3/2015,"Be careful when you dine here. What we thought was a small dish of complimentary peanuts,($2.00!!), and hand wipes, (60cents each),were added to our bill! And a teapot of tea was $3.60!!!Dishes were cheap $2.50-$4.80, but service was terrible. We were given a menu, pencil and ordering sheet to fill out. Food tasted stale. No sign of authentic dishes, eg chicken feet or beef tripe, or porridge, or veggies. Still looking for authentic yum Cha in Singapore."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved the seafood here!,positive,50,08/28/13,"OMG, the chili crab and pepper crab here were absolutely amazing. Fantastic. I could have eaten every meal at this restaurant. My h travels on business to Singapore - and his Chinese speaking work colleagues took us here for dinner. Dempsey is a great little area full of busy restaurants, fun to walk around. There was quite a line at the restaurant - luckily for us, the colleagues got there well ahead of us. And ordered. I don't know what they put in their chili crab but it was addictive. Totally addictive. I wish I could make that at home. Black pepper crab was also great. We had the spare ribs which were very flavorful and had a beautiful texture. One of our hosts ordered a whole coconut as a drink - which seemed unusual but was actually pretty tasty. Just be careful to get the right utensil to dig out the coconut - or you might end up wearing the coconut milk!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,seems a bit worn and pushy,negative,20,10/10/2011,We found the staff to be prompt but pushy. They tried to upsell us on every item. for what we got it was expensive.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Tasty South Indian Food,positive,40,4-May-17,The Murugan Idli Shop is a must visit restaurant in Little India. They serve amazing Idli's and Dosa's along with 4 type of chatni. This place is mostly crowded but the service is quick. One must definitely try their milk peda after having a meal.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Dining Experience,positive,50,9/6/2017,Visited the restaurant for lunch. Wasabi prawn is one of my favorite dish. I also enjoyed the dessert with dry ice effect. Their special dessert Almond cream Hands with Whole Coconut was fantastic. Service was never..never disappoint us. Keep it up.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Special Occasion,positive,40,30-Nov-14,"The entire experience is fantastic. The doors are opened as you walk in, the preparation of the first drink in proper Japanese perfection, the courteous nature of the staff, the chefs. And then the food - impeccable, sublime, heavenly. Expensive - but worth every cent for a special occasion."
French,Paul,Not up to the usual Paul standard,negative,20,12-Apr-17,"Took a coffee, sandwich and cake at this venue. The quality of sandwich and cakes was not up to the usual Paul high standards. Sandwich bread was hard and stale, cakes were dated and past their best by date. Disappointing visit. The staff were also unfriendly and not attentive. Needless to say that the prices are very, very expensive but hen again this is Singapore !"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth the money spent!,positive,50,19-Sep-16,"I must say, food standard has definitely gotten better especially with their sashimi! Food was on point in terms of taste & freshness. Food was served fast too. The customer service of their stuff was excellent and definitely commendable. Overall a very good dining experience at Shin Minori. Thank you guys!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reservation Received with Accuracy,positive,50,2-Apr-17,Reservation was confirmed with several automated calls. This should be complemented with email confirmation as the calls were sometimes made at times that I was unavailable
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An Amazing Dining Experience,positive,50,28-May-18,"We had our own private room with our own private chef, so this was a very special evening. The chef brought out a box full of assorted fish and shell fish, all still moving around - can't get fresher than that. I can't decide whether the uni, abalone or the wagyu was the best dish of the night - everything was amazingly delicious! We ended up with about 13 dishes with wine pairing. For your foodies, can't recommend this place enough, a must do in Singapore!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing,negative,20,01/19/14,"A very nice setting but sadly the food was bland and uninspiring. The peeking duck was delivered to the table in very small pancakes, we would have preferred to have done our own. The pancakes were tiny and very thin. The skin was not at all crispy. The soft shelled crab had a sad heavy coating and lacked flavour. The noodles with the remaining duck meat were very bland. The clay pot chicken was definitely the best part of the meal. We were encouraged to have rice dumplings for dessert, these were small chewing gum textured balls with dried longon, wolfberries and lotus bean paste in a warm sweet liquid. Sounded great but they were AWFUL! Cost approximately £90 and we came out hungry. Not to be recommended."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but bad ambience,positive,40,11-Sep-17,"Went recently, food was great. Ordered the standard sugar cane juice, sting ray, satay and rojak. All are a must try. Food are reasonably priced.Ambience however was not my favourite. Hot and stuffy, filled with smoke and grease. Some touting, but they leave you to be if you are not interested. Must go if you stay at Sheraton hotel as it is walking distance."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good (albeit oily) food, but not great value",positive,40,09/29/14,"The food is quite good - especially the chili crab and black pepper crab, but frankly the leading seafood houses (eg. Long Beach, Jumbo, No Signboard, etc) are exploiting their fame (busloads of tourists or vans full of visiting businessmen descend on them!) to charge very high prices. You can have as good seafood at much lower prices at more out-of-way eateries."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum,positive,40,06/20/15,"Recommended to me by a taxi driver. The restaurant can be difficult to find- the sign is a teapot and upstairs.
Only had the dim sum which was good and hot, service fairly average and prices OK"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Wonderful for special occasions,positive,50,26-Mar-17,"Very personal service. SGD450++ tasting menu is the best I've ever had & worth every dollar. Very beautiful presentation & extremely tasty dishes. Had wine and sake pairing at SGD250++ which covers 8 different types. Loved the sake, didn't fancy the whites so much and liked 1 of the 2 reds, but all personal preferences. Extremely good desserts as well! Deserves Michelin Star! "
French,Saveur,Average I would say,negative,30,16-Sep-17,The food potion is small and i feel food are over price but overall experience is average. Nothing bad though..
French,Paul,Bad service! Paul @Takashimaya,negative,10,5-Jun-14,"my friend and I went to this place mainly to find a place to feed our babies. One of the lady staff prepared a sitting place for us to include 2 prams which was much appreciated. But another guy staff asked me to ONLY take 1 pram and leave one outside.Obviously, we're not happy because our babies need to sleep inside the pram after feeding.my friend and I insisted that we really need the two prams to be in.Well, If it's too limited space to bring in the pram, he can actually ask us to wait for another sitting area instead of give that bad suggestions. *which I can see there's other tables already cleared.We almost want to leave but then we choose to stay because the lady helps me push the other pram in while my friend can start to feed her baby first. Good service from the lady staff.We ordered ice latte and the taste just average and the chocolate cake taste alright but not delicious. Given a choice, we wouldn't want to choose this restaurant anymore."
French,Paul,Piece de Boeuf - a masterpiece!,positive,40,14-Jul-15,"At first I was only interested to try their pastries. But then when I saw people sitting to have lunch, then I decided to try their meals.One of the most recommended menus was ""Piece De Boeuf"" - Beef sirloin served with salad and fried potatoes and shallots.The taste was superb! I never tried anything like it. The steak was very soft and felt like melted in my mouth. It's a must try ;-) The price was not cheap but it's totally worth it."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Japanese gastronomic high end,positive,50,3-Dec-15,"Usually i hate malls and restaurants inside, and when you arrive to your private room, you can only be feeling trapped. But the food journey, the dining experience, the variety of dishes, the products and cooking quality is so high.. When you are invited to join the common dessert room with (at last !) a view on the marina, you realize it s exceptionnal. On top of that desserts are excellent, not far from a french starred dessert chef.. Service a bit rigid and overwhelming but the cook was nice and discreet which made it globally very good anyway. It s super expensive, definitely not worth any diner, but it s poshy place, singapore, far above competition, fully booked all the time, so just bring your platinum visa and forget about it and enjoy if you can."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab and pepper crab - WOW ,positive,40,12/19/16,"I was there with some business colleagues to get some local seafood. The chili crab was great but for me the pepper crab was awesome. I was surprised by the intense pepper taste. So hot and remarkable! To ease the hot food try the coconut water. It became my favourite beverage at Singapore. The atmosphere was... Ehm... It was really crowdy and the plastic chairs don't feel comfortable. Anyway: if you love seafood, go there! "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Is it worth it?,negative,30,24-May-15,"Shinji is not a 2 Michellin star restaurant: its chef has been awarded 2 stars but not for this restaurant. Shinji serves the best sashimi I have ever tasted. Bar none. But in the end, it is raw seafood. Ain't no big deal. Its wine list is limited but its Saki menu is extensive. If you walk out of there for less than $900 Singapore dollars you have done well. If you book a table at the Sushi bar don't expect a private dining experience. I'm pleased we went there but pleased my partner paid. It is so over-rated that I would not go back. But, been there, done that. Tick."

Excellent food and excellent service "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious chilly crab!,positive,40,4-Jun-14,It was a little confusing at first where to eat but by walking around and seeing which places appeared to be busier than others we managed to find a seafood place.It was an experience to 'choose' our crab and then have it delivered to us! The chill crab was delicious; the soup was just right in consistency and chilliness and was complimented by some fried rice. We then had some traditional tea to end our lovely meal. We did find it value for money because we saw chilli crab advertised outside the centre and it was a lot more expensive than what we paid for.

We went for lunch buffet, with sashimi, yakitori, soup, side dishes, and rice noodles. Their portion is very very small, and a bit salty for yakitori. Expect for salmon sashimi, I don't think anything that I've ordered was nice. Ended up, my friend paid more than 40 for that meal, even they gave us a 10 dollar voucher, but I will never want to visit this restaurant again for below average food. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wedding Lunch at Peach Blossoms,positive,50,09/26/17,"We had our wedding solemnisation and lunch held at the Peach Blossoms Restaurant in July. We chose the venue due to the Delicious & unique food, great natural lighting and beautiful interiors which showed up well in our wedding pictures.Vivian was our wedding coordinator and has made the experience a smooth sailing and stress free process. She was very friendly and responsive throughout the wedding planning process and gave lots of helpful suggestions which we very much appreciate. We enjoyed the flexibility of not having to confirm finer details eg menu, guest list till closer to the date which made wedding planning a breeze. For couples who don't want a stressful wedding planning process vs the traditional wedding banquets, I will highly recommend this place. Guests had fantastic comments on the food, we were able to customise our own menu. Feedback on the food tasting was well taken into account on the actual day which we very much appreciated. My favourite dishes were Roast chicken with dried chilli and Steamed grouper with chinese ham. Very yummy and highly recommended! Vivian went out of her way to make sure the day ran smoothly by staying back after operating hours to conduct a wedding rehearsal for us which was her own suggestion. She was very patient throughout the process. Vivian also personally help cut and plate our wedding cake and her plating skills were impressive! We had such a memorable day and will highly recommend Peach Blossoms restaurant! Thanks to the staff of Peach Blossoms who went out the way to make our day so special! We could not have asked for a better experience and venue to hold our wedding."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,28-Jun-16,"If you want to have a great taste of north Indian or south or west Indian, this is the right place to goVisited numerous times, and like the food always.This is pure vegetarian restaurant, so a plus for us. It's a bit pricey though, the quality compensate the price.A must visit for Indian food lovers.They hVe one more branch just opposite to gate no 2 of Mustafa near Anand bhawan. That place is smaller compared to this one. Ambience is quite nice."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Waste of time and money,negative,20,5-Jun-13,Not worth it.....food is not that great....if you ask for alterations (like leass spices and all) they will never follow it!Home delivery time is 1.5 hrs and food never reaches before 2 hrs.Once i even received my entire order with out salt n that too after waiting for 2 hrs.Bikanerwala does much better job.Papri and rice flakes which they use in their chats are alwys soggy and not crispy.Boondi raita is a mix of very less curd and lots of red chilli.Masala lassi is again filled with red chilli only.Staff is most of the time too hay wired to be organised and attend to guests properly that can be beacuse vegetarian people dont have much options.Definitely not recommended if you have time and patience to wait and look around for another decent place.
French,Paul,Lacking,negative,10,7-Jun-15,"Came to the Taka outlet for a Sunday brunch, and as Sunday brunches go, one simply would like a perfect meal on a warm sunny day to prime up for the melancholy Monday soon to come. Sadly, Paul requires more work in this aspect and is nowhere remotely close in offering a palatable experience. My girlfriend and I had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated, which, I must add, is absolutely normal for a fully packed cafe. However it is slightly discerning, and a tad bit infuriating, when one waits for 10 mins when there are empty tables within, as with the case today. But that's not a big deal cause it could have been worse and far longer than 10mins. So we finally gets seated and I ordered a beef tartine to satisfy my morning cannivorous urges while my gf gets her daily dose of good ol anti-oxidants in the form of a crepe champignon. After a decent wait, the waitress came with the crepe and a salmon tartine. With no inkling how beef could have sounded like salmon, I immediately informed her that my order is wrong. Instead of an apology, I got a dirty death stare in return. But she went to change the order nonetheless. So I waited and waited, until my gf is almost done with her food and my beef tartine was still nowhere in sight. I have to qualify that I do see a couple of beef tartines heading out of the kitchen, but were served to other tables whose patrons came after me. Isn't it typical common sense to serve it to the disgruntled customer whom you've gotten his order wrong first? Subsequently, after this arduous 20min wait, I decided to ask the waiter to check on my food. Albeit unlikely, perhaps my English was not clear and he brought the bill instead. Nice. And when I clarifed, he skipped to the kitchen to check and disappeared with no response on the status of my order.To sum up, my food did come after this tormenting wait and to be honest, it wasn't great - definitely not worth the wait nor worth the trouble nor worth having the excitement of a Sunday brunch desecrated. For all the gourmet food that Singapore offers, for better or for worse, Paul simply does not cut it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good value for authentic Dim Sum,positive,40,9/5/2011,"We had lunch here on our second day in Singapore and it was a great experience - very authentic dishes for Dim Sum. The service is perhaps not as good as the food, but this tends to be the case in most Dim Sum restaurants.Best to arrive earlier on Sundays, to avoid the long wait at the entrance."

We had a room but it was poorly maintained and rather cramped.Cutlery was not thoroughly cleaned with stains on almost all the pieces we were given. Terrible ...We ordered a set which costs more than a $1K but the fish was undercooked and had to be returned for 'additional rework'.Other dishes were ok but certainly not fantastic for the price paid. The overall experience is mediocre in terms of service. Certainly not somewhere we will patronize again..

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper and Chilli Crab in Singapore,positive,50,12/26/16,We make it a point to go once on every trip to Singapore. We were 6 so we ordered both the Black Pepper and the Chilli Crabs. I loved the Chilli but my son and daughter in law loved the Black Pepper. Hint: Your waiter will remove the meat from the shell if asked. (highly recommended) We all agreed the Royal Razor Clams with Garlic were spectacular for a starter and of course we had Fried Buns (to lap up the chilli sauce) Fried Noodles were perfect and the Fried Kailan with Garlic added to the treat. Draft pitchers of Tiger Beer and coconut / mango jelly to finish the meal. Reservation is a must.
French,Paul,Awful service,negative,20,19-Dec-16,"We had lunch there, ordered a baguette and a burger. The baguette was old, I almost lost a tooth trying to eat that. The burger was good. They brought our beverages almost when we were finishing our food (after we complained twice). No apologies and no smiles. It took them another 15 minutes to bring me back the menu for some dessert.I wouldn't recommend it.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",how much salt can you get in a curry,negative,10,19-May-12,We heard great stuff about this icon of food. Our experience was sitting next to a toilet with terrible rubbery chicken and the content of a Russian Salt Mine in the food. NEVER NEVER NEVER again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE PLACE for pepper crab,positive,50,7/12/2017,Spendy - 258 SGD for a family of 4 - but a classic place for pepper crab and chili crab. A great atmosphere. You can sit inside or out. In a rustic setting. Highly recommended.
French,Paul,"Take away, don't waste money dining in",negative,30,20-Jul-13,"We have heard from friends and colleagues how great Paul is...the real french bakery in SIngapore, a must visit!First experience was with takeaway - perfect. Real good bread, amazing pastries, nothing to complain about, just great and we will be back again and again.Today we decided to go there for breakfast. Please, if you think about doing the same, don't bother. It really is not worth the trouble and the money you leave there.The line outside was not too bad, we only waited about 10 min. Service was fine, neither good, nor bad, quick and to the point.The worst thing is the actual food. Not what you expect from a French bakery with their prices. They make great breads and pastries, so I just cannot understand why they must serve such mediocre food. Croque monsieur for $17 with cheap turkey ham and tasteless cheese and few sad salad leaves? Salad was actually the best thing on the plate. A very big disappointment. Coffee was another disappointment. Honestly, you will have a much better breakfast at Toast Box with great coffee for a good price.We are sticking to takeaway at Paul, pastries are the best we have found in Singapore so far."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Poor service and serve half cooked food,negative,20,23-Oct-16,"I visited with my family to Kailash Parbat after reading reviews on trip advisor. But my experience was totally opposite We ordered Channa Bhatura. It came after 40 minutes. The chana was also hard and half cooked. The service is so slow that when we ordered extra bhatura, they took 20 minutes to deliver. Not happy at all with the service and also ambience. The ambience is also very dingi. "

Excellent cuts of fish that are perfectly seasoned, paired with warm, moist and vinegar flavoured rice! The tamago here is sweet, soft and outstanding too! Service is friendly with lots of attention to detail. Each visit is a trip to sushi heaven!"
French,Saveur,Experience at Concetto,positive,40,22-Jun-17,"Food was mediocre but portions were just nice. I felt that the caramel lava cake with vanilla iceream did not justify the $12 price tag, excluding gst and service charge. However, the starters and mains are good for better quality food with a lower price tag. I feel that the standards have dropped since the last time I went there."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good easy food,positive,40,4-May-12,Found a stall on the outside as inside it was too noisy. Got on well with the stall holder who returned the favour every time we visited. Food was good and relatively reasonably priced. Beer price was the same as it was 10 years ago.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent,positive,50,03/22/14,"Went there alone but the staff was very helpful in making the selection. They even adapted for my taste the Wagyu beef by replacing the longan with asparagus. The seafood rice was outstanding too. Yes, it is an expensive place but that is kind of expected."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi and sashimi,positive,50,4-May-14,"Having dined all ovber the world and having grown a passion for Japanese food, I was totally gob-smacked by the expereince at Shinji. I tased varieties of seafood that I have never seen before (e.g. fresh spider crab) of a quality and freshness that bowled me over (e.g. sea urchin and tuna straight off one of their 4 weekly airfreight shipments from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo). The preparation was faultless and the service was excellent. Expect very little change from $1000 for two people even if you choose moderatley priced beer and sake rather than premium vintage champagne (and a bit more if you choose the top omakase menu called ""Shin"")but those who quibble about the price simply don't get it - it costs money to employ sushi chefs who have over 15 years of experience and it costs money to air-freight the best seafood you can find from Tokyo. If you are into Japanese this is a must-do expereince in Singapore."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",really for locals,negative,30,2-Jul-14," Very different to 15 years ago when it was relaxed and cheap food. This time it felt hustled. Rushed to a table and seemingly forced to order in a rush. The food was very expensive and average quality. We got poor value because we looked like tourists, which is a bad thing here now."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top notch quality from the original creators of the black pepper crab,positive,50,08/23/16,"It's been a long time since I ate at Long Beach Seafood. It's been a household name for the longest time. I was not too optimistic when I entered the restaurant because the interior looked jaded. I was wondering if the food and staff will be jaded as well. After my friends decided on what to have for lunch, we placed our orders-A 3.5kg Blue Alaskan crab cooked both ways-Chilli and white pepper, Geoduck sashimi, Golden Line Lobster, Fish Maw soup and veggies.The manager told us that there were only two Blue Alaskan crab and we took on of it. When the crab arrived we asked if they could de-shell it for us. The staff was more then willing and we were happy to hear that. Not only did they de-shell it they also played it nicely and we were impressed. When we tasted it-it was OMG! One of the best chilli crab we ever had, the meat was sweet and tender to the bite and the sauce was top notch bursting with flavors or the spices and chilies. Next can the white pepper crab and man it took it to another level! The white pepper sauce had a Nic buttery taste to it as we dipped the crabmeat into it and into our mouths. My friend who always had a judgement for most foods was speechless! I enjoyed that moment. Next came the Geoduck it was sweet and crunchy as a sashimi. They also told us to dip the other part of the geoduck into the double boiled stock to remove the smell. And it tasted so good but way better then abalone. Mind blowing! The lobster was good too and fish maw soup was delicious. Overall we had an excellent lunch and the seafood was top notch in terms of flavors and freshness. A must visit if you ever come to Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good.,positive,40,11-Oct-16,Value for money using entertainer app. Staff were attentive but not flexible. Booking for restaurant was easy. Food is not too bad for buffet
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great choice of food,positive,40,19-Aug-18,Visited at about 8.00 on a Friday night and really struggled to get a table. You can obviously eat from any of the stalls but the tandoori on the outside was great for authentic Indian food.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money especially with time Chope voucher,positive,40,18-Sep-18,We got a good deal at 50% off with Chope vouchers . Steak was great and generous free flow fries even better. Only gripe about the place is tables were incredulously close ! I would don’t estimate at most 15cm apart thus no privacy for those looking for a nice quiet date
French,Angelina_MBS,Great atmosphere but strictly ok good..,negative,30,2-Jul-15,"Had a rare Monday afternoon off and thought of checking out the new Capitol Piazza when we came across Angelina. We ordered the onion soup, ham and cheese club sandwich and a cold cut/cheese appetizer. The servings were really generous I must say..the onion soup which my hubby had was really nice but the bread of the club sandwich seemed fried and it was quite cheesy too. We ended with a lemon tart which my hubby liked but sour desserts are not my cup of tea. Overall was a pleasant experience..service was very good and I will go back to try their chocolate desserts and maybe brunch menu! "
French,Paul,Convenient location,positive,40,10-Aug-16,"Paul at takashimaya orchard. Right in the center of shopping area overlooking orchard road. Standard french cafe with coffee, teas and cakes. As expected, price is on higher end."

The resturant interior is beautiful , calm with very efficient service. We opted for some safe Cantonese food with the stand out dishes being the Peking duck and Kurobuta pork which were divine. The bill was reasonable for the quality and presentation of dishes and my friends at work even sent me over a bottle of bubbly from the UK which the staff set up , a nice surprise and it made the day even more special . If you are around the Marina Bay Area well worth a visit ,The set meals also look interesting and varied."

French,Paul,Awful Service,negative,10,16-Sep-17,"Have visited this venue on several occasions however this time the service was shocking. We had to wait about 15 to place our order, we only ordered 2 cold drinks and 2 Tuna rolls. The drinks and 1 roll came I had to follow up 3 time and about 20 minutes later the 2nd tuna roll came. They clearly didn't the order right in the 1st place as the waitress appeared to not really concentrating on our table order.. The service was quite shocking, there appears to me no management direction of staff and all staff appear to be serving all the tables so they look like they are running around like headless chicken. And again while waiting for then bill we had to ask several times for this.. the staff appear to be wrapped up what ever task they are doing at that time and not taking into account customers around them.The tuna itself was fine however the salad had seen seen better days and was not fresh "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not worth it. Completely overrated and expensive,negative,20,31-Jan-15,"We arrived for dinner at this lovely restaurant. The lovely lady welcomed us warmly and with a smile which is rare in Singapore. The restaurant offers 3 package meals, the cheapest is the 15 sushi piece meal with soup and is $220 per pax.We ordered the sushi meal and immediately the lady's face changed and in front of us crossed eyes with the chef and rolled their eyes. The chef asked us if we were sure that we didn't want sashimi. We confirmed that we wanted only sushi and answered with a disproving tone as if he was too tired to make all that sushi or wasn't worth his while.The course menu was ok but nothing spectacular, the rice was hard and uncooked, the nigiri felt apart. This is not a bad restaurant but it's not worth what they charge and does not deserve the reputation.As a plus, the chef accepted several sake shots from another customer and by the end of our course he was happily drunk and very distracted. He also accepted tips very happily. Not something you would expect from a Japanese chef of this category."
French,Paul,First visit to this outlet,negative,20,13-May-17,"let down from its name sake. well known in the cafe industry with outlets across the island, this outlet was so poorly staffed and managed and the manager staff who finally showed us a table did not even smile once at all not to us alone but to all who were there.

I suggest this fact is displayed clearly OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT to avoid fooling would-be customers ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A tourist trap,negative,20,31-Oct-16,Disappointing experience. This hawker centre is not what it used to be. It now caters to tourists looking for sea food. Most stalls sell sea food...which also means there's a big competition amongst hawkers and you can feel quite intimidated by them trying to make a sale. There are much better places to eat in Singapore. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good Munchow soup,positive,50,2-May-15,"We were a group of 6 people visiting Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa center. This was my First visit to this outlet. I have visited the other one near to temple on many occasions. We tried mix of Indian & chinese dishes. The munchow soup was really very very tasty. It had the right mix of hot & sour taste. After long time i had such a good soup in Singapore. In the main course we ordered paneer gravy, hyderabadi biryani and mix of roti & naan. They were all cooked very nicely. He staff was very helpful. One of us even got their mobile phone charged while we were having the meal. Our requests for hot water, pickle etc were well looked after. I also found the staff interacting with some customers who seemed to be regular on the table next to us in a very friendly manner. All my visits to Kailash Parbat have been very satisfying. I am sure to visit this place again. The munchow soup is highly recommended. "

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Traditional Cantonese cuisine, and Creative Dim Sum with a modern twist.",positive,40,12/23/17,"Peach Blossoms Located at #05-00 6 Raffles Boulevard, Marina Mandarin, There are abundance of great Cantonese Chinese restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the Peach Blossoms in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant that's found a home at the Marina Mandarin, with tastefully ambience, unique blend of warm and cool tones, and a modern, sophisticated very comfortable place where you can enjoy an authentic fine dining experience. It is a distinctive but good up-market Cantonese fine dining restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. One of the dish that really stand out was the Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel Chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth! .The restaurant also offers a Weekday All-You-Can-Eat Dim Sum lunch buffet .The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality fine dining Fusion Chinese cuisine. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food - The place is a bit smelly though,negative,30,1-Oct-13,"We were looking for a good indian place to have a quick bite at around 11 in the morning in the Little India area and decided to visit this place, having seen it so many times from the bus. The first impression as we entered the restaurant was about the strange pungent smell that was there in the restaurant (might have been because it was quiet early in the day). This was to a point that we thought of leaving without eating.We did stay and ordered. We ordered 2 dishes, 'Bhel Puri' & 'Regular Batore', though we were served Dahi Puri instead of Bhel Puri (and I am not someone who sends things back, afterall we are there for the good time). The food did actually turn out quiet good. The Dahi Puri's flavor was a bit all over the place and the chutneys and sweet yogurt didnt complement each other too well. The Batoore were a total treat. We loved it. Though we may not go back to this place (despite of the good food) because of the whole smell in the place."

French,Saveur,"Small portions, reasonably priced",positive,40,21-Apr-14,"The six of us tried several starters (Earth) and several mains (both Land and Seas).All of us agreed the Grilled Octopus was good, while opinions were more divided on the Caesar and Tuna.The Creamy Pork was tender and tasty, although the pasta could be better. The Beef Oyster Blade was juicy and tender, and the Salmon nicely done. We were less enthusiastic about the risotto but the Funghi and Crab were both quite good.The portions are rather small, so it's a good idea to share a few starters, but prices are very reasonable and service is quite good.The restaurant gets crowded so reservations would be a good idea."
French,Paul,Terrible service and unprofessional staff,negative,10,16-Dec-17,"Went to Paul for dinner but it’s a shame I did not manage to try their food as we left due to bad and unprofessional service. Decided on what to order and waved for the service staff to take our order but did not assist us till we asked for the second time.A full timer came over and did not apologise for keeping us waiting and when we finally get to order the menu we wanted, the waiter smugged and mentioned that it is not available without recommending what is good and available.Avoid this place at all cost as we as paying customers do not deserve this kind of service standard of service staff."

Poach prawns - Fresh and well preparedCombined this with gracious service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng:1. We were initially allotted a table in a tight space. She moved us to a bigger table when it became available.2. Due to misunderstanding, she allowed us to change our initial order without any fush. Most other places would simply say ""Already prepared"".3. Other staff members are attentive and gracious. Perhaps because of their prominent name tags which provide them with an identity and pride in their work.Overall a great experience. We spent $380 for a party of 5 adults and 2 kids. Would say it is value for money. If the management is reading this, please pass on the compliments to Jenny Cheng and her team."

Get a bus further up Bukit Timah Rd to Adam road and try the hawker there - it's so much better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Severe food poisoning from chilli crab,negative,10,14-Jan-14,"We got into Singapore from Australia as a stop over on the way to London and decided to sample the 'must-do' things in Singapore on our short visit. We had heard that sampling the chilli crab from one of the bigger hawker centres is well worth it, so we asked our concierge which is the best place, and were advised to try Newton, as another popular centre is undergoing refurbishment.We arrived and were pleasantly surprised that the ""aggressive selling"" that we had been warned about was not the case - apparently there has been a crackdown on this. People will encourage you, gently, to read their menu, but to be honest, I was expecting and almost disappointed to not have to engage in friendly banter and got the feeling the stall owners were holding back due to the new rules.We walked around for 20 minutes and eventually selected a stall, spoke with the owner and ordered the crab. It was ok (we have high standards), and we finished it, paid and left feeling happy. The middle of the night saw an end to that! I have never been so ill, and my wife was almost as bad. I won't bore you with the gory details but needless to say we were violently ill for 2 days with acute gastroenteritis, and almost unable to get our flight to London. We saw a doctor and I was close to being admitted to hospital due to dangerous dehydration (what a nightmare that would have been!).In short, be very careful before deciding to eat here. It's worth seeing one of the markets, but maybe better to get a sealed, commercially produced drink from one of the vendors rather than risk what we went through - it was just awful and ruined our trip to Singapore, as we spent the entire time running between bed and bathroom.As an aside, we stayed in the Mandarin Oriental, who could not have been better. Apart from it being a stunning hotel, the staff went out of their way to assist us during our illness, and gave us a late checkout of 8pm on the day of departure so we could go straight from bed to the airport. I look forward to going back to Singapore, and staying in the Mandarin Oriental again, but will most likely give the hawker centres a miss next time!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Tandoori Parata,negative,30,15-May-12,We had ok curry but GREAT tandoori parata here while on transit in Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs,positive,50,11/9/2017,The best pepper crabs in Singapore. We also had the wasabi prawns and Kayla which were superb. A must visit in Singapore
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian Pure Vegetarian & Jain food restaurant in Singapore!,positive,40,16-Oct-12,"We visit this restaurant regularly & this is one of the best North Indian Pure Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore. Also, serving food without onion & garlic. Quality of food is very good & it is very tasty! ;)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Why spoil it with silly add on charges,positive,40,04/21/14,"Really nice, freshly cooked dim sum in authentic surroundings. No complaints, we visit here once or twice each year and it's consistently good but why oh why do they add on for a tiny bowl of peanuts on the table and for the service totes, 2.00 peanuts and 60 cents for each serviette. No big deal just silly. In addition to the dim sum menu we always ask for a bowl of plain rice which is great value at 1 dollar so we shall continue to visit."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic Chennai Taste in heart of Singapore,positive,40,26-Dec-14,Softest yummiest melt in your mouth Idlis served with piping hot Sambar and an assortment of four lip-smacking Chutneys! Never mind the basic infrastructure as the food more than makes up for it.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh,positive,40,8-Jun-17,Food was fresh and varieties of food was great! Space was abit small though. Atmosphere was very cozy but tables are quite near to one another.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",go for the fish heads,positive,40,6-Jul-09,Had fish head curry and fish head tandori. (preferred the curry version but both were good). Easy to overorder. stick with the fish heads and rice and a vegetable and it will still be too much food.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Delicious indian food,positive,40,25-Apr-16,"Visited this place twice, recently with my family. The dishes here are generally tasty and delicious if you are into spicy and gravy-heavy food. The papadum is my favourite appetizer!
Try the naan and briyani, eat them with tandoori chicken or curry fish head. Include...More"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food standard till good service better,positive,40,2/1/2016,"Had breakfast on 30/1/16 duck noodle, porridge some tim sum. The duck bun still good and so is the custard bun serve pipping hot yum yum, love it. For 4 pax we spend $67.00 also have some duck wing, carrot cake , chicken feet, dough fritter.Good place for tim sum."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Excellent roast duck,positive,50,01/29/17,Excellent roast duck. That's what this restaurant is famous for. Located at the basement of the Scott Square.
French,L_Angelus,Pas Symapthetique.,negative,30,1-Dec-13,"It was my first time in L'Angelus for a couple of years,and it was disappointing.My previous memories of the restaurant had been happy ones but I thought the quality of the food had declined from what I remember.The evening began well-the decor is attractive,the greeting welcoming and the service attentive.The free taster of a fish mayonnaise was good.Our starters of pasta and of pate were bland,lacking in interest but not unpleasant.My main course of lamb was similarly bland and my companion's of duck confit was dry and uninteresting.The dessert we shared,a rum baba,was not to our liking at all,though maybe that was just our taste buds.The house wines we tried,a Cote du Rhone and a Bordeaux,were satisfactory.I think perhaps a problem with L'Angelus is that the menu is too large.The best restaurants in France have a small menu:I have even been in restaurants where there is no choice,you just get served what is available today,what has been bought fresh in the market that day.A menu this large pre-supposes that dishes are pre-prepared to a great degree,and thus lacking in freshness and usually originality."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very popular with the locals,positive,40,4/8/2013,This group of restraurant ..have a wide range of cusine ..from very down to earth to the exotic ..better check on thier website before you head out ...extremely popular for familt celebrations
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night might be different,positive,40,17-Oct-11,"I was there during lunch hours, and quite a few of the vendors were closed. I ordered a BBQ stingray and it was pretty good. It was about 12SGD. The place was clean and nice but hopefully a night experience would have been better."
French,L_Angelus,Nice and quiet environement in a French traditional deco.,positive,40,17-Mar-17,"Very good food for value. Traditional French plates.
The food menu is not taking you too long to read and choose so it is appreciable especially when what ever you take, you will be satisfy by the food."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Delicacy ,positive,50,26-Jul-17,For the first time of my life I finished all the gingers and probably the most I have ever had! Friendly waitress kindly answered my question about the finger wipe. The sushi is just amazing. Would be better if the chef presents them with more languages than Japanese. In the end I'm just not full...
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",South Indian Food,positive,40,24-Feb-15,If you are looking for vegetarian or South Indian food then this place will be right place for that. We tried Dosa and lassi over there and taste was good. Being an Indian we feel proud when we get Indian food and restaurant in abroad.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good. Same as one in India. Slow service,positive,40,22-Oct-17,"The kailash parbat at singapore is able to maintain quality similar to the one they provide in India. However service very very slow.
Overall good experience."
French,Paul,Very disappointing,negative,20,22-Jun-17,"Looks good, but service was really slow and the pastries not that great. A real disappointment as it looked promising."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food and good services,positive,40,03/24/17,But the restaurant did not received my chope reservation. Luckily there are enough seats for 7 of us.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Seafood I've eaten in a long time,positive,50,3/5/2017,"Long Beach Dempsey has got to be one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long, long time. It's very much a 'get your hands dirty and stuck in' kind of place. We started with their signature black pepper crab and it was a real treat. Succulent, steaming hot and with just the right amount of spice!We also had the bean curd with chef's sauce, crispy duck, grouper, and durian pudding amongst other things. All of them a delight. The waitron staff are attentive and ensure that your Tiger Beer pitchers are never empty. A wonderful culinary experience. No wonder it's considered a Singapore institution. "
French,Saveur,"Good Food, Service was a little slow",positive,40,9-Jul-17,"Food was good, enjoyed my meal. however, service was a little slow. it could have also been due to the fact that it was a Friday night, and there were many customers they had to serve. overall, still quite a pleasant experience."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Signature buns and great char siu,positive,40,06/14/15,"Crowded with long queues so be prepared to wait! The most memorable dish was the signature buns - black pepper duck and crispy London duck. They are baked with a crisp outer crust, soft bread and juicy tasty filling. The barbecue pork with honey (char siu) was delectable. The Signature London roast duck was quite good though we would have preferred it deboned. Give the congee and tim sum items a miss. Have definitely tasted better. There is only one dessert, mango purée with sago and this was refreshing if somewhat average. The prices are very reasonable and service is energetic and fast. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Beijing Duck was superb,positive,40,08/20/15,"We ate there on our first evening in Singapore and were not dissapointed.
We were well explained and advised, and the food was good.
Expensive, especially the drinks, as everythere in that area."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Thank you Chef Ishi ! See you soon,positive,50,24-Oct-15,"The Chef Ishi do is best and more so that you spent a memorable evening.And it is the case.Sushi seems today very simple because very popular but a real sushi it is very complicate and so rare !Here eveything is perfection. The choice and the quality of fishs, the cutting of those one and the slightly tepid rice basing in mouth.But I have to deliver an important message. This place is for Wealthy Connaisseurs. WHY ?Because they are probably the best sushis that I ate ever all arround the world including Japan. But the excellence has a price !.It is thus necessary to have a developed palace if you wish to keep a fantastic memory at the time of the bill ($ 800.- for 2)I'll go back"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab..... Yum!!!,positive,40,05/22/15,"We asked the concierge of our hotel where we could get the best Crab in Singapore. Long Beach Dempsey was the recommendation and we were not disappointed. Not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded!Bustling, full of locals and whilst the service is no fuss the wait staff were happy to take time out to explain the dishes. They took pleasure in your curiosity and enjoyment.Exceptional value for money."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Overrated - you can find better for less,negative,30,09/13/17,"Our friends had gone here and recommended it and so we booked through the concierge at our hotel who told us it was upscale casual. It's casual casual with slippers and t-shirts. It's the kind of restaurant that they place food on your table that you haven't ordered and will charge you for it unless you say something. We ordered the chilli crab, med order of prawns, med order of noodles, vegetables and 4 beers and it came to $240 singapore dollars. There is however a restaurant 5 minutes walk away called the Red Dot that has great live music and a good vibe!!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but average for the rest,negative,30,29-Jul-18,"Food is ordered by tablet, seems to have inconsistency in arrival time for foods but mostly served quite quickly. Sashimi is served cold and fresh so that was very good. The BBQ skewers were not so good, they were served just a little warmed up. Seating was quite good. Even though it was quite busy, we have good spacing between all tables."

Prices are reasonable."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lives upto the exprectations always!,positive,40,2-Jan-16,"We have celebrated many occasions - my birthday, our anniversary, took mom-dad and casual Friday lunch with office mates. And we celebrated New Year 2016 dinner here too.The place always lives upto the expectations. Amazing Chaat items - Sev Puri Chaat, Veg starters - Paneer Plack pepper. I simply love the daal makhni here. Diwani Handi was also good.Enjoyed Rabdi to the core in the deserts. It is a proper dine-in restaurant with pleasing ambiance. May appear expensive to some but it is the price for food and place.The only advice I would like to make to the management is, they need to improve the service level consistently. Train employees how to deal with situations and improve the level of attentiveness towards customers, kind advice since we are regular visitors. Hire part timers for weekends and special occasions if that helps!"
French,Saveur,Saveur is good as always!,positive,50,4-Feb-18,"Outlet is now just called Saveur at Cathay. Food is good as usual, though the ambience feels different compared to the other saveur outlets. This Cathay outlet feels abit more industrial/unpolished."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Better atmosphere on the week end,positive,40,09/17/12,"Nice chinese restaurant with good food, lot of chinese people come during the week end with their family all the generation together, the old women serve you, kids like so much !"
French,Paul,Breakfast meeting,positive,40,20-May-18,"I am a regular customer of Paul and i have patronise paul in many asian and european countries. I must say, compared to the outlets that i have visited in France, Malaysia or even back in my hometown Jakarta; Paul Takashimaya is definately one of the best.I had breakfast meeting for 8 people last week. We arrived earlier before the opening time and the staff on duty was pleasant, welcoming and accommodative. All of us agreed that everything from the coffee, crossiant, breakfast menu and desserts was magnificent. I personally had cafe mocha, eggs benedict and a mini crossiant. The cafe mocha was creamy, chocolaty and strong. The eggs benedict was simply matchless and the mini crossiant was buttery, fresh and tasted exactly like the ones i had in France. Service was extremely good and fast. Good ambience and easily accessible, i would highly recommend this to my friends."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Extremely bad experience,negative,10,24-Dec-15,We searched this place on google maps and were happy to know that there is a 24 hours vegetarian restaurant near Mustafa Center.

French,Paul,Disappointing,negative,30,4-Apr-15,"yes its a franchise, but goodness me it's dull. The food is not exciting, with no flare or attention paid to it. Paul is a popular chain in the UK and feels much better. This place was average"
French,Saveur,Attractive price,negative,30,12-Feb-17,Prices are pretty awesome for French cuisine. But we were not particularly wowed by the food quality. But I suppose u get what u pay for.
French,Paul,Poor customer service,negative,10,10-Dec-15,"We visited Paul with my family during lunchtime. There was lots of customers. The customer service is very poor, we requested the waiter to check the espresso & the strawberry pastry after the rest of food out. It took 10 minutes with 2 & 3 different waiters to assist this small matter. I suggested that the management should educate the waiter that 1 waiter should finish their task, but not 2 or 3 waiters finish 1 task. Besides this, bill payment also took 10 minutes & let customer to wait & wait. Actually all the pastries are ready-made, they need to take & serve customers directly. The pastries are nice! However, the attitude of the waiters draws the customers away. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",More expensivd,positive,40,4-Mar-18,"I normally eat at their main restaurant at Race Course Road. Besides being smaller, it’s still the same great food, attentive service but I think might be a little more expensive and not such a wide menu."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Inconsistent and unpredictable, but usually good",positive,40,24-Mar-16,"This restaurant's ala carte buffet has an excellent selection of dishes at a rather reasonable price tag. The only problem is the standards that vary on different days of the week and sometimes even on the same evening.Most of the time, the sashimi is sweet and fresh - there was only one occasion where I thought the fish could have been fresher. The temaki selection is wonderful but wildly inconsistent - the same dish ordered a second time might not be as good as the first. If it's good, the seaweed is crunchy. The kabocha chawanmushi (pumpkin egg custard) is usually excellent with the right consistency, but if you're unlucky you will get a watery version. The Gyuniku Shogayaki is very tasty as is the agedashi tofu. If you can afford the cholesterol, try the Uzura Shioyaki (grilled quail eggs with salt). The tori teppan and Asari Shiru are also must -trys. The tempura is nothing to shout about, unfortunately. Despite the unpredictable standard, I'd still recommend this place as the dishes hit the spot most of the time. And the price is inexpensive, considering the variety."
French,Paul,Typical Breakfast Fare without the Hipster Queues,negative,30,12-Mar-17,"I have visited Paul bakery a number of times with family and friends. They have a reliable stable of food options. The quality of food options are great, but not amazing. Their menu is rather pricey for the quality of food, but that is understandable since it is a foreign ""upmarket-ish"" kind of chain.My usual go-to's for a French breakfast are croissants or Pain Au Chocolat. On this occasion, I ordered a Pain Au Chocolat and a Palmier. The Pain Au Chocolat is lackluster and the DIY frozen options from the Tanglin Food Market taste way better. The Palmier is reminiscent of Tiong Bahru Bakery's Kouign Amann. It was good, flakey and buttery, but I very much prefer the Kouign Amann, although they are two different items.Overall, Paul is a good option if one wants a breakfast without the hype and crowd of a hipster place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average quality fare,negative,30,9-Jan-17,"Decided to visit this joint as I saw that it was voted as one of the best buffet restaurants by Chope. Also, because the entertainer app has 1-1 buffet lunch, I thought it would be worth a try.The food was just average in my opinion though they have quite a good variety of items on the buffet menu. None of the items were exceptionally good, more like mass produced food type of quality. Service was good, the staff was prompt in serving and clearing. The experience reminds me of Nihon Mura. While the value is there, I doubt I will be returning anytime soon."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Sindhi food at its best,positive,50,13-Oct-16,"Excellent food

French,Paul,Paul Offers a Wide Choice of Food in Singapore the Service Disappoints,negative,30,26-Jul-15,"Paul is a well established restaurant. From France to China to Singapore you can find their outlets. The food is generally good and the seating area comfortable. All this is true in Singapore until the pleasure of the visit suffers problems with delivering the service. It is not intentional but it is noticeable. While this may have been a flat patch in their service at Tangling Mall and just been an off day, it did detract from the visit. Would we visit Paul restaurants again, very likely."

Attentive sevice.
Had set menu -glass of wine ;mixed leaves with walnuts in tasty dressing; fabulous steak, perfectly cooked medium rare in a tasty sauce.

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic Tamil food,positive,50,24-Jun-18,"Visited in a Saturday afternoon.

Delightful flavour! Also had their signature pasta which was not bad either.I was however, disappointed that they no longer have a pasta heavy menu... ;( wanted to try more after my first visit years ago.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good place for Vegetarian Indian Food.,positive,40,1-May-14,"We went to this place on two consecutive days. On First day we wanted to order some chinese dishes, But the manager declined saying that Chinese Chef was absent. Next day the chinese chef was there. All the items there were good. Starters, Main Course and Chinese dishes all were very good. Service was a touch slow but still nice place to have authentic Indian cuisine."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mother's Day Dinner,positive,40,5/12/2016,"We ordered from the ala carte menu and we felt that it was more valued for money than the set menu. We had cod fish for many of the dishes and I must say, the food was fresh and definitely tasty. The only pity thing is that the portion is too small, even the large portion was too small for a table of 11 + 1 child. Food was also served very slowly. Although it allowed us to have ample time to sample the dishes, the serving pace could be faster. Would not mind going back for another meal to try out some dishes which I did not have a chance to order."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Won't Queue For This,negative,30,11/21/16,"We went on a weekend and was fortunate we didn't have to queue for a table. The menu is focused mainly on the duck, roast meats, some noodle dishes and mainly dim sum. I wasn't impressed by the quality of the dim sum. The roast meats were better. The famous roast duck is pretty tender and tasty although I do find the duck to be on the skinny side. The food is not too bad but I won't queue for it should I visit the next time. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A shame to call it London . .,negative,30,8/2/2015,"I have lived many year in London,"" though many years ago "". . and love the duck served in the Chines restaurants there. The duck here does not live up to any that I have had in London, in any restaurants there.I like the buns with a sweet black peber crust though . and i am glad I went for these.I will only go if I was close by . . again"
French,Paul,"Overpriced, Over-rated and terrible",negative,10,30-Dec-16,"The header simply says it all. I was with the wife. We have had a long day of christmas shopping. And we were there on a not so busy weekday afternoon.So, no crowd, no one in line for seats, not even packed. In fact, it was fairly empty. We found a table we liked, and told the waitress. It took them 10 minutes to clear and clean the table. Ok ok ok ok... 10 minutes .. I am too demanding you say. My wife went to the display glass cabinet to look at the 'sumptious pastries and other deli offerings' . I sat, and waited for the waiting staff to come back and provide menu. I was thirsty and wanted to at least order a drink while awaiting for my wife to come back to the table. I look around, no staff. Finally saw 2 of them walking around. And I waved my hand, but it seems like I was invisible. Finally after I stood up and walked towards them, they noticed me. I am surprised. Not even a crowded afternoon, and it seems like they were not wanting to have eye contact with the patrons. I saw an elderly couple also (like me) waving for their attention. Oh well, maybe my hand was short, and maybe my skin complexion blended into the background and they didnt notice me.So I ordered 2 coffees, 1 capuccino. I waited for about 30 minutes before the coffee came (and it was LUKEWARM). I asked the waitress to change the coffee for me as i told them it was not even hot. It must have been sitting on the counter for awhile. We ordered a sandwhich, of which I couldn't be bothered to remember now because it tasted dry and horrible. Overall conclusion, give this place a miss. Terrible service, poor quality food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice food with so many options [Pure veg],positive,50,28-Mar-17,it was nice experience to have dinner at Kailash parbat. There were so many options to choose from. Chat platter was good. its mid-range on price point

The fish head curry is recommend here."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chili Crab,positive,40,12/26/16,There are more famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore but I like Long Beach for an overall great Chili Crab night out. I love the Chili Crab and fried bread with a few frosty Tigers. It's also convenient from Orchard Road and has plenty of parking. I've taken a lot of visitors to Long Beach and it's always been good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Mixed feelings ,negative,30,25-Jan-18,I have been to this restaurant a number of times of the years. It feels like they still have the same ambitions but can’t really handle it. At the beginning of my dinner the service was top notch but as the place filled up I saw less and less of my waiter at the end they didn’t emptied the table before I got the check. Foie gras was ok the meat was ok the French fries was really good. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese restaurant,negative,30,27-Feb-12,"Japanese restaurant offering an extensive menu at a reasonable all-in price. Diners are given 4 types of order forms to indicate their choices of raw seafood items, grilled dishes, etc. They can send additional orders thereafter. Desserts are available -- with an additional charge! We found the service good at first, but slower and less efficient as the restaurant became more crowded. Sashimi choices are rather limited, fresh-tasting and generally good in quality but not in presentation. Ambience and decor are satisfactory."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Poor serve food pace,negative,10,6/3/2018,"Still hungry after 1.5 hrs due to poor serve pace. Staff unattentive. Teapot too heavy to self serve at full pot, might break fingers. Pretty ex for substandard service. Forget to serve some dishes as well. Serve muslim indonesian maid pork porridge instead of ordered fish porridge."
French,Paul,Improved service,positive,40,17-Apr-18,"Came to Paul over the weekend, tried the brunch. It was very good and value for money. Service has improved, server was very prompt, the portion was very generous and we really loved the burn orange ice tea"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food was great!,positive,50,30-Apr-18,"I can honestly not say anything about the prices and or whether or not you're being ripped off as a tourist, as we went with a local who ordered (and paid :-)) for us - but the food was very yumm! We had a variety of local dishes, among them carrot cake, oyster omelette and fried yellow noodles. All of it was very good. All in all, we found this place a lot less touristx than the Telok Ayer Food Centre for example."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mr Ken Yeo,positive,50,06/14/17,Called to reserved a table for 2 at Peach Blossoms for dinner at Sunday 11/6 by a friendly manager Terry Lim. ... food was good and delicious especially the dessert was quite Creative with dry ice splitting smoke .. the staffs service was excellent and thoughtful cos when I order too much food they even remind me of it. Thinking of trying their lunch for the Tim Sum next time
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Freaky expensive and dishonest,negative,10,02/22/12,"We came for a professional dinner. The Chinese maid had inaudible English. She gave advices on our menu, changing it five times without we requested it. At the end, for 6 persons, the bill amount was 1100 SGP dollars. They charged napkins, deserts separately from menu and so on... INSANE"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Little India experience,positive,50,19-Oct-14,"Could not have picked a better place for fine Indian food, the open chef station is great to watch while they prepare your dishes too. Excellent food, nice atmosphere too and friendly waiters."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Amazing!,positive,50,5-Jun-18,"Wow, what can do say! I wish I lived next door!The food is amazing and the service is good. We had puni puri, chole bhature, tandoor paneer, kulfi and ras malai. Everything was amazingly good. I also had a mango lassi. I am not usually into lassi but this one was wonderfully thirst quenching! I am looking forward to my next visit and there are so many dishes in want to try! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in town,positive,50,28-Jun-16,"We have been to Shinji by Kanesaka for several occasions and every time, the food was excellent. Though pricey, the quality of the fish is well worth the money. If you want to have a once in a lifetime sushi experience while in Singapore, choose the chef's menu and enjoy the freshest fish in town."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,negative,30,26-Jul-16,"Great atmosphere but average food.
Had the buffet, unfortunately i feel that the food range is not wide enough."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),PEACHY,positive,50,09/27/13,Lovely food & ambience. The menu is extensive & there are also set menus for those who can't decide. The real birds outside in the atrium sing for you during the daylight hours - just enjoy!
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Traditional South Indian Food,positive,50,12-May-17,Great Experience. Excellent South Indian food. Very Traditional and highly recommend for those visiting Singapore and on a look out for South Indian Food !
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not that gd,negative,10,22-Mar-17,"Variety of food is limited. Taste of food is so-so, definitely not worth the price. Will not go again. With that lunch pricing, I can get a better Japanese restaurant and better food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore Chilli Crab,positive,40,14-Oct-17,"Newton Hawker Centre was recommended and the Singapore Chilli Crab as the dish you should try. Well the place has a lot of budget meals and eateries, but the hawkers do not relent, you want to look at a menu and prices and they want to sit you down and shove a meal in front of you. Found a place for chilli Crab, most places charge $5 per 100gram of crab weight. Advice is to see Crab and get an estimate of weight and cost before you order, we did about face and paid the price. The meal was very good, did not have to wait long. After our meal we got our bill and to our surprise it was not what we expected. the Crab was nowhere near half a kilo let alone we paid for over a kilo. There is a large selection of meals and they start around $4, select a couple of dishes and you have a good meal. A wide variety Indian, Malay, chinese and Singaporean. Alcohol is also available."
French,L_Angelus,A truly French experience in Singapore!,positive,40,4-Mar-15,"We had a brilliant meal here at the beginning of February. We found the setting and atmosphere of the place to be sufficiently French to make us forget we were not in Paris. The food and wines were of a very high quality. The service was also very French, i.e. somewhat stiff and formal (what a shame they're too proud to learn from the Italians!).If you are in Singapore and are looking for a proper ""French"" restaurant, then look no further than l'Angelus. It is extremely good – but be careful, the bill may be larger than you were expecting."
French,Saveur,Saveur the Cathay,negative,30,16-Jul-17,"They had a few new dishes. The duck confit burger (new dish) was alright, but the duck confit main was not as good as I remembered. Shame.
Seeing it was a Friday evening, we were surprised by the lack of crowd too.
Thank you."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner with Friends,negative,30,18-Sep-17,"The atmosphere of the Duxton outlet was great, had pretty high expectations after having a fantastic meal at their Suntec branch (now closed) a few years ago.They wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived but did make allowances when we mentioned that it was a birthday surprise and we would like to be seated before the birthday girl made her grand appearance. Ordering and the delivery of food was fast. We were told while placing our orders that those who were sharing the XXL steak meal weren't allowed to have free flow fries, something that we understood and were absolutely okay with. What we were not expecting was that those who shared meals were not allowed to request for extra sauce for the steak, this was pretty ridiculous to us as we felt that we should at least be able to request for 1 extra serving of sauce per set meal - further more the steak was bland. Did not expect this kind of skimpy service from a restaurant that I presumed was more upmarket.Overall had an average night at L'Entrecôte."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea food,positive,40,11/2/2015,Long Beach @ Dempsey is really easy to get to but do make sure you book as it does get very busy especially weekends and holidays. You can either request to sit out doors or inside the restaurant. Evenings in Singapore are pleasant so it's not a problem. I love the chilli crab so that's always one dish I order.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value for money,positive,40,23-Apr-17,Food quality has improved greatly since our last visit one year ago. And it continues to be great value for money with the birthday one-for-one a la carte buffet lunch promotion on weekdays.

The price was...More
French,Saveur,"Overall satisfied, however prefer Far East outlet",positive,40,28-Aug-17,"Taste not as good. Service is ok, however for Chope reservation/discount, the crew have to consult the manager, perhaps should train all to be familiarize with the system. More effective! Better customer service can be archive"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",perfect for a weekend breakfast- if you love idlis!!!!!,positive,40,14-Apr-10,one of the best places in Singapore for idlis and the perfect cuppa south indian filter coffee. go with an open mind- the place is tiny and a no-frills restaurant. but the food more than makes up for it. very economical. very limited menu though!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Favourite for >35 years. Still Excellent!,positive,50,26-Jun-13,"I've been going to Newton since 1977 when I began going to a school in the area, and it's still my hawker centre of choice when I return from my new home in Melbourne.It may be slightly more expensive than other more-local hawker centres, but it offers a great array of choice and the food is generally of very good quality. Singaporeans will sometimes complain of quality on the basis that locals often look for 'best of breed' in dishes, and Newton may not have a replica of ""mum's lamb roast"". Having said that, as far as I am concerned Bee Heng Popiah and Heng Carrot Cake (try the white version with chilli) are outstanding, and the best of their kind in Singapore. Wash those dishes down with sugar can juice and it'll cost you $10-15 at most and put a wide smile on your face.Is it touristy (as is the occasional complaint)? All of Singapore is, and not more so at Newton. In fact, it's typically filled with locals until about 10pm, when more tourists start filing in.Newton has never disappointed me (except when my favourite stalls are closed! - I think on Tuesdays). Don't miss it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great sea food!,positive,50,10-Oct-13,"All of their seafood was so delicious, very fresh. Especially their signature Sea urchin: it looked tough outside with all those spikes, but inside, it was sweet and tender. The service, for sure, was great. The view at night was amazing too."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hassle free ordering,positive,40,27-Jul-17,"Food was alright, the tempura a little oily. Servers sent food to wrong tables. Had to place order twice before I got my food. Very convenient to order thru ipad. Saves the trouble of calling the waiter. Waiter did not understand that I wanted soya sauce to put the wasabi in. Gave me a whole dish of wasabi. Need more training. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Mixed opinion, one dish good and other dish is bad",negative,30,14-Oct-15,"First time went and had Jaipur Biryani. It was good. Second time went to other restaurant near Mustafa. Taste sucks. Tried chat platter. It was not very good. Heard great reviews and recommendations. However recently had food in a friends place catered Kailash parbat, it was great. Very inconsistent."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Completely Underwhelming,negative,20,06/22/11,"I was keen to try some Chili Crab in Singapore and was recommended to try here. Wrong choice. The staff weren't that interested in whether I was there or not. Apart from plonking some peanuts and napkin on the table (which was later charged to me) no one took my order for food or drink for 20 minutes, and the crab took another half hour to arrive. I don't know what Chili Crab is supposed to be, but the 'hero' of the dish ie the crab was lost in a mass of chili sauce. Picking your way through the crab to get some tasty morsels was messy ( I needed another 4 napkins to keep cleaning my hands) and the crab's flavour was bland. The chili sauce was too sweet, and not enough heat to even raise some sweat on the brow. I had to go back into town and grab an icecream sandwich to console myself."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",a lot of food choice,positive,40,18-Apr-17,"if you don't know where to eat or what to eat. just try to go to this hawker centre. you can take mrt and alight at newton station take exit b. there was a lot of food to choice. seafood, laksa, mee, oyster, beer and etc. if you craving for seafood i thought that this place is cheaper than many restaurant. and the food was delicious. and don't forget to find your sit first, remember your seat number. order your food and mention your seat number."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food-another dish reviewed:),positive,40,7-Feb-17,"Have already written about their palak paneer and Chole - we also recently tasted their Awadhi Biryani last weekend - and it was superb! Made in authentic style, this has a good quantity of gravy vegetables and rice..we ended up overeating that day:) Also want to point out- Jyoti and Chandradev are two of the best folks out there in case you do visit. Very helpful and efficient."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious Indian Food,positive,40,23-Nov-17,"Ambience of the restaurant is good ,and staff is also nice with quick service. I have tried there samosa chats and pannipuri both was good. Excellent Quality of food- Excellent Service- Excellent Value for money.Highly Recommended ,,,,"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go before 6pm,negative,30,27-Dec-12,"We arrived approximately 1500 to find only about 10% of the store were open for business, luckily we found michaels little shop who provided us sting ray, calamari, prawns and chili mud crab. All of the above we're cooked we'll and tasted fantastic, with bags of flavour. Value was not fantastic but service was very helpful.Not a bad place to visit, just come in the evening when every thing is open "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Street food is average,negative,30,19-Oct-12,"Their street Chaat items on their menu are elaborate, but expensive for $ 12 which is the price for a snack only...The main course is just average. Had taken my parents when they came but it do not think we would ever go back there as the food is very very average and prices overrated considering Singapore's wide choice of indian restaurants with very good food and prices.We personally would never go there given a choice."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Japanese food,positive,50,11-Dec-17,"I have been to Shin Minori several times in the past. Always a great experience. Last week I had a visiting colleague from Japan (native Japanese). I decided to take him to Shin Minori. High risk, right ? Never take someone from a foreign country, familiar with how their food should be, to a restaurant of their heritage, for them to compare against, right ?I had confidence in Shin Minori, as my prior experiences were all great.My friend gave Shim Minori 2 thumbs up! (I wasn't all that surprised!).The sushi, Temaki (hand rolls) were great (but how can you mess up raw fish,right?). The cooked meals were also great (and that was where the real challenge was). Tori Wasabi Mayo (Grilled chicken with wasabi mayo), Kani Tenpura (soft shell crab), Yaki Onigiri (Grilled minced chicken balls), so many other items to choose from, all great.Great service. Great ambiance."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellence in Food.,positive,50,25-Dec-14,"Excellent food - with SO MANY options! There is something for everyone - from spicy Indian food (chaat, etc.) to classic, but very tasty, Western food (sandwiches)! Fast and wonderful service - everyone is always so happy to serve us. Not too expensive and absolute value for money! Brilliant."
French,Paul,You can do better Paul,negative,30,17-Sep-15,"I have visited a few of these outlets around the world. When it turned up the food was very good. The issue was it kind of came as and when, rather than hot meals for separate guests turning up together. Unfortunate apparent use of microwave added to the disappointment. The confit duck was lovely, the sides though were lacklustre and you do pay a premium in Singapore so I wont let that go. The layered potato bake sauce had separated, it was lukewarm and had been microwaved. The mushrooms on potato rosti that my friend had appeared to be OK, just OK. Then to dessert. The dark chocolate tart was awesome, so nice that it had to have an opposite to go with it. The lemon meringue tart looked like a properly made meringue on the menu, the reality was piped soggy meringue hit with a blow torch for a minute. Then ordering coffee, the coffee was OK, in french style though I requested cream, was told OK and then milk arrived. When questioned, no cream was available, so why say yes twice...Again, just not good enough. So, not rushing back and lots and lots of options in this shopping centre as well."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Same as original,positive,50,22-Aug-16,Great south indian food. If you eat the idli or any other item and close your eyes it will be difficult to imagine that you are not in Chennai but Singapore. Obviously its a bit expensive but great food and quick service hallmark of Murgan...More
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Have you really had fine dining if you haven't dined at Waku Ghin!,positive,50,29-Jun-16,"We planned our entire Singapore travel schedule around our Waku Ghin reservation and there was definitely a huge build up to it.. Lucky for us, Waku Ghin didn't disappoint and it was certainly a meal of a lifetime. Service was impeccable, the seafood as fresh as can be, and the flavour combinations simply outstanding."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grab your table first!,positive,40,9-Jan-15,"You MUST visit Newton Circus when you go to Singapore. It's an experience you'll get nowhere else in the world. Hundreds of stalls selling every imaginable food at reasonable (for tourists) prices. The atmosphere is amazing and you'll not be disappointed by the quality or choice of food. The only advice I can give is to go in pairs (at least), walk round first to see what you fancy eating, then one of you grab a table while the other orders from the stalls. This way, you'll not be looking for somewhere to site when you food is ready."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The best restaurant in the world,positive,50,6-Sep-17,We went to this restaurant not long after it had opened. While it is expensive it is the most amazing dining experience we have ever had. Food was totally different from most other restaurants but absolutely beautifully presented and had the best flavour ever.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide spread of ala carte buffet,negative,30,21-Sep-17,"There were many choices to choose from if someone like variety. However, I find the sushi is average."
French,Paul,Tea party ,negative,10,22-Apr-18,"Most disappointing Very poor service , while the quality of food has been enjoyable in the past today was really the worst I have ever experienced!!! Embarrassed to take friends there and not worth returning.How very sad for the person who made the initial effort to set up the restaurant."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Poor service and overpriced,negative,10,7-Apr-15,They add dal flour in chutneys to make it look dense. Surely overpriced taking advantage of the location. They still serve coffee in thermacoal cups! Saying no staff. Yucks!!! Totally profit minded.
French,L_Angelus,Very good and authentic French ,positive,50,9-Sep-16,"I discovered this French bistro invited for business lunch . I was pleasantly surprised . The food is not only excellent but also very well done . Guess the chef must be French or at least trained in France ! Some interesting touch of originality here and there ( a nice variation on "" bavette"" with a kind of coriander lemon condiment ) but great classics like cassoulet or roasted lamb with an exceptional ratatouille ( I love ratatouille, this one was great ). Dessert are well done and elegant on the plate . Another thing I liked was the wine list , good choice with some rare bottles, mainly Bordeaux old vintages , very decent in price . Speaking of price , they have a 68$ menu , the one I had , quite decent for Singapore if you check the quality . Bravo !"
French,Paul,Loving it,positive,50,26-Jun-17,"Good coffee, good croissant, good sandwiches and macaroons if you are sweet tooth person. Black coffee with croissant, your best teatime buddy!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satisfied,positive,40,23-Jul-14,"After skimming through several mixed reviews, i decided to go and experience Newton food center despite having my local friend said it's a ""tourist trap"".Once i'm there i was greeted by a throng of people. Luckily we got our seats after 5 minutes roaming around. We had chili stingray from the first stall at the entrance, bbq sotong at the stall that has a red LED, and oyster omelette from stall 28 (people say its the best).Price wise there might be cheaper hawker food centers but this one might be one of the most convenient (since its near the CBD), at least for tourists, anyway"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Most relished dim sums,positive,40,09/27/12,"This place lives upto its name - awesome dim sums and you will be spoilt for choice. the menu is very friendly, it has images of each of the dish.
Dessert recommendation - Egg Tarts."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good food but expensive!,positive,40,21-Oct-15,"Awesome food. Only problem is the rate. I had 4 idlys, 1 vada and 1 tea. They charged me 17$ which I feel is expensive. If you are craving for South Indian food especially idlys and vadas and you don't have any budget, this is...More"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good Overpriced Food,negative,30,3-Oct-17,The Food served here is good but it is surely overpriced..But it has an advantage of being open 24X7 so one can have a meal whenever he/she wants and its a vegetarian Indian Restaurant Just opposite Mustafa Centre
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Average food with average service,negative,20,26-Jul-15,"I have witnessed downfall in service in almost all places, not sure what's causing this decline.... Food was average ... Service was non existing ... Can't recommend this place to anyone"
French,Paul,Nice cafe w a good location but the service is sad,negative,30,22-Dec-16,"The brand and location attracts shoppers to stop for drink and bite. Place is nice , food is the norm. However, the service is really making me think twice about coming back here. Either this outlet is super under staff or they just are so busy and worn out look.. - there are empty tables but yet they took a long time to find seats for the patrons in the q - I had to actively look out for staff and asked 3staffs before order is taken- slow in taking order- slow in serving the beverage and cake -both plates actually are pretty worn out with stains on them  Perhaps they can have service staff to just serve some ice water/ warm water and let the guests know they be with them in a min to take order.. conclusion is Come if u got a lot of time to just wait and wait"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy,positive,50,21-Jul-16,Go to Mike with red hair... Delicious... Cannot recommend highly enough.. Chilli crab so good and a very good price!! Kids here on holiday and couldn't wait to go back.. Also stall next the lady who sells drinks so so nice
French,Saveur,Good food value for money,positive,40,12-Feb-17,"Good food. Value for money. Convenient location but ambience inside the restaurant could be better.
Good service. Nice music"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Like Eating in India,positive,50,13-Jun-15,"We ate dinner 3 to 4 times here. It was always quite crowded. The service is slow. However, the food was great. The Sindhi chappati were soft . They helped us by making the lasunibdaal less spicy .the choke bhatura was a delight. The pani puris are expensive but yummy. The mhich Di was uninspired and mehakta basmati rice was a bit oily. Gulabjamuns were spot on Dinner is after 7 only. Overall like eating back home in Mumbai and a definite must for the Vegetarian Indian traveller. The restaurant was right behind the Park Royal hotel at Farrer park where we were staying and definitely a great place to eat. it is expensive but less than a five star hotel and with more variety."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,lolno,negative,10,2/2/2018,"Terrible service. Not the impressive Yum Cha I remembered. We had not enough chairs for our group of 6, no space because the other table had their bags on a chair right next to our table, unable to move back because the tea/cutlery station was next to us. When we told the service staff, she basically gave us zero solutions. Move tables? Nope. Shift ours back? Nope. Tell the other group to move their bags? Nope, she actually said, “what do you want me to do?”. I legit just told you what to do!As if the experience isn’t bad enough, 2 of our ordered items wasn’t keyed in. Felt like I was boiling so much throughout the entire meal I was going to get indigestion. Why am I paying service charge?? I might as well go to a coffee shop jfc. Save yourself the headache and monies and go to Swee Choon instead. This place is going downhill. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beautiful Singapore Chilli Crab ,positive,40,11-Aug-15,"We came to the Hawker Centre to enjoy a more authentic meal rather than sitting I a high end restaurant ... And we weren't disappointed. After the initial negotiating to get a table we got sorted. Having a range of food and restaurants available, once I ordered from the 'owner' who secured us a table, my husband was able to go off and order what he wanted without the same pressure/hassling. It didn't worry me as I was on a mission to have chilli crab - and it was all I hoped it would be. I was promised that it wasn't too hot - and the promised was fulfilled. The sauce had a bit of a bite, but not too much. The crab had been cracked allowing the sauce to soak through ... So the flavour came through as I sucked out the crab. The only problem was trying to clean myself up afterwards. Little tissues only served as a temporary measure until I could get more serious.Restaurant 43, in a corner with a yellow background is a good place to head! And the Indian next door looked good - and tasted fine according to my husband."
French,Paul,Pricey food without quality!,negative,10,17-Jul-15,"Food: They gave me burnt wedges! the salads was normal, the sauce was normal, the food tasted almost like something from Fair Price or may be its from the BBQ section of Cold Storage. I ordered earl grey tea which taste like normal tea which doesn't have even a slight hint of citrus! Totally not worth the price! Service: The waitress doesn't really care to serve you even though there's no crowds."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",2nd Visit And Still Great,positive,40,2-Apr-17,"My 2nd time here.This place is quite hard to get to from train station. But I prefer to walk from Clarke Quay MRT station which will probably take about 15 mins walk. For tourist best is just to take a taxi, grab car or Uber. Location is at UE Square. Food generally are good. But do expect some waiting time during weekends as usually it will be packed with diners. Best to make reservations to avoid disappointment. Service staffs are friendly. So far so good. Price for buffet is at about SGD 50. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great place ,positive,50,31-Oct-15,Sushi bar. The entire family and extended clan decided it was one of the best sushi joints around. The sushi and sashimi were just very good. Do ask for their short-fin uni which was sweeter and really nice. Great service as well. It is cheaper during lunch rather than dinner. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good Dinner!,positive,40,12-Feb-16,"Visited this restaurant with a great expectation.
Ordered starters than main course.
Everything was good and service was great.
Little pricy but ok to pay since the taste was good.
Happy and satisfied customer!
Thanks.."
French,Paul,Disappointing and misleading menu,negative,10,31-Mar-18,"Restaurants from big chains to independent operators increasingly lure diners with menus declaring their “organic,” “locally-sourced,” and premium Wagyu beef status. Restaurants have the right to advertise food and beverage products to properly identify them. To misrepresent menu items is a violation of what is known as Truth in Menu laws. The issue is that you really don’t have a lot of enforcement for false advertising.Here at Paul in Ngee Ann City, it’s less lunch and more the incarnation of every Singaporean’s fearful suspicions about misleading menu. It’s verging on deceit. The smoked salmon on top of baked potato pancake in the menu turned out to be on pale, limp hash browns. Nowadays, it gets a little challenging to define some of these terms. That’s why it’s difficult to hold restaurants accountable who don’t serve what they say they’re serving.In the meantime, I will be vigilant about the food I order by educating myself about the foods and phraseology . This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Cantonese food,positive,40,02/26/15,Food is good but service is spotty during Chinese New Year period. We have no issues with the food nor the pace of food being served but the staff are simply too overwhelmed to be able to remember other requests.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Slow service, salty food",negative,20,31-Oct-16,"Orders are placed via a tablet and we ended up waiting for 15min to be served. Only the sashimi was served quickly, everything else took really long to prepare and we spent more time waiting for our food than eating. The kitchen also forgot many of our orders. Sashimi was ice-cold in the middle and the grilled dishes were too salty. Would not come back again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Recommended,positive,50,20-Mar-17,"Made reservation through Chope for 5 pax & was promptly ushered in. Food quality was good, service was promp.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top Japanese Food in the Raffles Hotel,positive,50,1-Nov-14,"We enjoyed excellent and refined Japanese cuisine before we flew back to Europe. The menu options are all expensive but well worth the price. The Chef is a master in Japanese cuisine and prepares the food in front of you, asking you about any preferences you may have. The ingredients are fresh and of absolutely top quality. The whole experience is a delight."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointing & outrageous,negative,20,8-Mar-11,"We went in there expecting good food. The attention the staff gave us was outstanding but it was too much attention. Waiting was long. The food preparation was fun to watch . We had maine lobster tasted like rubber, the kobe beef from Australia got over cooked and well done. When we finished the dinner and when we saw the outrageous amount of sgd of 2000/- we almost choked. Felt like the kobe beef was stuck in our throats. Over priced, over cooked over attentive. What a disappointment !!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,OVER-RATED: Soon to be Dead-Duck!,negative,30,06/20/15,"Mediocre.There is NOTHING to rave about this restaurant.Their roast duck is slightly above average standards but way to fatty and oily in my personal opinion. Also, though the meat was pretty tender, it didn't have much taste to it - like the marinate hadn't settled into the meat.The rest of the dim sum and food were extremely average, nothing you cannot find in Singapore.This is a try once sort of restaurant that does not have any offerings that would attract you back the second time."
French,L_Angelus,Terrible service,negative,10,28-Jan-12,The food is pretty good but not for the price. The service is awful!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE perfect japanese restaurant outside japan,positive,50,10-Dec-16,"outstanding and authentic japanese food of the very highest quality! pricy yes, but its worth every penny!! seeing the chefs preparing your sashimi and sushi dishes is a delight, again, outstanding!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese restaurant,positive,40,7/6/2015,"Really nice chinese cousine. Very rich menu and fantastic sea food. One of the best crabs in Singapore that I tasted. Service also very fast and professional.
Place to go back."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for !,positive,50,1-May-15,We had read about this restaurant and were not disappointed worth the price if you like exquisite sashimi served by a master. The timing was perfect and the chef delighted with continual questions made this meal special. Also fish we don’t get in Australia. The Yuzu sorbet desert still lingers.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",outstanding,positive,50,30-Dec-16,"There is not a better Japanese restaurant in Singapore, this place is incredible in terms of food quality, service at the counter watching the chef's prepare and in terms of a lunch time price (apparently it's double in the evening so go for lunch!).Excellent in terms of impressing a client or a girl the delivery of one item at a time really enables you to fully enjoy the experience while still having great conversation. They have it sorted. Highly recommended."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",WOW,positive,50,3-Sep-12,4 of us were lucky enough to eat here on August 22. Amazing food / staff. We had KAZ as our chef. Great young man and very knowledgeable re the food etc. If l could afford to eat here once a month l would. One off experience.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Tetsuya - you never let us down! Waku Ghin is the BEST dining experience in Singapore...,positive,50,12-Oct-12,"We enjoyed our first Tetsuya experience in his Sydney restaurant for our anniversary in December. My partner surprising me for my birthday last week with a trip to Singapore and a booking at Tetsuya's latest venture - Waku Ghin. Waku Ghin is completely unique - I understand why there are so many varying reviews.Those seeking a sublime culinary dining ""experience"" will love it... those seeking anything else will walk away disappointed.Yes, it is expensive... but the quality service and food surpasses anything you will find in a swanky French restaurant. It's simple really - if you're not willing to pay, don't make the booking!Waku Ghin offers a set degustation menu, with 3 couples (6 guests) seated around a teppanyaki bar, interacting with their own personal chef throughout the evening. It is a rare occasion for a chef to show you the food he is preparing and cooking for you, let alone telling you the secrets of how he is doing it!I find the reports of food poisoning hard to believe. The food is fresh... so fresh in some occasions it is still alive when presented to the chef in front of you. Seafood and meat from Australia is flown in every 2 - 3 days.Highlights of our meal included the signature dish - sea urchin and caviar - which was a complete taste sensation, and the Cape Grim beef - we have never, and probably will never again, enjoy steak as tender and tasty as that piece of meat.THANK YOU Tetsuya for another very special evening... you're doing Australia proud!"
French,Saveur,Simple goodness,positive,40,24-Feb-18,Their signature duck confit and creme brulee dessert were just right. Simple decor and location made for a nice ambience for an afternoon with friends :)
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but not great",positive,40,01/14/14,"Solid Dim Sum place in Singapore. Not the best dim sum I've ever eaten in my life, quite good nevertheless. If you're a fan, you'd probably like it."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Not very clean reaturant,negative,30,25-Oct-17,"We went there but didn't find the place to be clean, they had too less staff (may be on that day) as no body came to take orders for almost five minutes, ultimately we left without having anything and surprisingly nobody even bothered to ask...More"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must have,positive,50,1/4/2017,Was taken to this restaurant by a fellow colleague. The food was amazing everything served was cooked perfectly everyone 7 out 7 did not have a dish they did not like. There crab is one of the best dishes to recommend. Will return to this restaurant again next time I come to singapore. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An average dining experience,negative,30,15-Jan-17,"Booked the restaurant from the stellar reviews found online. Thought the food was alright. The sashimi slices were particularly thick but not great. We order a variety of sashimi but felt too full to continued with much of the other cooked dishes. For the same price, I think there are better Japanese buffet restaurants. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration,positive,50,12/28/16,This was our 1st visit to Peach Blossoms and our experience matched many of reviews we read before make our reservation. Excellent staff/service and the menu/food was fantastic. All added to by the very kind thoughts and effort that went into the very personalised thoughts/birthday message & desert.A return to Peach Blossoms will certainly be on our must do list when we next return to Singapore

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Hands-down the best uni dish ever,positive,40,27-Dec-17,"Waku Ghin is located within the Marina Bay Sands complex, a massive structure comprised of a hotel, casino, high-end shopping and celebrity chef restaurants. Waku Ghin is the child of Japanese-Australian Chef Testuya Wakuda, whose Sydney-based restaurant has been one of our favourites. Conceptually, Waku Ghin is a semi private dining experience where food is served counter style in several small rooms, ranging in capacity from four to eight diners. There is a fixed price ten course menu that features luxurious seasonal ingredients. The final two courses are served in a larger dining lounge where one can overlook the 8 pm light show that takes place at the adjacent lagoon. This also allows the restaurant more flexibility for their second dinner seating. Now to the food: In generally, the dining experience did not disappoint. The meal started out with tuna belly sashimi, followed by Waku Ghin’s signature dish – uni served in a sea urchin shell with Botan shrimp sashimi and caviar. Heaven in a sea urchin exoskeleton! The third course was also a highlight – perfectly cooked filet of Tachiuo with foie gras and Okinawa spinach served in dashi – a deadly combination. The next three courses were a little bit less successful: the seared Hokkaido scallop was a little on the tough side, albeit tasty, the char grilled spayed open Carabinero shrimp was on the dry side, and the poached lobster could have been more tender (the claw was delicious, but the tail was somewhat chewy). This was made up for by a stunning Wagyu beef dish that melted on the palate, followed by a rice bowl with grilled Wagyu which was quite delicious also. Dessert consisted primarily of a chocolate mousse cake – it tasted good, but came across as short on creativity. Service was impeccable, and the wine list was large and ranged from reasonably priced wines to a 58,000 $ bottle of something that I can’t remember and would never order, even if I had the cash.Altogether, we had a lovely evening at Waku Ghin. I would rate the food somewhere between four or five stars, but given the price of the meal at close to 500 $ Can per person, one should reasonably be able to expect perfection – and perfect it was not."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Lively place,positive,40,3/11/2014,"Big crab, if seafood is your thing, then this place is somewhere to visit. The live crabs and fish are really interesting and entertainment for the kids. Very busy, Book in Advance!"
French,Poulet,"poor food, worse service",negative,20,30-Oct-13,"This is actually about the Great World City branch to which I went with my wife before seeing a movie in same shopping mall. We chose to share a whole roast chicken - their signature dish, which they call poulet roti. It certainly wasn't worth anything near the S$38++ they charge. While the cooking was acceptable, although possibly slightly underdone, the chicken itself was of battery-hen quality, and tasteless. We asked for what they described as a baguette to go with it - but it turned out not to be a loaf of French bread but instead just four thin slices of toast, each no more than a few square centimetres. The drinks were similarly expensive - and even glasses of warm water were priced at 50 cents each. But the poor quality of the food and the inflated prices are not the main complaint. The service was outright nasty. We were treated in an offhand manner from the start, the waitress making no explanation of what was on offer. When the food arrived we asked for extra napkins, so she brought us a plate. We asked for mustard; but she had evidently never heard of such stuff, although she managed to bring some after going off to ask for advice from colleagues. Then - oops! - I upset a glass of Coca-cola, drenching the table and seats and soaking my trousers. There was no one around to help, so I stood and up shouted out; when nothing happened I shouted louder - ""someone, anyone, bring a cloth!"" The waitress was standing at a nearby table, chatting. I shouted louder, my wife stood up and shouted, and customers at other tables stared at us. The kitchen staff stopped work and stared at us, but the waitress stayed in her position, still chatting. Eventually, after what seemed like an age, but was probably less than a minute, the manager came over, helped clean up and took us to a fresh table. He didn't seem surprised when I said I wasn't going to pay the 10 per cent service charge."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent ,positive,40,25-Jan-15,Highly recommended for chats. But the main course was a mixed bag . Sabzee was not Upto the mark . Briyani was tasty . Worth a visit for chats
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A huge grouping of local eateries,negative,30,28-Jun-16,"You can get many things to eat of a Malay-Chinese nature. Just go around and choose what you want, they'll bring it to your table. The quality is not the best but it is authentic and colourful."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unhappiness,negative,20,24-Oct-16,"My order list was misplaced, have to wait for 45 min to realise my order form is lost. Feel very disappointed for the service. I feel the service is poor not worth to pay the service charge."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi,positive,50,5-Sep-15,Sashimi was very fresh and thickly sliced! Hot/cold green tea available free flow at only $1. Nice ambience.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Mix,negative,30,30-Jul-12,"If you are just visiting for a short time, and you want one place that has all the signature Singapore dishes, this is it. You do get hassled by Spruikers pushing their stalls, best to ignire them."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Always a favourite,negative,30,31-Oct-16,Nice spacious outlet located on Dempsey's road. It gets really crowded on weekends and special occasions. Majority visited by foreigners (non-Indians). The quality of food here is good and they try to maintain it throughout. Attentive staff. Quiet ambience. Definitely worth a try!

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),elegant,positive,50,7/7/2012,we had yum cha on our last day and wished we had of had an evening meal; pricey but worth a treat to yourselves; stick to chinese tea and it keeps the costs down!
French,L_Angelus,Authentic experience of a French Bistro,positive,40,8-Mar-15,"OK, so the staff may be a little formal, but they all speak French and a healthy number of their patrons were French speaking when my wife and I visited. So, give your French a try! Atmosphere was very authentic, but a bit more swish than a typical Parisian bistro and far more room. We had a bit of a hiccup with my wife's entree, when 45 minutes after ordering we were told that it was off the menu. However, the remainder of the meal went very smoothly and they did the right thing (my wife's replacement entree turned out to be complimentary). I had the warm goats cheese for entree, whilst my wife had a pate: both really excellent. My main meal was duck with figs: outstanding. My wife had entrecôte steak: cooked 'a point' as ordered, but quality of beef a little lacking. Superb wine list, with prices upwards of $88 (plus the irritating""++""). Definitely worth another visit."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Something different,positive,50,8-Jan-13,"This restaurant is something for a very special occasion. It is very expensive but the tasting menu (you cannot order anything else) is excellent. The dishes are prepared in front of you and the ingredients are shown beforehand. From abalone, via sea urchin, soups, lobster and steak - there is something for everybody. Also special requests are catered today without any issues. The dessert is then presented in a special room from where you have a view on the marina. I really enjoyed the experience but the prices are a all the way up there."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Enjoyable lohei dinner at Peach Blossoms,positive,40,02/15/18,"Visited with extended family members and ordered a substantial feast comprising yusheng, a giant steamed marble goby, roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork with lychees, braised tofu in crab sauce, vegetarian sharksfin and glutinous rice steamed in lotus leaves. Dessert was yuzu cheesecake from the coffee shop on Level 4. Everyone enjoyed the meal. There was so much food we had to take away some of the rice and the dessert. The yusheng was a Marina Mandarin specialty, comprising fruit and salmon - really worth paying a premium for. We used a dining voucher which shaved about $300 off the total bill. Final bill was about $600 - a steal, given the food was of good quality and was for 11 pax."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not to be missed in Chinatown,positive,40,10/17/14,"People say that this is arguably the best dimsum in Singapore. Nice tradtional shophouse atmosphere, fresh dumplings, easily accessible by train, and in the heart of Chinatown. Great value for money as part of the Singapore experience."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Tetsuya Masterpiece with wonderful staff,positive,50,3-Aug-12,"A great restaurant that is pricey but is a dining experience with wonderful friendly respectful and knowledgeable staff. We had a great meal that will be remembered for quite some time, but even better was the conversations with the sommelier and the restaurant manager. Thank you for a great evening.Our only negative is that we were told to gain access to the restaurant through the casino. This was a big mistake as you are constantly having your passport checked and the passport is a smokey smelly noisy place that is not of the quality of the restaurant"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Not the best we have had for the price,negative,30,19-Mar-13,"This Indian restajurant is not the best we have had in Singapore. We went to the one on Dempsey Hill. The food was ok, but did lack in flavor would not go there again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great time, but be prepared to fork out $$$",positive,50,3-Oct-18,"Great time to celebrate with my partner. We booked 1 month in advance, and need to secure the booking with a credit card guarantee.We had the degustation menu of 10 courses, and a bottle of sake. No complaint of the food, all dishes were memorable, especially the uni dish and wagyu beef.The restaurant had 2 seating timing, and we were informed that second timing was full on that day - but the restaurant kept the number of diner to a minimum of 10-12 pax per seating."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not at all impressed.,negative,20,10/9/2014,"I never like giving negative reviews but I think it is important for those thinking of having a meal at this place to save their money and time especially as there are so many better and cheaper restaurants to pick from. The food was just there, the service was poor and focused mostly on getting us fed and out in the shortest time. I really advise thinking twice about going to the Long Beach. We got a definite feeling because we weren't locals we weren't really welcomed. As for the chili crab, you will do much better for far cheaper at just about any Hawker stand."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dad's Birthday,positive,50,03/24/17,Webt back to celebrate my dad's birthday. As usual my family came here because of the excellent service Terry gave to us. Dad was extremely happy with the food and the special cake arrangements. Thank you Terry for giving us a wonderful dining experience!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must on a Singapore visit,positive,40,01/19/14,"A friend introduced me to Long Beach and I recently visited with colleagues. I'd been building it up all day and the food and staff didn't disappoint.We started with the geoduck clam sashimi and soup bowl, followed by mango chili grouper (which would be my last meal on earth), chilli crab & black pepper crab. All were out of this world. Only downside was the noodle dish which was a little gluey. Staff were very attentive and friendly without being pushy.That being said, it was pricey and we'd probably be a bit more reserved on the next visit."
French,Angelina_MBS,good food and desserts,positive,40,30-Aug-16,"very good french food - flavourful, perfectly cooked. praises all around from our table. desserts were also exceptional.just wish staff were a bit more flexible. wanted to change hot chocolate from promo to the iced version because it was a hot day and they were of same value but was firmly told no because POS system only registers hot for the promo. at least was given a cup of ice but only after much persuasion."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Little Piece of Paris in Singapore,positive,40,5-Nov-12,"L'Entrecote Singapore provides an almost-perfect version of Parisian entrecote - right down to the great vibe, crowded seating, single choice of main course (and house Burgundy), free-flowing fries - and excellent entrecote and sauce. The coffee is good, the deserts excellent. The only thing lacking is visible, strong management. The staff are mostly efficient, but not perfect. A bit of training - and a personable, highly-visible, hands-on, experienced manager with a Parisian accent would turn this place from four stars into five.Note: If you've not tried entrecote before, don't go here expecting a range of main courses. The steak is why you go here. If you want a greater range, there are other places that do this - if you want steak frites with a great sauce, and only that, come here."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",great food,positive,40,17-Dec-15,great food and good for big groups dining. will be dining in shin minori again. recommended to go on weekends.
French,Saveur,Worth going back,positive,50,16-Mar-17,"Food was good as usual, foie gras, duck confit, the salted caramel lava cake, all worth eating again. Ordered the 3-course set dinner, definitely worth the money.just that it was abit squeezy as they tried to put us in between 2 noisy tables. not sure why they dont like to open up their other space at the basement, but squeeze everyone at the top entrance level."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not bad,negative,30,10/21/17,"Came here on our last night in Singapore. We wanted to try their black pepper crab. They have a few set banquet which of course all feature either black pepper or chili crab. We've picked one with razor clams (was excellent) and lala rice noodle (I've read that's good). There were quite a few tables around us but somehow everyone's food came before we did.The waitress did warn us that the normal crabs they had at the time were a bit small so was expected that. However, we were a bit disappointed with the black pepper crab. Didn't find the taste that great.We then ordered another type of crab (Scottish wild crab) and cooked it with chili, this dish was excellent. The crab was sweet and the chili sauce was very fragrant. Perfect to dish the fried buns in.The meal was not cheap but at least we had a few good dishes."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious food with plenty of choices,positive,50,14-Feb-17,I have dined at Kailash Parbat on several occasions. They have plenty of choices and food is just delicious. I like all kind of dishes and naan(bread) choices here. My wife enjoys the CHAATs. I wouldn't hesitate this restaurant to anyonewho wants to enjoy a proper Indian vegetarian meal. Expensive compared to other traditional vegetarian restaurants.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting Dining Experience from the mind of Tetsuya,positive,40,19-Oct-15,"We booked for our anniversary (6 weeks beforehand) because we had heard about this restaurant. Even though it doesn't quite rank on the World scale, it still is on every Foodie's list to visit. The communal-style dining booths are a bit hard to get used to particularly if you have annoyingly loud strangers as your dining companions (which we did). You sit up at a Teppan plate with your own chef who cooks for you. This is terrific and if you have a friendly chef, it makes for an great dinner conversation (which it was). We supped on a plethora of fresh seafood including sea urchin, Tasmanian abalone (we flew thousands of kms to eat Aussie local!) and scampi and finished with Wagyu. You are then transferred to a quieter dining room to finish your desserts. It was an experience that whilst very expensive, and not quite the romantic anniversary dinner we were hoping for, was definitely worth ticking off the list."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Famous Maybe Standards of Service and Chaat wose than a Dhaba,negative,30,18-Apr-16,"Our second time, in as many years. Didn't feel welcome at all as we walked in.

French,L_Angelus,Excellent...,positive,50,28-Dec-14,"Been many times but not for a few years and it did not disappoint. Walked in and it was very familiar surroundings and I immediately felt relaxed and ready for some classic French fare. Started with foie gras simply prepared but with decadence. Next was a bavette steak full of flavour, topped with shallots and accompanied with very crispy straw fries, yumm. To finish the theatrical crepe suzzette done table side. Wine is typical singapore prices but the range and quality are always there in the L'Angelus group. A great meal, well prepared with great service. Worth a try. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",great experience,positive,50,1-Oct-16,"made booking thru chope for 4 people. they were very accommodating when 5 of us turned up.

quality of food (sushi, sashimi) was acceptable too.
will definitely go back again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Chope is AWESOME, Shin Midori used to be too...",negative,30,11-Sep-17,"Food was alright. Service got messy due to crowd. Many disruption for wifi digital food ordering too. Avoid going on Fridays especially if you want to be having a peaceful, comfortable and enjoyable get together. Loud noisy big groups made the place so rowdy and noisy that you can hardly even hear yourself. Popularity equates to such I guess. Quite turning off. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very tasty North Indian Vegetarian food,positive,50,29-Sep-17,One of the best place in singapore where you get good tasty Indian Vegetarian food. This place is must go place for the whole family every month and we love each and every time we go here. The food is amazing. The quality and quantity is perfect and no regrets in paying the bill as your stomach is well taken care each visit. Kudos. Keep up the good work. Only one request from my side the Pani puri lacks the authenticity. Please work on it.

It turned out that she organised drinks (from another nearby vendor) and our two meals, which happened to be from a third vendor. Excellent service and very cheap. So good for local street food that we went back a second night and wull most likely go back again before we leave."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money birthday promo,positive,40,18-Sep-17,There is ongoing birthday promotion which makes weekday lunch buffet value for money. No time limit.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Veg Food ,positive,40,2-May-15,"This is simply the best Indian vegetarian restaurant that you'll find in Singapore. Cost wise, it's $50-60 for 2 people on an average. The Dal Makhani is the best here. So is Aloo Tuk/ Arbi Tuk. Been here at least 20 times. Be assured of good food. The one opposite Mustafa is usually crowded on weekend evenings."
French,Angelina_MBS,OK,negative,30,19-Sep-17,Angelina's has changed. Has become less upmarket. Not sure if that's a good thing. But I guess it's still ok.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty - Good Concept,negative,30,12-Aug-15,Tasty lunch - very tight seating. Steak was tough though. IF you wish a great steak meal - try another place before L'entrecote.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi quality,positive,40,8-May-17,"The sashimi was fresh and tasted really good. Many selections of food which was great.
However, drinks were not included in the buffet (not even plain water) despite the buffet was almost $50/pax (after taxes)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable but not the best,negative,30,21-Apr-16,"Newton is a tourist food market in my opinion, the taxi drivers will try to take you there if asked where is a good place to go. There are plenty of stalls to choose from and don't worry about the stall owners hassling you just find a seat then walk around the stalls to see what you like, the routers will try to get you to sit in their stall location. The food is very good and a reasonable price but can get better else where cheaper. It is an experience to say the least. Take a taxi or the MRT is right there as well so easy to get to. Funny enough we have den there several times and stall 69 s eels to be a good place to site and eat but have a look your self before choosing.There are clean toilets on site which us a bonus"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Freshness of food with Amazing chutnies ,positive,50,18-Dec-14,"Being here several times, just love this place for its fresh south indian dishes & specially the different variant of chutneys they serve.
Will be back again n again
??????"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent palce for family lunch/dinner,positive,40,17-Apr-15,"They have turned down the heat of Indian Cuisine to serve the locals. Should improve their quality of Indian tandoors that they serve. Gravies are good, salads are awesome and the best is mango lassi."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Fantastic Frites, Fast Food Service Speed, Overall C+",negative,30,3-Mar-15,"Arrived on time for 7:30pm booking. We were acknowledged by the Maitre'd however he stated he would be back.A couple of mins later one of the waiting staff approached us to enquire if he could help. We stated we had a reservation for 7:30pm in the name given at the time of booking. He checked and confirmed our details and directed us to our table.Our waitress was pleasant, but seemed to be in a terrible rush.Having delivered menus were were asked shortly afterwards if we were ready to order. I know its a simple menu, but we had come out for a nice relaxing meal, not really what one has come to expect of Les Bouchon.We placed our order for main courses, we had already decided to skip the starters, and shortly afterwards the salads arrived along with cold bread rolls.This is something that both branches have continued to fail on for a good few years. Originally the rolls were served warm, now it appears one has to request them to be warmed once they have been delivered.Shortly afterwards the main courses arrived a. Both steaks were cooked as ordered, medium rare, and medium. I must compliment this branch on their frites - They are out of this world!!!! A lot better than the Ang Siang Hill branch where the fries always seem to have been cooked and are reheated under a grill which results in rock hard frites.From start to finish, including settling the bill, 57 mins!!'Finally someone has come up with a Fast Food version of Steak & Frites!!!!!!!!Overall, not the type of evening my wife and I were expecting.The frites were Tres Bon, but I doubt very much we will not be returning to this branch.Service - 7/10Service Speed - 11/10Frites 10/10 Ang Siang Hill Frites (4/10)"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Excellent food,positive,40,18-Dec-11,A small joint but serves the best idlis and dosa. Recommend for any tourist
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection,positive,50,11-Feb-17,I should say it has quite a good selection of food for us to choose from. Sashimi was fresh which is important! Yakirori was a plus point

Neat and clean place.Only if you have patience to wait as it has good patronage.I would definitely recommend this place.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Lunch Buffet - Farrer Park,negative,20,6-Oct-17,"Basic food, catering to tour groups, which means the place is crowded, the queue is always long and the food is always gone.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Again and again... And again.. The best restaurant in the world...,positive,50,7-Dec-14,"After probably over 10 diners at Waku Ghin the last 3 years, it is each time the best gastronomic experience in the world...again and again and again..."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great experience,positive,50,31-Oct-15,Food took a while to come even though we were one of the earliest there. Other than that it was a lovely evening. Food tasted great and the service was just nice.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sea food,positive,40,07/29/16,"I highly recommend the chili and peper crab. Good service and nice atmosphere. Although located in the center of Singapore, you are around nature."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Better than Tetsuya in Sydney,positive,50,11-Dec-12,"Having dined at Tetsuya’s in Sydney, my husband and I had high expectations for Waku Ghin.Waku Ghin offers an exquisite 10-course degustation menu created from some of the best seasonal produce imported from Japan and Australia. We absolutely loved the Japanese and European flavours and were completely blown away by the food. To some extent, we actually prefer Waku Ghin over Tetsuya's. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some very good recommendations from their extensive wine list.Guests are seated in front of a teppanyaki bar and the food is prepared right in front of your eyes by the chef. Our favourite dish was none other than the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar which was just sensational. The ocean trout, pigeon and the wagyu beef were also superb. We're rather surprised to read the negative reviews. In our opinion, Waku Ghin is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore and the world even. Sure it's expensive but the dining experience including the food, presentation and service is unparalleled. Our only complaint is that the restaurant decor lacks imagination but then again, you're there for the food not the furniture."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday celebration ,positive,50,11/15/16,"Today is my wife birthday so we decided to celebrate at Peach Blossoms Chinese restaurant with my family. The food here is good and the service we received is awesome. The staff is very friendly. I got to know a few of them is Terry, Jeff, Mun Fang and Christine. Especially i need to mention is Christine, she gave my wife a unforgettable birthday experience by singing birthday song with us and prepare the cake on a plate with blessing wording on it. I will highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good vegetarian restaurant,positive,40,10-Jan-14,"this place is quite a good option. The taste was quite good, nice clean place and prices were also reasonable.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very cramp restaurant,negative,10,13-Nov-17,My friend was made to squeeze in between tables with absolutely no assistance from the service staff. Horrible experience.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty,positive,40,19-Mar-17,"We went there early thus the service very attentive. Nice touch that they gave complimentary rosè wine. Ordered the steak with fries. Their steak sauce was a touch acidic (sour), too sour for my liking. The French fries was cooked well, well seasoned and crispy."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice good and service,positive,40,8-May-17,It was crowded for a weekday lunch. I like that the food comes piping hot and the sashimi was fresh. And they serve swordfish sashimi too which many places do not serve for buffet. Dessert cake was a disappointment though as it was served frozen.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good food & Good service,positive,40,08/13/15,I went to this restaurant with high hopes that the duck would resemble those I've eaten in London and it did not fail me. The duck was obviously not from our part of the world as the layer of fats was exceptionally thicker than normal. The price for a portion for 1-2 persons at $12.80 was reasonable especially if you are eating other dishes. The Shrimp dumpling soup was normalThe crispy London duck snow bun was commendable tho a tad sweet. Egg tarts were actually very good. Very Flaky pastry with excellent smooth egg filling.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good food,positive,50,3-Sep-14,"I went to Muthu`s Curry in Little India (not in Dempsey, but it`s the same chain). I had Butter Chicken, and it`s the best butter chicken I ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant, and I`m definitly going to try the one in Dempsey Hill."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab,positive,40,03/24/18,"Come here everytime for its black pepper crab. I notice most other ppl ordered the chili crab, but for me black pepper is preferable. Place is always crowded, even on monday night. Reservation is a must if u want to sit indoors. Not a suitable place for dates imho"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese food outside of Japann ,positive,50,12-Nov-14,I dined at their restaurant at St Regis rather than Raffles . The food was better than anything I have had outside Japan or at Kuruma Sushi in NYC . Had middle priced omakase menu - very expensive but worth it . Saves you airfare to Tokyo . Outstanding food .

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A favourite now a disappointment,negative,30,11-Apr-15,"This is our 10th visit to Singapore and about our 8th to Newton. First time was when the stalls were makeshift with dirt floors. All modernised and clean now. We always go to #36 Michael, the stall owner with dyed hair, a different colour each time we visit. Usually he serves our choices (mine always Chilli crab) just perfectly. Not so this time. My crab was quite black, eggs and dead mens fingers still present in sauce. Meat too well cooked, so tough and legs dry. Sauce was just mushy. Everything now served on polystyrene plates, food goes cold quickly. First time ever I've left a lot uneaten. We ordered satay sticks first and they came after husbands main course, which was fried calamari. Looked a good portion on plate, but found much of it was deep fried onion rings.Can't help but think standard may be slipping as resting on good reputation of the past. Will have to think twice about returning on future visits to Singapore, especially when so many other centres are popping up with good food and good value."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Definitely the best Dim Sum in Singapore,positive,40,11/2/2013,"Loved the variety of dim sum available. The menu is in Chinese so did not really know what to order. But they bring the dim sum in a trolley and you can pick whatever looks good. It did match the great dim sum I had in Shenzhen (China) some time back. Very authentic. It is not really a fancy restaurant, but gives you a feel of how food is enjoyed in China."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Free Birthday treat redemption,negative,30,29-Nov-17,"There’s no free lunch, any Free treat comes with a Min condition- 1 adult Ala Carte buffet lunch excl drink.For ala Carte lunch of $40++ (Tax incl) per pax rate in near town, UE Square, consider ex but value for 2 though with limited public accessibility.We paid for 2 pax with drinks total spent $105+/- for a family of 3 buffet lunch on birthday. So it’s not Free in our context.As the voucher is for all year redemption, so it’s subjective to individual Budget.AC Buffet offers wide spreads, recommended sashimi, chawanmushi, handrolls & teppanyaki/bbq items.Tried most of the recommended on menu, some good some average."
French,Paul,Overpriced ,negative,20,10-Feb-17,Looking for a coffee and sat here. I was prepared to pay $6 for a coffee and while we were there saw lovely smoked salmon baguettes for $7 so ordered two. When we received the bill those same baguettes were charged at $15 each plus 10%service plus GST. We questioned the cost and we were told that the prices in the window were for take away with eat in costing double. It would have been nice to know!Overrated food and coffee. Not recommended.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore chilli crab,positive,40,19-Oct-13,"Looking for a traditional Singapore dish on our last night in Singapore we took a taxi to Newton food market. The place was packed full of locals and tourists. We were soon shown to a table by one of the over eager stall owners touting for business. We ordered Singapore chilli crab and Hainanese Chicken and was not disappointed. The crab was fresh hot and spicy with the contrast of chicken mild and moist We had a selection of noodles, rice ,vegetables and Tiger beer total bill came to 60 Singapore dollars. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Singapore and enjoyed the atmosphere and found the locals in Singapore very friendly and polite.

Price is reasonable and service was attentive."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Succulent duck,positive,40,8/4/2015,"Went there on a weekday for lunch. There was a long Q but well controlled. Suppose it is a novelty for Singaporeans. The wait was worth it . The duck is tasty, succulent and the noodles have a nice crunch. We also had the ""char siew"" which is more local than ""London"" . It tasted sweet and goes well with rice"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service :Practice Racism,negative,20,6/8/2013,"Avoid this place if u are Asian .... They don't serve Asian well...we were there sitting at one of tr corner for 10 mins with no one serving us, they kept telling us that dim sum trolleys will come and serve us, but the 2 tables with Caucasians next to us were able to order and they serve the dim sum to their table, well I thought we can do the same but they kept asking us to wait, wait and wait. We asked another waitress if we can order the food instead of waiting the trolley since it took ages for the trolley to serve to the corner we sat, but the other waitress told us to wait too ..... Seem likes this is their management direction n we decided to bring our money somewhere else ..."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent food,positive,50,27-Jan-17,"Went for dinner and had pani poori, bhel poori chaat items. Also naans and paneer butter masala, very tasty and fast efficient service. Slightly on the expensive side but worth a visit"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Never returning,negative,10,16-Feb-17,"Horrible waiting time, food not served despite countless request, cold foods, poor quality of food although many choices. Price doesn't match quality of food expected"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Weekday dinner,negative,30,17-Sep-16,"Fried items were excellent: crispy, flavorful, juicy, and without a hint oily taste. However, the grilled items were quite disappointing: they were too dry and rather tasteless. Sashimi and maki were rather average. Nevertheless, the service staff was fast, efficient and very courteous. It was surprisingly packed during a weeknight especially since it is not near to an MRT station. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab and Chili Prawns,positive,40,8/3/2013,"My husband travels to singapore frequently, so when I got the opportunity to join him he said we had to come to Long Beach Seafood on Dempsey Road for the black pepper crab. I really loved the area around the restaurant and the food was really amazing. The seafood is so fresh it's swimming in tanks before you order it. Was quite busy on a Thursday night, and reservations are highly recommended, although we found that the locals were given priority over everyone else regardless of reservation or not. When we were sat it was at a very odd table in the corner by the front door, and we waited over 45 min for someone to come over to take our food order. We flagged down the hostess, who was very apologetic, and she got someone to come over and take our order right away. Despite this, I think the locale and the food were well worth the wait."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still th same after al these years,positive,40,4-Oct-16,This has got to be one of the best places to visit to experience the broad range of foods groups and styles typical to Singapore and the Asian region. Open all night it is also a great place for supper after a few drinks with friends. They used to have the biggest chicken wings I had ever seen but not anymoreThis time it was oyster omelet and mutton soup on the way home. So much choice there is something for everybody
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Affordable and Good Service,positive,50,5-May-16,Affordable north indian buffet spread. Good scenario on the outside but not in the inside. Otherwise good service from the waitress.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great experience.,positive,40,28-Dec-16,"We were staying in the centre of Singapore and found it very easy to use the public transport and go further afield. We took the tube to Newton Circus, which was cheap and the trains ran regularly. The actual food market has outside seating for diners and the idea is you choose from the menus of any of the food venues. We got rice from one, drinks from another and the main meal from a third... It's a kind of mix and match and each venue gives you a bill for what you had from their menu. Overall, it was a cheap night out and we enjoyed the food."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",my favourite,positive,40,11-Jun-12,I always visit muthu when i am back on vacation. It still has the pleasant environment. The briyani is nice and the fish head is really nice. Nice place for non veg eaters.

This is a chain of restaurant across india and the quality and standards are maintained here as well. The food is very tasty and authentic indian food is available. For those who feel homesick this is the best option. Located in little India locality, truely feels like home. The prices are a bit high but its worth it"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Inconsistent ,positive,40,22-Aug-17,"The place is always busy, but well organise as its got nice ambiance, clean, safe, friendly mamas & uncles offering you some different cuisine, though a bit pricey, but the price pays all those above.

Just that this time we were a bit disappointed as we ordered few different dish, most of the dish arrived quickly, but the main dish for our children came way too late while the first dish all were almost finish for us adult ... We had to get up twice reminding the stall to get food out. We ll go to another stalls next time ..."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Functional food stop,positive,40,3-Sep-17,"Counter order approach to service with fast turn around of orders.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Fries Bistro,positive,40,22-May-13,"You get what the name says - steak and fries and it's a bistro not a 5 star restaurant. So, if you are looking for something simple yet tasty, this place is worth your time and money. I've been here twice with my husband and would definitely come back whenever we feel like 'steak and fries' The serving size is good and the sauce they put on the steak is very yummy. If you finish your fries, they'll stock it up again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Let us finish the starter before serving the main course !,negative,20,1-Jun-14,"Having frequented the Relais de Venise in Paris, I was excited to try L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill in Singapore. Despite having to queue at any time of the night and any day of the week, the Parisian restaurant never failed to deliver in terms of food, service, ambiance and overall experience. Clearly I was expecting too much from the establishment in Duxton Hill.The online menu boasts 'an unlimited supply of crisp, golden French fries complimented by our hand selected L’Entrecôte red wine'. Perfect. I ordered the Entrecôte steak with its legendary sauce, golden French fries and walnut salad, and a carafe of the L’Entrecôte house red wine. The waitress apologised that they had run out of the house wine and invited me to make another selection. Surprised, I asked her to please check and she returned 5 minutes later with a carafe of what I assume was the house wine.The walnut salad arrived but was very uninspiring. Nevertheless I was half way through eating it when the waitress arrived with my steak. Without saying a word she picked up my salad as I was eating and moved it the other side of the table and plonked the steak down in front of me, and then swiftly left. 'But, but,...'. The steak was good, the sauce was good. It was only 10 minutes after I had finished my meal that the waitress asked if I wanted more fries. I informed her that I had already finished my meal 10 minutes ago. She walked off.Later she returned and asked if I had finished with my salad. I informed her that I was still eating it when she brought the main course. She walked off.Meanwhile, a young couple had arrived and were enjoying their walnut salad at the table opposite me. They were newly dating and engrossed in each other's company, only picking at their meal between animated conversations. Keen to learn whether my experience was an unfortunate one-off or common practice for this restaurant, I stayed to observe.Sure enough, before they had finished their salad the main course arrived and their salad plates relocated. I noticed a mild look of astonishment on their faces, but they were in love and nothing was going to spoil that.By this time the restaurant was half full, and rather sterile with no ambiance whatsoever, and certainly with no need to rush the customers through. I declined the desert on principle and promptly left with no intention of returning."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Makan time!!!,positive,50,18-Jan-17,"Oh my oh my ! its been almost a decade since I gone to Newton Hawker Center. Now its new , clean and spacious.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Impressive restaurant,positive,50,20-Mar-15,"This Indian restaurant serves very good and authentic Indian food. The quality of the food is very good and the taste is amazing.
The ambiance of the restaurant is also very good and is located well within the city."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is good.,positive,50,12/22/16,My table ordered half a duck. It was quite sizable. The roast duck is good. The gravy they pour on it the duck plus the plum sauce were delicious. I like duck and this ranks quite high up on my roast duck list. It is a bit on the fat side. The fat is very adherent to the meat and less so to the skin.The liver porridge was so-so. The pork cheong fun was good.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Better than some reviewers would have us believe,positive,40,9-Feb-12,"The key to enjoying this restaurant is to understand what they do well and what they don't. Food-wise, this is a great place to go for steak frites, which they do exceptionally well. My friend and I both had a nice big ribeye steak with a pile of frites and some creamed spinach. The location is great, almost like the ""Rive Gauche"" it takes after in Paris. Most people sit on the terrace outdoors, overlooking the Singapore ""river"" on Robertson Quay. There is an indoor section, if you feel the need for aircon. The wine list is also ok, with one or two nice bordeaux, but we also had a burgundy, which was not so good. That was the good news. The bad news is that the menu is very limited, so if you don't want a steak frites, then you are going to struggle. They could also do with a couple more side dishes. At the moment, there is a choice of creamed spinach, or er... creamed spinach. Some sugar peas or carrots would not go amiss. Service was ok, although could have been a bit more attentive.So, if you want a great steak frites (steak and chips) with a bottle of wine in a picturesque setting, then this is the spot. But if you want more of the general french restaurant experience, then go somewhere else."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",nice food,positive,40,12-Nov-17,food was nice. serving was fast. just the place is too cramp. table to table too close. can't talk freely. no privacy. just eat.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",The worst,negative,10,6-Aug-14,"The worst restaurant I have eaten at in Singapore.
The food was late, the beer was warm, the service was awful.
Cannot make a positive recommendation."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Best starter,positive,50,8/9/2013,"This restaurant has such great Chinese vegetarian dishes, but what really caught my attention was the free appetizer pickles given as a complimentary starter, I think the best pickled vegetable dishI have ever tasted. I asked for three bowls of it, and was graciously granted willingly with a smile. I would have been happy with that and rice, but am glad I had three other vegetarian dishes which were delicious. Nice ambience. Great service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointed,negative,20,30-May-16,"Went there for the first time and came out with disappointment. Was told that their online food order system is down. Given a piece of paper to write down our orders but the number of pens that are provided are limited. Eventually the customers next to our table lent us their pen. Waited for half an hour for the 1st dish to be served. The food are served very slowly. Almost waited for another half an hour for the 2nd dish to be served. The orders that we have made didn't turn up eventually and the dishes that we didn't ordered was served. Waitresses and waiters were dashing here and there panicky. Service can be better if the waiters and waitresses can be more polite when taking orders and acknowledge the customers' requests. Eg: I wanted to refill the hot green tea, the waitress came, listened to me and walked away without saying anything or nodding the head. Waitresses did bump into when they walked pass and they didn't apologized. When they are asked about the dish they are serving, the answers i got all the time is ""I don't know"" or ""I have no idea"". Food is so so. I'm pretty sure I can pay the same amount of money and get a better food and service in other japanese buffet restaurant."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Decent Steak!,negative,30,17-Sep-18,"The steak was well cooked but lady boss could be bit rude. We ordered a few mains to share, with a massive number of sides but she refused our request to top up for more fries as we were sharing mains *4 mains for 5 pax*. I'm sure the cost of our sides and desserts way exceeds the cost of another main. Don't blame her but it's just not very logical in our point of view."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A Higher State of Consciousness,positive,50,6-Aug-17,"The online thesaurus has 38 synonyms for Delicious, 44 for Remarkable ... I'm going to have try hard not to use them all in this review. This is 6 star dining in city spoilt with 5 star food.The menu is fixed, with seasonal updates occurring around an iconic heart of signature dishes.As an example, the Marinated prawn, sea urchin and caviar is nothing short of perfection. Sitting at the 8 seater teppanyaki counter those who had never tasted it sighed in surprise and delight, while those who'd enjoyed the pleasure before looked at their friends and cheered in delight, wistfully remembering the ecstasy of their own first time.Having been twice now, the impact of such a light but flavorful, richly salted, sweet and sour balanced dish isn't lost, even a note, the second time. I've not eaten a seafood dish as good in my life.This is a statement I must have made 5 or 6 times on my first visit no meter the dish - vegetables, rice and beef. A charming young sommelier guided us through the world of sake, and after a fascinating beginners introduction we settled on one of the houses own sakes, created in partnership with an artisanal brewer in Japan. This was delicious and much like a good wine with European cuisine, enhanced our meal even further.The dishes flow like ambrosia. One plate of perfection after the next. Strangers sitting along the counter all now firm friends, bonded through whimpers of pure pleasure.As dinner finished and we praised our chef, we were led to a lounge for desert. Delicate chocolates, a light aperitif, and a slice of the best melon I've ever had! I know this sounds ridiculous, but in a menu that consisted of the mind blowing and better, this humble melon deserves a mention. It just goes to show that a manic obsession with sourcing, respecting and preparing the very best can transcend food to heavenly places.Your going to pay handsomely for this euphoric meal, and it is worth every single penny. You'll leave feeling like something has changed in your life, something wonderful and for the better. "
French,Saveur,Saveur is good,positive,40,14-Feb-17,I love the duck confit and the salmon confit at saveur. The salted caramel lava cake is also delicious!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Terrible steak given its the only main meal,negative,20,10-Sep-13,My steak was tough as old leather. Really quite amazed this place can stay in business given this is the ONLY main. Entrée was great but wont be visiting again. Seating very crampe. d
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nothing fantastic ,negative,30,18-May-17,"I suppose it's attempting to follow a very autonomous serving idea, but we prefer a little more service. Walking into the restaurant, a server motioned us over to a table, we sat down and didn't get a single acknowledgment afterwards. All food and drinks were ordered on an iPad, and once prepared, dropped off without a word again. Food was decent, but not enough to make me want to go back."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Better than many other Indians,positive,40,21-Nov-16,"Tried here for Sunday lunch after years of going to Sammys and I think this is better although the atmosphere at Sammys is hard to beat.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab- gives you a reason to live!,positive,50,1/6/2013,"If Moliere is correctly quoted by Samy, the South Indian eatery nest door ( see reviews) he probably was thinking of the Black Pepper Crab at Long Beach. They claim to have invented the dish, but if that is a stretch they certainly did perfect it. This is one of Singapore's iconic dishes, deservedly so. I come here for crab and only Black PepperbCrab. No starters, no side dishes, just delectable crab washed down with a jug or two of Tiger.Come here, or to the original location at East Coast Parkway. You'll be thankful you did."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",stall 70 delight seafood - excellent food and great sell,positive,50,12-Oct-14,"Was advised to try this place via family friend was not disappointed. Overall the food stalls had a good variety and choice but a few of the hawkers were a bit in your face. After wandering around to get the overall flavour we stumbled on stall 70. Were met by Ms Tan Kwee Gek who charmed us with her sales pitch. After telling us the menu we said we would check out some more stalls but would likely be back. Needless to say we were. We had outstanding tiger prawns with chilli and garlic, fried rice, crispy baby squid and complementary Asian greens The food was great with a beautiful chilli zing, the prawns whilst not cheap were simply to die for. The sales pitch was very good but the food more than lived up to it and actually outshone it. Be sure to take your business card as the lovely lady collects them and is very pleased to show you recommendations from previous clients. If you try the Newton Hawkers centre check out stall 70 and i trust you enjoy as much as wedid."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Satisfactory standards for a Jap restaurant,positive,40,20-Jan-17,First visit to Shin Minori and was pleasantly surprised at the selection. Generous portioning of the sashimi slices which were fresh. Grilled dishes less impressive. Only negative is the noise from the renovations upstairs.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Excellent for south Indian snacks,positive,40,18-Dec-17,This is a typical south Indian restaurant providing meals as well as snacks which are both fresh and tasty.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",NOT AS IT WAS BUT STILL GOOD,positive,40,12-Feb-15,"The tourists discovered this place 45 years ago and its still a popular landmark in the Singapore dining scene. I always have the chilli crab from one of the stalls and the grilled prawns , some stir fried veg and I am set. I think the prices have gone from very cheap to really expensive comparatively and it is true you can now get the same thing at other hawker markets for much less . But this is the place to be ."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Frites,negative,20,11-Dec-14,"Went for an early dinner and it was fairly empty...so got a table easily. The restaurant filled up rapidly after that, so going early is best.Had an onion soup for starters and although the bread and gruyere topping was good, the soup easily was thin and on the salty side.Main course was of course steak and frites. My heart sank when I saw the steak drenched in the house ""secret"" sauce. A great steak is never dunked in sauce. I asked for the steak to be done medium rare, but it came close to medium. The steak beneath the sauce was stringy and had tendon. It was tender but lacked taste. And I couldn't make out the direction of the sauce.Dessert was their lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let's just say the highlight of the meal was the ice cream, not the cake and everything leading up to dessert.A very forgettable meal in the guise of a French bistro. The proprietor of this restaurant seriously needs to rethink the preparation of the food. But then it could just be me because the restaurant was full when I left."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very special place - don't miss it,positive,40,20-May-14,"We went there on my husbands business trip to Singapore - I went with him and we combined it with a holiday. One evening we had to go to dinner with his company, and they decided that I had to see this very typical Singapore place with all the different things to eat. We ordered a lot of different food and shared it. I recommend this place - and you'll find your favorite food in one of all the small shops."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli Crab,positive,50,16-Nov-15,We went during the day which we found out is not a popular time but we still had the chilli crab my husband was chasing. Cost was $40 and the taste was top notch! He also had sambal stingray for $12 which he loved aswell. I had pork and noddles which cost me $5 - make the effort.

French,L_Angelus,Sadly It's gone downhill since we were last here,negative,30,31-Mar-14,We used to enjoy coming here when we lived in Singapore and so wanted to introduce a friend. We were slightly disappointed with the service. Apparently they are trying to find more staff but it does spoil the meal slightly as the point of going to a restaurant is partly they you want to be served ! They had only one bottle of the champagne we ordered and also only one bottle of the red wine we chose. Dinner was steaks as this is what we remembered them doing well and they were good. As we had expected. Desserts on the other hand were a big disappointment. We ordered crapes Suzette and were optimistic when we saw they would be prepared at the table... The crepes themselves were already cooked. They were just put in the pan and sauce was added.... They were heavy and doughy not light and crispy and all the sauce did was to turn them into a soggy doughy mess. Had I been told that these were shop bought pre made pancakes I certainly would not be surprised.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Really Pleasant Lunch Experience!,positive,50,7-Jan-13,"I'm not gonna lie and say this is the best Indian food I have ever had and it's not the best I have had in Singapore, however it is a very good place to go if you want a quick Indian lunch.

French,Saveur,Spartan environment concept. Ok food.,negative,30,19-Dec-15,"First and foremost, keeping the name ""Saveur"" does invoke certain perception on the quality of location, environment, service and food.I have not been to Saveur, but being one who usually researches and looks at reviews prior, I have been forewarned to lower my expectations and not compare it to Saveur.We were meeting a long time friend there for lunch, and reaching just before they opened. Spartan greyish plain environment setting, creating a feel of 80s canteen style, though this results in the chairs making too much high pitch sounds when it is movedService to the table was ""spartan"" - maybe just waking up to the start of the day. Not much of a smile.Taking the set lunch, overall I would say the food is average to quite good, though it is dependent on what is ordered and your taste for the food - likely the reason for reviews that stretches from very good, satisfying, to bad, rubbish etc.With my lowered expectations, I would say overall is average, with definitely room for improvement, especially in terms of service, food quality, and presentation. Perhaps a 2nd visit will likely result in a more realistic review. At this point, I would just say it is somewhere you can go to if in need."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum,positive,50,08/16/12,Every time I'm in Singapore I go at least twice to this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Dim sum is fantastic (reasonable prices) and the lobster noodles are over the top (but expensive). My favorite is steam dim sum but I have to say that the deep fried mango and prawns rolls are great. I suggest to drink chinese tea with dim sum and here the chinese jasmine tea is excellent quality. At the weekends you don't have to order from the menu because you can choose directly from the trolley passing by the tables.
French,Paul,Good place for lesisurely for tea and pastries,positive,50,16-Dec-13,We used to go for tea at Kinokuniya Coffee Club. This is an excellent find very near the bookstore with good ambience. Get a window seating. Enjoyed the pastries and macarons
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,positive,50,07/19/18,"Yummy yummy yummy especially dimsum, all staffs and service was very good also. I like everything here."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hmm,positive,40,14-Aug-17,Good food but price has creep up a little since last visit. The buffet will be more appealing if free flow tea is included. Sashimi is fresh.
French,Saveur,Great service and great food,positive,40,8-Sep-16,"The staff who welcomed us did not make us feel very welcome. She had this grumpy look and started rattling what they have and not have before we could sit down. But after that, we had great service from the staff, including the one who welcomed us. I guess we arrived at the wrong moment. :) We enjoyed the food (the portion was just nice for ladies), one-for-one wine and the duck salad. The restaurant was nice and cozy. We will definitely go back again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum restaurant,positive,50,9/9/2015,"A friend of mine had recommended this restaurant as a good lunchtime venue and he was certainly correct. It is on a corner location and two stories up via escalator. Not too busy when we arrived about 12.30pm. Huge choice of dishes on menu. You just mark on the menu how many portions of each dish you require and the waiter then collects. All the dishes were freshly cooked and served without delay. Great value for money, for a change, in this rather expensive city."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Only acceptable for novice dim sum eaters,negative,20,09/26/14,"Don't waste your time and money here. Limited selection, poor flavour, very very average. The dim sum you can buy frozen and steam yourself is better than this.On the plus side the service is pretty good, waitress was very attentive and kept my tea topped up. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood Restaurant ,positive,50,06/28/16,There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore. Our family has visited the various shops of the various brands. Long beach at Dempsey Hill is top in our list. A bit further away from city centre but it is worth to spend the time on the travel
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Totally Recommend it! ,positive,50,9-Nov-17,Fish is super fresh and delicious!The staff is really nice and accesible. They will not give you what you ask them not to and they will substitute your pieces with something else instead of just not giving anything to you like other omakase places. The sake was one of the best I've ever had! Totally recommend this place! 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great fresh food,positive,40,11/10/2013,Don't really need to say anything else except ......don't miss eating here when in Singapore. The food is fantastic.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Perennial,positive,40,9/10/2015,"I first came here 10+ years ago when the place still had ceiling fans, now replaced by air conditioning, but no matter when or what, the food has maintained consistency. I have been several times now, but I have only just reviewed it.Dim sum dishes are plentiful. We also ordered a fish and on occasion I have watched my friends order chilli crab. The food service is very fast - he kitchen must be efficient.It is the sort of place that the locals go to, so give it a try. I am sure you will like the place."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Fabulous experience, delicious food",positive,50,22-Apr-14,"This is certainly an expensive dinner, so be prepared... but if you can afford to splurge, then don't hesitate! It is a different experience than what you might expect from most restaurants. You are seated at a bar with each course being prepared in front of you. The food speaks for itself - Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar, Tasmanian Abalone with Aonori, Braised Canadian Lobster with Couscous and Tajine Spice - are a few examples and are all delicious. The Wagyu Beef course was seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted. The staff is friendly and attentive. When it comes time for desert, you are moved to a table in a different room where you are able to enjoy a nice view as you complete your meal. Do it!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing experience,positive,50,6-May-16,"Excellent place to try authentic Japanese cuisine!
Chef Keisuke Fukasawa is outstanding - I would recommend to book the sushi corner to see the process and chat with the chef ??"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good spread of Chinese Dim Sum,negative,30,9/10/2015,"If you'd like a taste of Chinese Dim Sum, try out Yum Cha in Chinatown when you do visit there. You get a good spread of Dim Sum spread on push carts. The quality isn't the best, but it's a good sample spread taste test."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food BUT VERY Poor service ,negative,20,07/30/18,"Went for lunch and the food was good. We also requested to see their private room for an upcoming dinner event for 25 pax. When asked for the dinner menu, the senior staff actually told me to see the menu from the website. Are they going paperless?! No! When I request again from another waiter, he brought it to me within split seconds. Next, it was lunch peak hours when we were there, the waitress were busy folding the table cloth and not paying attention to us diners. When we requested to place order for our food, the waitress reacted as if I am interrupting her work of ""folding table cloth"". Thirdly, for a restaurant of this standard, we have to refill our own Chinese tea. Probably they are really short handed..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-money Japanese buffet,positive,40,10-Apr-17,"We had buffet at Shin Minori on April 8, to take advantage of the OCBC three-for-one promotion. It was very good, as usual, though we enjoyed our visit three weeks earlier more. That could be because we had not had sushi/sashimi for a long time. The sashimi was very fresh and we enjoyed the moriwase before we restricted ourselves to salmon and octopus. The salmon was well marbled, but we did not manage to get a morsel of the salmon belly on our second visit (maybe that was why we enjoyed our first visit more!!). Looking forward to our next visit, but after a time lapse, of course. Meanwhile, we cannot wait to eat Gayatri's (Race Course Road) yummy fish-head curry!!! I usually tarpow."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Be prepaid to pay but excellent food,positive,50,08/27/17,"The meal is bound to be expensive so it's not for those trying to preserve their wallets.

French,Angelina_MBS,Below average food that's overpriced,negative,30,11-Oct-17,"Had the vegetable risotto that came out cold - I don't know if it's because it took almost half an hour for the food to come, which in reason is itself indefensible. Portion was small for something that cost $32 after get and service charge but thankfully I wasn't too hungry then. It surprises me that the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu, having to take a look at the menu with every order we gave. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Execellent Restaurant ,positive,50,5/11/2017,"The restaurant give us a traditional environment for dining. The menu has large range of selections.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Cuisine.,positive,40,4-May-16,"Day 1 of our brief trip to Singapore concluded with dinner at this well known Hawker Centre in Newton Circus. A short taxi ride away from our Hotel.One is spoilt for choice at this venue with several hawkers all offering the same menu - be it seafood, or Malay Muslim cuisine, etc. Other hawkers only deal in fruit juices, soft drinks and beers.After a brief wander, we decided on Takara Grilled Seafood (Shop No. 74) run by Winnie.My wife and I shared the Black Pepper Singapore Crab, a baby Stingray and a portion of Seafood Noodles - ample quantities and really delicious. We had asked Winnie to hold the spice which was done.....The Hawker Centre was bustling and appears very popular with both residents and tourists. We returned to our hotel by Metro as Newton Station is a short walk away from the Hawker Centre."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dinner with colleagues - pepper/chili crab,positive,40,8/5/2017,Had an excellent dinner with four outside and of course enjoyed the pepper/chili crab as main dishes! Also ordered the bamboo scallops which also tasted excellent. And all with great Erdinger hefe weizen. A recommender!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Stuff yourself !! its Yumm,positive,50,21-Jun-16,We headed to KP before going on our shopping spree..and we loved every thing we ordered. Food tasted nothing less.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Elegant simplicity,positive,50,6-Apr-16,"Waku Ghin is a unique dining experience, well worth adding to your culinary destinations list. Seated in groups of 6 in front of a Teppanyaki-style arrangement, our food journey for each dish began as the chef cooked most dishes right in front of us with prepared produce and ingredients.While this final stage of cooking looked easy and effortless, don't be fooled! The real effort towards each dish is done out of eye and likely before you woke up that morning!Dishes are all deceptively simple and designed to hero a particular ingredient - mostly a seafood.We were impressed with every course. All were complex, elegant and simple. The wine list was extensive and we were guided by the somms with ease. We later toured the impressive wine cellar and chatted with he somms until we were the last patrons to leave.Brilliant 5-star dining."
French,Paul,Not Recommended,negative,20,30-Mar-18,"Was shopping at Takashimaya and stopped by for lunch. Despite being established in the 1800’s, this local branch didn’t have service not taste on top of list. Ordered the new on menu honey chicken over garlic rice, and vegetable quiche. Took about 30 min before food arrived. Checked was dry and had no honey taste. The quiche was ordinary. Many had to go up to the register to get their bill. Facility either had insufficient staff or management isn’t strong. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum,positive,40,06/19/15,This restaurant was a little hard to find. We passed the entrance and had to back track to find it. . . maybe it's just us. We were there before 11:00 and the place was packed. Really enjoyed the dim sum that they brought around with the carts. I can't speak Chinese but the ladies were nice enough to show me all the different dishes she was carrying. I like to eat my dim sum with some soy sauce but there isn't any on the table. Just ask the server and they will give you a small dish. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Needs a major overhaul,negative,20,25-Jan-16,"No service for 15 minutes, no bread basket, burnt steak, light fittings and air con units that have seen better days, confused wait staff. We’re not on to a great start are we? Well, the concept of this restaurant is good – limited menu serving simple food, done well. In this case, steak frites is the star menu item but unfortunately the restaurant’s standards are slipping very fast. This was my first time sitting indoors here and before I even looked at the menu, I noticed that the once-impressive chandelier above my head, was missing several light bulbs. It looked dreadful! Directly in my line of sight was an aircon unit that looked dusty and mouldy, quite frankly disgusting! Why did I stay on? Well, because I’d been here before and the food had been good on those occasions, so I thought I’d ignore the cosmetic aspects of the restaurant and look forward to a nice steak. Had a hard time getting a waiter’s attention and it was 15 minutes before I even got a glass of water. No matter, we proceeded to order our food. We then noticed that all the tables around us got a bread basket, but not us. We ordered fillet steaks, one of the best cuts on the menu, and when mine arrived (ordered to be cooked ‘medium’), it was so burnt it left a nasty aftertaste! I requested this to be changed as it was unpalatable and as is usual in Singapore, the waiter had to “check with the manager” first. The manager / Maitre D’ was very courteous and helped to fix the situation immediately, no questions asked. The frites were a different story altogether – greasy, limp, with a few burnt bits scattered in for good measure. And the salad? If you like soggy leaves drizzled in so much vinegar it would make you wince, then come here. It’s like the kitchen staff have completely lost their passion for cooking – this was such a miserable experience. Perhaps it’s time for the management and staff to take a break, shut the doors and overhaul everything about this restaurant."
French,Paul,huge disappointment,negative,10,29-Jul-13,"Over the past years we ate breakfast at Paul Dubai regularly. Furthermore, we had good experience at Paul outlets in France.We must agree with most of the points raised from those who reviewed Paul. Customers who have patronised Paul certainly know what to expect. The cafe decor and sitting are impressive. However, the food and service need serious improvement.Coffee was normal but came only half cup full. Most of the menu dishes are served with toast bread rather than something ""french"". Omelette, mushroom came cold and looked pathetically cheap. Most of all, you had to ask for butter and jam! And they ran out of strawberry jam, which is the hallmark of Paul.If they want customer to return, they have to put their act together and bring back the real Paul's quality and image."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just as good as ever ...,positive,50,04/25/12,"This was my favourite restaurant when I worked in Singapore a few years ago. At that time it was in Marina Bay, now it has moved to Dempsey Road. It didn't disappoint. The friendly staff, excellent service and brilliant food were all in evidence as they had been previously."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood at dempsey,negative,30,04/20/13,"Comveniently located at dempsey so you don't have to go all the way to east coast to eat the same thing. Crowded on a thursday evening, so business is bustlingWe ordered a set menu as there were 20 of us. Started with bamboo clams with a good amount of garlic. Then there was fried fish with sweet sour gravy, average stuff. The crispy skin chicken is usually popular. Then the main event, pepper crabs, which were good. The carbs was spicy malay noodles mee goreng, which was tastyOverall it was ok, as it's so mass produced these days as it's tough to rate such a joint as exceptional"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wow-what an experience! ,positive,50,14-Dec-15,All we ordered was absolutely delicious. Very talented young chef. We were amazed with every bite! High quality tuna!
French,Paul,Loved it! ,positive,40,11-Jul-16,Loved their food. Went there 4 times in a span of 7 days. Had lunch the first time. Chicken ratatouille was super juicy. The breakfasts were excellent. My complete omelette with the smoked salmon was delicious. Fresh orange juice was refreshing. Mom in law and wife had the seared Mediterranean fish which was excellent too. Will try their fancy dessert items next time.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A good preview at The Bar,positive,40,11-Aug-18,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit at The Bar at Waku Ghin, with a more casual dinner setting and delicious cocktails. The grilled vegetables with anchovy sauce was simple but well prepared. I also enjoyed the trout and the wagyu steak. Dessert choices were beautifully presented on a tray and we ended up with the chocolate cake. Service was warm and friendly, they even gave me the cocktail recipe of the ""sake-margarita"" that I really liked."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner ,positive,40,6-Oct-18,Decided to try this much heard about ala carte buffet for my birthday dinner. Food is above average with lots of choices from the menu. From sashimi to sushi to tempura to yakitori and many others. Sashimi was fresh and portion is served accordingly to the number of people. But service was a bit slow and orders left out towards the end thus it took a long time but was rectified after the supervisor was informed. Overall it’s definitely worth a visit but perhaps not on a weekend where the restaurant is really packed. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper and chilli crab,positive,40,11/25/12,"A jug of tiger beer? A few crabs? And a nice relaxed balcony. What more can you ask for?We ordered 2 crabs, a black pepper and a chilli. Both were amazing, the vote was split but best vote went to the black pepper. We almost ordered the Alaskan king crab (deadliest catch style) but at $600 we decided otherwise. also had some bok choy, prawns and some donut bread things that went very well with the chilli crab sauce. No one was hungry afterward, always a good sign for a crab house. A must do for seafood eaters when visiting Singapore. "
French,Saveur,Good food as usual,positive,40,30-Apr-16,Always a fan of the saveur pasta and duck confit. Waiting time was acceptable and service was generally good.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Dinner ,positive,50,10/19/17,We had an enjoyable dinner. Food are delicious and ambience are good. Thanks Terry for the great service. Will come back again ?
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not so good,negative,30,2-Sep-17,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. As usual, the sashimi were fresh. But the grill is not so good, either it's over cooked or too dry. It might be due to the crowded as the restaurant was packed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Japanese Buffet,positive,50,2-Feb-17,"Quality of the sashimi is good. Majority of the dishes are good. Overall, it's value for money as most of the items are good. They do have nice sake."
French,Saveur,Value for money,positive,40,24-Nov-16,Value for money but the service is slow. Small layout and selection is not large. Certain items are not available
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great ambiance and excellent food. ,positive,50,3-Oct-18,"My family has been going here for years. The food is fabulous and the service is always excellent. Though they only offer steak and fries as the main dish, there are many appetizers and desserts. You can view the menu on their website. I particularly recommend the French onion soup. The French fries are absolutely delicious and all you can eat. Highly recommended. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selection of tasty food,positive,40,05/19/18,"After a morning at Gardens by the Bay, my group of eight was famished. So we cabbed it to Yum Cha where we ordered so much food we were afraid we had overdone it. We hadn't. We ate it all. My mouth is watering remembering the meal. Four stars instead of five because service was a little chilly and a couple of dumplings were a little gummy (but we were at end of lunch service, which may have contributed to that)."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Mud Crab,positive,50,17-Jul-17,"What a hilarious experience! I had been told I had to have Chilli Mud Crab whilst in Singapore and one of the Taxi drivers I had (taxis are great and cheap) suggested that this was the place to go. I walked from Pan Pacific Orchard on a pleasant evening and duly ordered. So much food and so much mess eating it but it was delicious. Stall holders took great delight in telling to ""not be neat and use your hands"" and provided me with many additional napkins to help with the clean-up. there were dozens of stall selling an wide variety of food from the very cheap chicken rice through to the mud crabs which was a once in a visit experience. Definitely worth going to. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",If you want Michelin Star food in Singapore thats different then this is a MUST GO,positive,50,23-Aug-18,"My wife & I are on honeymoon,having got married after living together for over 35 years, so we wanted something different and we certainly found it at Waku Ghin , Top quality 2 star Michelin quality food that was very different to the majority of Michelin star restaurants , top ingredients that had been imported from all around the world & turned into a magical theatre of dishes.Their signature dish Sea Urchin was amazing ! All staff were so professional and attentive especially Kimme .We had the 10 course tasting menu, with wine pairing, very expensive but worth every penny because food & wine were TOP OF THE WORLD"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful service and good food,positive,50,5/11/2017,My 1st time visiting this restaurant and never disappoints me. Service is great and staffs are very attentive. My favorite is their signature Chilli Crab. I will recommend to my friends.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sea Urchin????,positive,50,20-Oct-15,"Based on the reviewers, I decided to try this restaurant. I am interested to visiting this place because, I can taste the pleasures of sea urchins.. and finalyyyy I tasted straight sea urchin ... and it offered a sense of truly exceptional.. WONDERFULL"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lost In Translation,negative,30,11-Jan-14,"Sindhi food is generally very unique and probably one of the best Indian option. But needs special culinary skills . KP though being Sindhi food, lacks altogether the Sindhi menu and Sindhi flavors. There are few options on the menu, but that is not what one would expect from such a restaurant.Even the least of Sindhi Paratha or Rajma or Sayal Bhaji is all missing.Overprices and is ok for perhaps one visit, till the restaurant gets all the sindhi dishes on the menu.Visited the one near the Mustafa this time, but have been to the Temple hugging one in the past. Both almost same."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice indian food...,positive,40,15-Mar-17,"We visited thrice during our stay. Nice place for some good veg indian food. Always crowded and busy, but the food and service is very good. Staff dont smile i dont know why, but rest is good. We had the bhalla papri chaat and it was very nice. Hyderabadi biryani should be improved, it comes with a palak gravy, which not how its suppose to be...!!"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Absolute Disaster,negative,20,11-Jan-18,"Typical take a number type of restaurant with a rude blighter at the counter. Messy and noisy to say the least and your order comes piecemeal as and when the cook gets a bigger batch.

French,Saveur,Experience soured by service,negative,30,25-Mar-16,"The food was excellent. Kudos to the chefs. Unfortunately the service staff could do with more training. Water not refilled, orders had to be repeated, 2 table settings for 3 pax. I lost count of the number of times my hand was raised to get their attention. Staff seemed more keen to interact amongst themselves than with customers. I'd only consider coming back to this outlet for the food."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Magnificent kitchen - let down by service arrangements,negative,30,10/7/2013,"This must be our sixth or seventh dinner at Peach Blossoms in the Marina Mandarin and we love the chef's signature dishes particularly Almond soup with fish maw and Wagyu beef. We have tried to get them to serve dishes selected sequentially but they always seem to come together without warming stands, so you either race the excellent food down your throat or eat some of it cold. Easily fixed by thinking about service logistics more. Also on this occasion the service was attentive to the point of being irritating - virtually watching you to swallow a mouthful or serve the last items from a dish before whipping it away. All in all felt like pressure to eat and get out, not assisted by the need to rush to eat the food while hot. It was not like this on previous occasions that we dined at Peach Blossoms so we will probably go again and see if we can get the dinner served in a sequence.At the prices charged, the restaurant fails to do justice to its excellent chef and needs to lift its game.David C"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Comfort food!,positive,40,16-Sep-12,"L'Entrecote is located at the increasingly trendy Duxton Hill area. I frequent this French bistro about once a month as it is consistently good. There is only one main course to speak of (steak & french fries) but a variety of excellent starters (and desserts) to choose from. They don't take reservations (which I think is good) and the idea is to stop by for a quick meal to satisfy your steak & fries craving rather than a long drawn-out 4 course meal. You get the feeling that they want to turn tables quickly (which is fair enough). The service is good nevertheless.Last night we started with a bottle of their house red - a generic Bordeaux that carries the L'Entrecote label. We were sitting in the outside area watching the place fill-up (it's been full every time I've visited). We were a little disappointed by the wine: under-ripe, unoaked red with too much Merlot probably. But for $49 you can't really complain.We moved inside and moved onto a lovely 2010 Cotes du Rhone which at $99 was still excellent value I think. One criticism I do have of the place is the rather small servings - I either have to order 2 starters (plus the main) or a starter and 2 mains (!). I can highly recommend the roasted bone marrow on toast with sea salt - the best I've tasted in Singapore! The escargots are similarly very good.As for the 'plat du jour', the beef is juicy and tender and cooked to your preference ('bleu' for me) but the frites are rather mediocre and could be much better.In summary, a lovely place and I look forward to going back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinning experience,negative,30,5-May-17,Not crowded when we go In the afternoon. Service so so not the typical Italian or French restaurant service. If there's lunch set would be good.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner,positive,40,15-Dec-15,"We were in singapore during my gf's birthday. so I was picking something that aren't too expensive but wasn't too bad. The steak was recommended on a random blog I came across and the photo looked really good. It was a steak with fries. The steak was amazing!! Although it didn't look too good in picture, but it was absolutely wonderful. Too bad we only ordered one because we wanted to try other food. So we ordered the mussles too, but it wasn't that good. We also had escargot but they forgot about it so our appetizer turned into our dessert. It was hard to find because we didn't know our ways, and it was located in a mall next to some superstore. Good to try, but probably not going to go again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good restaurant for dim sim lovers near Chinatown,positive,40,05/19/17,The bill for 4 is from 70 to 100 SGP including refilled Jasmine tea. Good place to have lunch while other restaurants open after 12 which is quite late for my stomach. Try Crispy salmon skin and Shark fin with meat dumplings.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Omakase the way I like it,positive,50,4-Dec-11,"Omakase roughly translates to ""chef's recommendation"". @ Shinji, you get to choose the chef you want to serve you. The sashimi is always fresh...and sometimes, the chef will share a joke with you. (I particularly find one chef really cute! :) ) My fave at Shinji is the uni (sea urchin) which can be served in so many ways...whatever the chef deems the best way to serve it. Sometimes, it's in season and you'll have a range of choices. There are different omakase sets to choose from and I usually go for the $250 set menu (excluding taxes and service charge). The lunch set starts from $75. I have yet to try the dinner omakase set. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi in Singapore now I m convinced,positive,50,7-Apr-15,"Title says It all, and I am very very very demanding about Sushi ...probably one of the only two places in Singapore that comes close to the quality which you can get in the top places in Tokyo"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The best,positive,50,30-Oct-17,"Having been warned by a friendly taxi driver to agree prices before we placed the order, we braved a visit here. The result was one of the best meals - Chilli Crab of course. We were lucky to pick The Ocean BBQ ( stall 16) run by a gentleman by the name of Dino Marn. And so glad we did. All up including the taxi it cost us $100 for 2 including drinks. Well worth it."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim-sum quality deteriorated a lot,negative,20,4/7/2017,"I have dined in this restaurant 2 years ago and the quality is very good. This time when I went there for dim-sum again, found out their quality deteriorated a lot. All the dim-sum are pre-made and pre-steamed, after we placed order within 5 minutes all the dim-sum is served on our table. By the taste you can tell they have been sitting around in the kitchen for a while. With its price, I expect the quality to be higher with made-to-order dim sum. This restaurant is not very busy, I do not see a need to pre-steamed all dim-sum and serve in a speed of fast food restaurant. Will not recommend it. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good curry fish head,negative,30,2-Jan-16,"Food wise not too bad service reasonable, a little pricy, with most dishes, nothing very special about the dishes, which is available at others but at a Budget price."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Avoid this place!,negative,10,11/22/12,"Terrible service, food without taste and very rude crew. Be careful! They even charge for the napkins.

It was late when we reached. We were dead hungry and there was waiting list for more then 30 mins. It was irritating but no option. We knew Kailash parbat as its present in Mumbai at many locations and its quite good. At last when we got the seats and we ordered, thankfully order was delivered quite quickly.The food was delicious and exactly like we have in India.Everything ordered was delicious.

The price is wallet friendly, considering it's Japanese, its located in Singapore and its eat as much as you desire. Its not cheap but affordadable for Singapore. Importantly, the food is really good., actually its great. Authentic (I've lived in Japan) and you can eat asquickly or as slowly and relaxed as you wish.Drinks are reasonably priced too (by Singaporean standards).Good enough to return? Absolutely.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worth the visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey,positive,40,4/9/2013,"It was an adhoc decision to try out the chilli crab at Long Beach. There were no tables available when we reached there and we had to wait for about 25mins or so for our table, we were a bit agitated at first due to the long wait. However the moment we were seated, the service was excellent, we were approached by this lady call May Lim to order and she's so considerate to ensure we don't over order since there were only 4 of us. We ordered the famous chilli Sri Lankan crab, deep fried squid, stir fry baby kailan and a simple fried rice. The chlli crab was excellent! It's my first time tasting Singaporean chilli crab and it's really really delicious and the crab meat was solid, perfect dish to go with the fried mantou. Even the deep fried squid was really good too. The supervisor May Lim will check with us whether the food is good and ensure everything is ok, very good service indeed. Will definitely recommend people to try out this place."

We ordered Set A and 3 other ala carte items for 12 adults. What impressed me, besides the delicious food, was their thoughtfulness and attention to little details! The delivery man carried all the food to the allocated place, which required him to climb up the stairs. Then, he took out a disposable table cloth and started laying all the food. I offered to help but he kindly declined, saying it is part of his job. What impressed me further was the fact that my delivery came with disposable cutlery that was catered for more then 20 adults and even had several garbage bags! Wow, I am really impressed! Each of us paid $11 for this delivery and we definitely agree that the portions could feed another 3 adults for sure! Thumbs UP for Yum Cha! You are a gem!"

French,Paul,It's Paul after all.,positive,40,9-Feb-16,"Friendly and helpful staff, with a relaxing atmosphere, good for chitchats.We were looking for dessert and the colourful tarts and pies attracted us. There, we were treated to a colourful array of yummy treats, so many that we took a long time to decide what to have. My friend went for the Mandarin orange tart, which is really good - sweet succulent canned oranges on a crunchy tart base, not too sweet and not too tart. With it she had the rosemary lime tea, which I tried and was not very impressed. It is too herby for a coffee lover like me.I had the almond and apple tart (flan Normandy), which was a bit sweet for my preference, but still tasted good. It had roasted almond flakes on top which I loved.. The coffee I had is Cafe Glace, which is fancy terms for an espresso shot with a nice vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate. The coffee is a bit sour in the beginning, so so let the ice cream melt and do its magic, which became very good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood,positive,40,07/14/18,"Food is consistently well executed here. Black pepper crab is always a favourite - it’s not overly peppery and the crabs are always cooked well. The razor clams were delicious though it doesn’t come cheap. The sweet chilli crab is not the best for me as it has a strong tomato taste but others seems to enjoy that.Service wise, it always seems slightly haphazard."

Paneer (cheese) Batura y Chole3. Ras Malai4. Bhelpuri.The place has no ambience. Went to wash hands..wash basin was dirty. The waiters are always in a hurry in a bid to make you empty your table as soon as one has finished eating.Prices, quite reasonable.Do I recommend? yes, especially for the deserts.Will I return? Yes, most definitely."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,VERY thirsty after eating here,negative,30,06/21/16,"I do not want to make accusations of what ingredients were put in here, but after my tim sum tea break here with my friends, we ALL felt extremely thirsty an hour later. We all suspect that more than just salt was added to make the food all so tasty (and indeed the food was very good). But tasty food should not be due to adding (that particular ingredient) and I am most disappointed. I aint coming back here ANYMORE."
French,Paul,"Poor service, obviously shorthanded",negative,30,30-Jun-15,"I enjoyed my food at Paul, they are well known for their croissant. The fragrance is irresistible. However, they are very shorthanded. Their water is served after being reminded for 3 times. To take order, I have to ask for service twice as well as getting the bill.Would not go there during peak hour."

French,Poulet,"poor food, lousy service",negative,10,3-Nov-13,"Ordered 2 lamb shanks with 1 chips and 1 gratin potato sides along with 2 latte's.Lamb shanks arrived after only about 5 mins, and though nice and tender were only warm. Had to start eating these as they were going cold and had to ask 3 times for our side orders which eventually turned up over 5 mins later., the fries were nice but the potato in the gratin was over cooked. got asked 3 times while waiting for coffees which were average if we wanted to order anything else. I also refused to pay the service charge for such bad service and food quality."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",exquisite sushi,positive,50,12-Sep-15,"We had an exquisite lunch at the Shinji Raffles Hotel. The short menu is of 9 sushi courses, mostly tuna. The tuna simply melts like butter in the mouth and the service was wonderful. Pricey at $200 but you are paying for quality."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice but not Wow,positive,40,11/13/16,"One of the good Cantonese restaurants in Singapore with ‘prestige’ ambience and professional service. It has never scored below 7.5 in my personal scale of 1 to 10 but also never above 9. This meal proved no different.Unlike the last time, I was a guest and therefore did not choose the meal. I probably would not have chosen what my host chose given that there were only three of us. To start, she chose ginseng oolong tea. Crisp with only a slight after taste of the ginseng. The only problem is that it does not go well with all dishes and clashed with two dishes in particular. Stock to the Imperial Pu Er or have it at the end of the meal.We started with mushrooms in white truffle oil. I do not like truffle oil at the best of times (though I would make an exception for the lobster and glass noodles at the Imperial, Asia Square) and the oil did little to highlight the subtle ‘fifth’ flavor of the mushrooms. The crispy roast pork was very good. Dry to the touch, moist underneath with no fatty after taste. The jasmine tea smoked chicken clashed badly with our tea but the other two did not seem to mind. Maybe I am too fussy. Because of my decision to no longer eat things that are or could be endangered, she gave the shark fin and birds nest a miss. Instead we had the restaurants’ version of Monk Jumps over the Wall. It is notoriously difficult to get right but at this meal it was the standout dish. The steam fish, whilst good, was too much after the sensory and stomach overloading soup. The braised rice vermicelli with fish and bitter gourd again clashed with the tea. However, the coconut pudding with its three layers and unconventional pairings of different parts of the coconut left me again revising the meal upwards again. 8 out of 10 methinks."
French,Paul,a great French dining,positive,40,5-Nov-15,"I usually prefer to patronize Paul before noon for a hearty brunch, a time when the crowd is thinner and the queue more acceptable. I prefer a seat within, admiring the interior decor reminiscent of European styles but sometimes I can only get a seat outside of the cafe, staring at patrons of the mall and get stared back in return.Sometimes I get myself a choice from the usual caffeinated suspects, and if I am not up for a cup of tea or coffee, then I would choose from their other beverage selections. I loved their Chocolat Frappé à la Menthe from its Ice Blend section for its menthol sensation mixed well into the rich chocolaty taste, and I feel the urge sometimes to get to this restaurant for a cup of refreshing Lemongrass Iced Tea, its acquired taste a tang against my taste buds.Their menu is quite varied and, of course, very French. So far my favorite remains Roulade de Poulet, a dish of stuffed chicken with pumpkin puree."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dumplings and other yummy...,positive,40,10/16/14,"meals are served in the nice location in a Shophouse in the middle of Chinatown - if you do not have the exact location, the restaurant is a little hard to find! Great food...not very very cheap, but very reasonable. Service....well, Singapore like most of the times! Still a place I would send people to go to and enjoy...top tip: dessert: Glutinous rice balls in a Ginger Tea. A must try...!!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at amazing price,positive,50,17-Jun-17,"I genuinely think Newton Hawker Center is better than Lau pa Sat. Environment is better and the sellers aren't as pushy as the ones in Lau pa Sat! And it closes at 2am on weekends I believe! If you are going on Friday evening then consider go a bit early like 6-7ish so you can grab seats for you and friends or family, before eveyone else starts to show up. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good food, clean and helpful",positive,50,19-Dec-14,I visited kailash parbat restaurant on serangoon road Singapore with my kid who does not eat spicy food. The restaurant was able to customise their menu to suit his taste. We took him there twice thereafter. The ambience is clean and hygienic. The food is tasty and they have very good options within Indian food. Kailash parbat is famous for its chat but I didn't try that. I tried North Indian and it was good. The staff is helpful and able to comprehend our needs. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,BAD!!!!,negative,20,10-Aug-12,I used to go often when I first moved to Singapore and I slowly noticed how down the hill this place was going...hopefully one day it will get submerged by the river. A pity since the atmosphere is nice. I rather cook my own steak than eat here.
French,Saveur,Quick lunch,negative,30,16-Jul-16,"Come here for quick lunch and order their set lunch. Their signature pasta quite nice, main course that i order is chicken roulade with risoto (ok not bad). Dessert is the winner for me that is pistachio pannacota. Quite sweet but but nice or maybe because i like peanut.The ambience rather ok. As the service considered not bad."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Bad choice of plce to savour local Singapore food,negative,20,30-Apr-12,Touristy and expensive. Stalls basically sells the same things.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Right place to try Dim Sum in singapore,positive,50,11/16/17,"With review from trip advisor wanted to try some original dim sum . The ones we get in India are the indianised version with 3 choices .( steamed fried or Schzwan ) . We tried 5 of the numerous choices ( Xiao Long Bao ,Fish Roe with Siew Mai ,Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ,Fried Carrot Cake , and a green colored open looking one forgot the name ). The Crab meat with Thick Corn Soup was plenty for us a family with 2 kids . we also had Braised Ee-Fu Noddles and the total bill after tips was 80 SGD . Most of the crowd where locals and YUM CHA is placed partly hidden in china street . But if you can look in google street view in maps I think you can easily locate the place . except for the fried carrot cake and the endless jasmine tea we loved all the food . it is an excellent try out for anyone looking for exceptional food in Singapore . The asst captain( as the badge read ) was a pleasent and very helpful girl and the atmosphere can't be better as we are in china town .You are reminded that it is china town so don't expect plates forks knifes e.t.c . When in Rome be a Roman . I looked at the way the locals where eating with chopsticks and bowl and followed suit ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gotta eat here,positive,40,8-Apr-15,"I ate at the pirates seafood, aiming for chilli crab. It was a big, juicy, delicious food. I ordered normal hot one, and it was almost sweet to me. If you're indonesian, 'saos padang' crab is much more tasty n spicy than this. The price is 5sgd/100 g for the crab. A very friendly n hopeful seller.This place is huge, you can find almost ant kinds of food here. Next time i go to sg, i will come here again for different food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at reasonable prices!,positive,40,04/20/17,"Brought an overseas visitor here for dinner and he liked the cozy and green location. We ordered black pepper and chilli crabs + fried mantou . We absolutely loved the black pepper crabs and finished these in record time, so we ordered a second plate. The chill crab paled in comparison although it went well with the mantou. I found the chilli crab on the sweet side and too gooey. The steam prawns were fresh and sweet and the fried kailan done to perfection. Overall, a very good enjoyable meal at reasonable prices."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Authentic Japanese food served,positive,50,28-Dec-17,The food served was fresh and delicious while service was excellent with the staffs always providing attentive service
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The Best Sushi You'll Ever Eat,positive,50,19-Jan-15,"I had a superlative experience at Shinji for lunch. So many reviews said they were top notch so I was skeptical when I arrived. It was a Monday & I didn't have a reservation. No matter as the seats around the sushi counter were not all filled. Opting for the most luxurious or Omakase lunch (at S$250 a small fortune). But what was served was freshness itself & well worth the price though dining here would have to remain a treat, not an everyday meal. The omakase comprised a selection of sashimi, sushi, soup & dessert. I'd have to say my favourites were the platter of mixed sashimi ranging from mackerel to scallop. There was also a very clean tasting seaweed soup with scallops to begin with & was very pure but satisfying. Of all the sushi, I'd have to say my favourites were chutoro (tuna belly) and aji (horse mackerel). This is not a conveyor belt sushi restaurant so please resist the urge to dunk every piece of sushi in shoyu. The rice is slightly warm (in my opinion heightens the flavour & freshness of the fish) and you can taste the fish which is flown in from Japan all the better if unmasked by the soy. The meal was rounded off by a clam broth & the most perfect Japanese fresh fruit - musk melon & persimmon. You could not ask for more. I'd certainly return but perhaps opt for the less extravagant offerings as every meal here is an experience. You owe it to yourself to go. Chef Yoshi who serve me was attentive & professional as were the rest of the servers."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food!,positive,40,08/27/16,We have been going to Crystal Jade regularly and we never grow tired of the food they serve. It's delicious!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and good service,positive,50,1/6/2015,"We went there twice during our trip, recommended by our local friends. The service is great. They are honest with weighing the market price seafood. All dishes are tasty. We like the Razor clams with garlic. The prawns in herbal soup is also good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummilicious Jap Food,positive,40,18-Jul-17,"If you will like to enjoy a satisfying and legit Japanese food, Shin Minori is the right place. Went for their lunch buffet. Definitely worth every cents and calories. One of the best Sashimi (Salmon and Swordfish) in town and I am always spoilt for choices for their selection of maki. Oh yeah, they serve one of the best Pumpkin Chawamushi which is a MUST try. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience,positive,50,11-Jul-16,What a selection - food in Singapore is very safe to eat as very strict guidelines apply. Great selection of food in Hawkers markets. Find a table and note the number on table. Order and pay for food from the many different little food stalls providing table number - When food or drinks are ready stall worker brings to table.

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Food quality has decreased significantly since our last visit,negative,10,13-Dec-15,"We had so much expectation from this place. However, food quality had dropped so much. We ordered cold cut and escargot as appetizers. Escargot was salty, fishy and oily. We ordered 1kg steak for 2 share. 1/3 of it was fats and bones that we couldn't eat! Our billed ended up to be $400. We will never come back! "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistent in their food quality and service,positive,50,28-Jul-17,"We frequent this restaurant often and the service and food is always good. The french onion soup is delicious. We normally get the steal frites and if not too full, we get a caramel lava cake. Be careful not to order too many appetizers or you will be too full for dessert. The house red is also very good. Highly recommended making a reservation if you plan to go as it gets quite busy. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet (Using Birthday Voucher),positive,40,21-Feb-18,"Sashimi was fresh and in thick slices. However, the chawanmushi and the bbq stuff wasn't that great thought it doesn't matter as we are here for the Sashimi. Need to arrive early so that the wait for the orders will not be too long."

French,Angelina_MBS,Enjoyable afternoon ,positive,40,1-Jan-16,"Dined at Angelina twice this year 1) Dinner for 2 : good food, although a tad expensive 2) Tea w friends: great dessert (lemon cheesecake is very ""lemony"" which I love) and the Negresco. Great coffee. We sat upstairs and it was an oasis of calm & solitude amidst the busyness of being downtown. "
French,Paul,bad service,negative,20,19-Nov-16,"i personally dont come to a restaurant just to eat but also i come for the experience and service, which this place has lack of. most of the waiter were so obnoxious, especially the one who serve us (young local guy with thick framed glasses). the food is just okay for the price, not perfect and a bit pricey for what the serve."
French,Paul,A delicious French bakery/restaurant,positive,40,3-Aug-15,"Tanglin Mall, which has everything from clothing to toys to groceries, was close to the hotel in which my husband and I stayed on a recent trip. While in the mall, we had a wonderful lunch at Paul’s Bakery. I had salade carpaccio with zucchini and rocket salad (arugula) with balsamic glaze. Wonderful. My husband had Tourte Provençal - a tart of eggplant, zucchini, tomato and Parmesan sandwich, which he enjoyed. The French bread was as good as it gets. For dessert we split a Palmier (elephant ear), and each had a cappuccino, topped with a beautiful design made in the foam. The service wasn’t what we might have liked, but we thoroughly enjoyed the lunch, attractive to both the taste and the eye. A delicious bakery and restaurant that we recommend."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fresh seafood, but . . .",negative,30,10/13/12,"We went to Dempsey Hill to try the seafood at Long Beach. First, we didn't make any reservation so we had to wait a while; also, without the reservation, I guess, we didn't get to have the good tables. They placed us in the lower 'deck', where lighting was poor. Furthermore, behind our table were what looked to be storage for dirty plates... it marred the already dark ambiance. We ordered the popular dishes - black pepper crabs, buttered prawns, fried kangkong with cuttlefish. While we waited for the food, they handed out a small of peanuts which was not bad at all. When the food came, they looked lovely (sadly, twas just dark for me). The black pepper crabs were huge, but I have tasted better versions. The buttered prawns tasted really fresh. The kangkong with cuttlefish was very spicy; I would suggest you avoid this unless you are really used to 'hot' and spicy dishes. The staff were attentive. All in all, I had hoped they kept their standards by maintaining the same bright environment all through the eating areas. It would have made a lot of difference in our dining experience.As tourists, we came to Dempsey Hill via the taxi; after dinner, we found out twas quite hard to get a ride back to the hotel, so we walked down the road to where Dempsey road exits. There we saw a small stand near a wide parking space. here was a man whose only trade was to serve durian fruit. As we were curious, we sat down one of the stools and ordered for a sweet durian fruit (you can choose sweet, bitter sweet and bitter)... it tasted really good! it didn't have a strong smell (the taxi driver told us, the riper, the less odor), and the man offered disposable hand gloves! I would suggest you end your seafood dinner with this fresh sweet treat!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton food center,positive,50,12-Jun-17,"I was brought here by a family member when i visited Singapore back in April. By the time i visited this one, we already ate at a few other food centers. I think after Lau Pa Sat this was my favorite of them. I let the host order most of the food so im not exactly sure where the food we had ordered came from but it was all so good. We came for dinner and the place was quite crowded but we were able to get a table under the overhang. We were looking for a table out in the open but they were all taken already. Noteable foods we had here, roast duck, char kway kway, baby gai lan, oyster omelette. I enjoyed everything here and thinking about the food is making my mouth water."
French,Poulet,Reasonable price. Good quality food. ,positive,40,13-Dec-14,"Recommend their signature roast chicken and the mash potato. Definitely suitable for families of all ages. mash potato could be serve to the kids, yummy and average portion to share. Another to try is their escargot. I liked the way how it is served and most importantly the salsa sauce. Flavoursome! Will definitely go back again. "

The roast duck was fabulous and remain consistently good for the longest time.But after a recent visit in July 2017 standards had seriously fallen. And not surprisingly, no queues in sight !

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent value for money,positive,40,20-Aug-17,"When it was too late to go anywhere for dinner, the concierge at our hotel suggested that we go to Newton Hawker Centre for a bite. The place was super crowded even after 11 pm, and everybody there seemed to be enjoying a hearty, and by the looks of it, exotic, meal. We stuck to our favorites, kungpao chicken and fried rice, with pork dumplings on the side. It was quite a satisfying meal, and didn't cost too much too."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elegance and attention to detail,positive,50,15-Dec-14,"My wife and I treated ourselves for lunch at the sushi counter at Shinji. The menu is based on either 9 piece, 12 pirec of 15 piece meal for sushi. omakase is over the top expensive for lunch at SGD$250++. the 9 piece foes fo $75++ and and 12 piece for $125++. The maths did not work out but the quality in the 3 extra I had made the difference in price! Very Japanese - waitresses all were Japanese, clad in Kimonos and the service was discreetly attentive. The sushi came with huge chunks of fish - as fresh as can be. The attending sushi chef explains each morsel as he makes it one at the time. He even paces the courses so that we are in ""sync"" A great meal - ate with my hands as recommended and the odour of fresh sardine lingered on for the afternoon on the fingers! Worth an experience just to splurge."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just not worth it!,negative,10,12/25/16,"Tried this restaurant for the second time. First time it was when it had just opened and the experience was not good. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and put it down to the teething problems of a business at the start. So, now after some time I decided to give it another try. Bottom line, I shouldn't have done so. Nothing changed. It is still the same terrible food, indifferent service and expensive for what it is. You are certainly better off in every aspect to go to the nearest food court or hawker center."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Would hv rated as 'Excellent' if not for captain Zhou Ling,negative,30,1/1/2013,"I had to wait for my eldest daughter to return from Melbourne before visitng Yum Cha again bcos she loves dim sum alot. So, together with my family I bought along my mother to sup before 2013 appears. We found new dishes eg chocolate pretzel sticks which are Pork Springrolls, the very colorful Baked Cheese Seafood tarts & the Chive Dumpling. They are good, give them a try. Our fav & Best dishes are still the Durian dumpling (moochi), Beijing Duck, Crispy Red Bean paste wt Banana pancake, Century Egg congee, siu mai, har kao, phoenix claws, carrot cake, etc. One particular dish that seem to drop standard is the Char Siu chee cheong fun which used to have thinner & softer skin. A standing ovation we would give to is waitress Ms Leong Lai Chee for her excellent service & beautiful waiting attitude. She carried out her duties without any flaws but full of our praises and profesionally done. Our cups were continually filled up without having to remind her at any moment, hats off to her. She cleared our used plates promptly & timely and replenished with new ones efficiently and courteously, everytime with a genuine smile on her face. The climax was when she efficiently served us the Beijing Duck with such promptness. She made our lunch a great JOY indeed. I was very disappointed with the Captain who first attended to us when we stepped in, Ms Zhou Ling despite only 3 tables in the hall at the point we were seated. She seemed to display both in action and vocal tone that she's either serving us out of obligation or out of reluctance. Her physical gestures combined with her facial expresssions and her sarcastic tone of voice when she answered our enquiries or during serving us were congruent to poor service as a Captain. We felt we were not welcomed, if not for Ms Leong & subsequently for Captain Ivy Lim's presence. Halfway through our feasting, Captain Ivy Lim replaced Zhou Ling (we dont know for what reasons). She was bubbly and excited to see us dining as a family. In fact, with her presence she brighten up our dining experience with her resourcefulness and cheerfulness, unlike Zhou Ling's lethargic & unwelcoming body language. Next, is our praises to aunty Ong Ah Choo, who never failed deliver dishes with a good-feeling attitude and genuine smile everytime we dined here, countless times already. This is the real 'unsung heroine' whom many customers take for granted and would never mention good of her to management. Such is the character that made my family want to come back again and again besides the cosy clean ambience, the good food and the correct pricing. One of the very best take away we would buy home is the sambal belachan. Die die must try. My family reckons and votes this to be the very best in the whole of Singapore. Kudos to the chef."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth visiting,positive,40,10-Aug-17,This is a popular Hawker center both among locals and visitors. There are dozens of food stalls selling all kinds of things. Seafood is very popular here. I tried the singapore chilli jumbo crab and Bun and it was fantastic. However the price is not transparent in the sense that the stalls don't show you the weight of the fish or prawn they cook. But worth visiting of course.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap good eats,positive,40,23-Mar-15,"Went here for an early lunch. A fair bit was closed but easily enough to make it difficult to choose. We had a spicy stingray, noodle dish, a buttery chicken. Cant remember everything but overall we were stuffed and very good food. The butter chciken was disappointing and we didnt ask the price before receiving the dish and paid far too much so ALWAYS negotiate beforehand if its not written on the board. "

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner at Waterway Point,positive,40,03/13/16,"This restaurant is located at the newly opened Waterway Point at 83, Punggol Central #01-23.You could travelled by bus, LRT and taxi to this Mall.It serves various roasted duck dishes, Hong Kong Congee and noodles, Rice, dim sum, seasonal vegetables, desserts and beverages.Their Signature dishes are London Roast Duck, Barbecue Pork with Honey Sauce, Black Pepper London Duck Bun, Steamed Cheong Fun.The filling of this Cheong Fun is a fried spring roll with prawn. Very unique but please consume while it is hot.The Hong Kong Wanton Noodle and their Golden Custard Bun is a must try dishes.Their Buns surprised me in a way that the skin of normal buns are steamed soft; but their outlook are like biscuit form which are dry. But the buns must be consumed while hot.Those who likes duck dishes should give it a try. But the waiting time is not very encouraging. We waited for 40 mins before a table is available."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Bad service and they steal cameras ,negative,10,05/24/14,"Had such a terrible dinner here I eat a lot of Chinese food all over the world and this by far is the worst I have ever had.The waitresses were so rude and never explained what the food was when they put it down,had to ask for soya sauce. We were on a china town tour.The staff just stand there and stare at you like your a criminal,they refuse to remove dishes it was getting pretty crowded with 8 people at the table. Also when leaving one of the people apart of our group went to the bathroom and on her return her camera had been stolen by a staff member. This is terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the tour.I would never eat here again due to the lack of service and rudeness. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum is good,positive,40,07/26/15,"The decor is nothing special and I've seen greater variety of Dim Sum selection, however the six Dim Sum dishes we ordered were very fresh and tasty, the price was okay - not too cheap (about 5 SGD per steam basket) but fine for what we got for the money. Staff seemed busy even though the restaurant was only half full, but were helpful when we needed anything."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very nice and tasty lunch,positive,50,9-Jun-18,The lunch choices were very good. The food quality was very good and even the quantity was enough for 2 people in 1 vegetable.
French,Paul,Worst cafe experience ever,negative,10,25-Jun-17,"Very difficult to catch the waiters attention to take orders, get the bill, etc... get completely ignored, even when sitting in front of them. Food and drinks are alright but not worth the price given the bad service."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Value For Money,positive,50,23-Sep-15,"Great Vegetarian food, located at multiple locations, very fast service, reasonable price, value for money"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Splendid Dining Experiences,positive,50,10/11/2018,Booked a table for 12 to celebrate Nephew's ROM. We had a wonderful evening on that day! We enjoyed the awesome food as much as Terry's innovative and surprised gifts to the wedding couple. Thanks to Terry's arrangement for the food menu and we loved all the dishes. The service was efficient and attentive. Plates were changed as soon as it gets a little messy. We never have to worry about tea top ups! Thanks to Terry and his team for an unforgettable evening!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A favourite place.,positive,40,06/17/11,"Well, despite the place being busy and often a bit noisy we always enjoy this place when we go to Sing. The Dim Sum are good ,at times very good. with a wide choice. If you arent getting what you want then try a bit harder and be nice to the staff, they a generally rushed off their feet. Ordering rather than waiting for trolleys ensures you get served The main i.e. non dim sum menu is fine and the food is goood. Bargain dealls for early morning and afternoon. The best DS place in Sing, or KL for that matter."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Fun, slight chaotic but enjoyable",positive,40,9/4/2012,"Being from out of town the concierge recommended Yum Cha for Dim Sum. If you are looking for a quite, intimate meal, Yum Cha is not the place for you. Of course there was a line and once you got in you got a feel for the rhythm and the controlled chaos. I had so much fun picking and choosing what to eat and asking for recommendations from the staff. I was not disappointed and all the flavors were new a enjoyable."
French,Angelina_MBS,Disappointing main courses,negative,20,3-Jul-16,"The service was alright, but the main courses we had were bad. The mushroom risotto tasted bitter with just a few strands of mushrooms. The scallop and truffle ravioli was just passable. The signature dessert - Mont Blanc was overly sweet for me."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food!,positive,40,9-Nov-12,"We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and everyday had food from ananda bhavan which is open 24 hrs. Food is very good and excellent service we had.
It is really helpful for the pure vegirarians who visit Singapore."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak has to be good to be acceptable...,negative,30,19-May-13,"Unfortunately, it was not. I have tried the little sister in Club St a couple of times and that. Has been pretty good. Tried the special. Entrecôte from Normandy but it disappointed. It was big, way too big but had no taste. Taste is the most important thing with steak. Wine was good and good value. Starters were also pretty good. Great if you like people watching but be careful with your choice....."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",So good that I went thrice in a 5 day trip !!,positive,50,25-Feb-18,"Amazing food, great service, and mouthwatering flavors. The taste of all the diverse menu is very authentic. This was the closest tasting food to that available in India I have tried in any country I have visited. Service is friendly and accommodative of special requests."
French,Paul,Almost perfect,positive,40,29-Aug-14,Delicious food and good tasting coffee. We had sandwiches and a croque Monsieur. Everything was very well prepared and tasted delicious. The sandwiches were baguettes and came -as the croque Monsieur - together with a side salad. Overall good value for money and authentic French taste!Could not give 5 stars since no wifi available there (strange for a café in the midst of Takashimaya-Mall)
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lovely Ambience with birds chirping,positive,40,11/9/2013,"We had lunch. The dim sum was very nice with quite a good variety. I don't eat meat, but friends I was with had the Peking duck and it was good. The meat dim sum was also very good.The service is excellent except the uniforms should be looked into. The slim waitresses look very good in them, however the plump and shorter waitresses look terrible in them and there was even one waitress that had a split near the zipper and was walking around without even knowing."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Gd for casual dining,negative,30,28-Oct-17,"Service and food was a little slow as the restaurant was quite busy, but food was ok. There was a good variety of food. And love the snow crab soup. Jus remember to print out the voucher."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, weird service",negative,30,09/29/13,"Can't go wrong with chili prawns, pepper crab, steamed garoupa and a great outdoor table and beer on a Saturday night. Love the fact that they peel and shell the fish for you so you don't even have to get messy as before. Only thing, can they ask servers who are obviously sick to stay home, instead of hacking their germs into my food as they prep it? Is that too much to ask in a civilized Sngapore?"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Another good japnese in Singapore,positive,50,9-Dec-14,A very nice decorated restaurant .cozy atmosphere minimalistic.three menus not cheap but very tasty combination of shashimi and sushi.worth trying.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",South Indian Idli shop,positive,50,21-Oct-16,Very good food quality & Service. Located opposite to Mustafa Mall. All south indian menu available with good test. This place very good for breaffast or you may take lunch also

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent food , great location",positive,40,3-Feb-18,"Really liked the food and ambience. Good indian taste, pure veg food. Fast service. Slightly overpriced but ok."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Instant service from ALL available staff,positive,50,3/7/2017,"First reputable restaurant where we got service from practically every staff who passes by. And it was from the manager to staff servicing other diners. The service started with the staff who settled us down and continuously came around to top up our tea cups and change our side plates to the manager who was passing by when we asked him to add some Tim Sum to our meal. Which he did immediately by writing them down and punching the order into the computer. We would have loved to order the a la carte Tim Sum buffet but it would had busted up too many diets. Just go and try it out. Better still stay in the hotel like we did many years ago, go back to the suite to drop everything after some shopping and wash up a little before going for a meal at the restaurant. Don't sign the bill to your hotel account as they always have credit card promotions on a la carte meals."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really a Tourist Trap,negative,20,14-Mar-13,"Good food stalls wouldn't park themselves here. Everyone here is out to make a big buck from innocent tourists. They had a renovation few years ago to spruce their image, but in the process much of the good food has run away from the obscene rentals. Only came here with a foreign friend who insisted on trying. He became receptive to my recommendations at other places after that meal."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),GOOD PRESENTATION,positive,40,11/11/2015,"We were being invited for set dinner by our uncle in Singapore. The food had 5 courses if i can remember.. The taste of the foods are great. the service is wow... the ambient is like a typical Chinese restaurant.. Overall, it was a nice experienced and great food. especially if it was being paid for. :)D"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of food but slow service,negative,30,5-Dec-17,"Liked the fact that the variety of food is really wide, but the service is really slow though. Some of our dishes took quite awhile to arrive, while others were forgotten. One came only when we were able to leave."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent food and great price,positive,50,29-Sep-15,"Great food, recommend you look for the lady who takes care of the seafood, chicken and beer stands. far side from the carpark on the side near the road/roundabout"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Tourist trap,negative,20,15-Jun-14,"The last time we ate here must have been at least two years ago. We had two vegetarian thalis, one North and one South, some drinks, and the bill came to $37-something.
We must have been suffering from momentary memory loss when we went yesterday...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",fantastic food,positive,50,2-Nov-17,very good selection. love how they had pumpkin in their chawanmushi. got to try their japanese fried rice and mentaiko spaggheti! Not salty yet fragrant! sashimi is melt-in-mouth even for tuna which normally doesn't taste well in most japanese restaurants! Price is very reasonable and service is quick!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Food and great service,positive,50,20-Apr-12,This was the best food and atmosphere we experienced for food in Singapore. The quality and price of the street food with the comfort of a restaurant
French,Paul,"Very bad service, the food is ok",negative,20,15-Jul-18,"I am a frequent Paul customer, mostly in the US and other Singapore Unit. The food at this Unit is fine, consistent with other Paul Units. However, the service is really bad. This is my third time here, either ordering food in the counter or sitting in a table, the servers are unprofessional, un-polite, and it looks understaffed. In order to get their attention, we need to wave and raise our voice. Once the servers come, they barely stop by your table and listen to you; mostly they take your order “on-the-run” and there is no opportunity to ask any clarification question from the costumers side. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Ready for long queues?,negative,20,3-Jul-17,"During peak hours this self service restaurant has long queues but insufficient seating area.
The chairs are low too inconvenience to elders or those with knee problems.
Food is fairly good but better restaurants are around the corner.
Try once.."
French,Paul,extremely BAD and TERRIBLE SERVICE!,negative,10,13-Apr-18,"ordered chicken breast flute on multigrain and prawn pasta, Only the pasta arrived and they forgot about the sandwich. I reminded them and waited . after 15 mins I reminded them again on my order and apparently the first waitress did not key in the order , the 2nd waiter send my order to another table! by the time my sandwich came is 30 mins later!. NO WORD OF SORRY SAID ! NO APOLOGY! ALL they did is give me a blank look~!!the waitress and waiter are badly 'trained' and rude! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!Good sandwich but EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE!don't even have basis service !shocking!I would rate your service below par!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very good food, neat area",positive,40,08/16/14,"We went here for dinner after a business project and was very impressed. We had chili crab (really good), black pepper crab (really, really good) fresh prawns, some coffee pork dish and some veggies ... everything was really quite excellent!"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Sumtuase Meal,positive,40,29-Apr-16,The thaali was quite wholesome ( excluding the vegetables that were not so well processed). The quantity was quite filling with traditional sides that are well thoughtfully provided. In a foreign land it was so relieving to see the tamil culture food being provided with...More
French,Paul,"Good food, appalling service",negative,20,18-Dec-16,"It seemed a good place to stop and enjoy a typically French snack and coffee. In a way it was. The coffee, tarte au citron and crepe were authentic. But OH DEAR, the service in Singapore is usually exemplar, not here! . We were left waiting to sit down as nobody seemed interested. Then we waited about 20 mins for coffee and longer for food. The same went for the bill. Then my Visa card disappeared for at least 10 minutes while they took it for payment. No smiles, no acknowledgement and hence, no tip. Shame, good food!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice dim sum,positive,40,7/6/2017,"Sui mai and ha gao are quite nice. But what I like most is chicken cooked in paper,chicken wings are tender and sauce is tasty,I can feel a scent of ginger and soya sauce."
French,Paul,Nice lunch at Paul,positive,40,3-Jul-13,"Not sure why I found so many bad reviews here. Because for me personally, the food are quite good. Yes, the coffees are weak but the bread selections from their bakery are really nice. A bit pricey for a light meal, expect to spend around S$30-35 for a meal and drink. Avoid long queues by coming early for lunch or dinner."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Bold claims but only good, not great.",negative,30,31-Oct-17,"We had a family dinner for 7 at their Katong Square outlet. Selection was decent enough and the sashimi was nice. Not what I would consider “great japanese ala-carte buffet” cos we’ve had better. Perhaps a sign of this was a really small number of tables were occupied tonight. Perhaps they make up during weekends. Sashimi was nice but not the best based on price. Tempura was nice but a bit on the oily side and batter wasn’t light enough. Pasta was sticking and clumping up. Grilled selection was either bland, which I’m ok with since I appreciate natural flavours but the sauce for some grilled selection like chicken liver was way too salty. Wasabi wasn’t evenly fresh with some bits with a lil kick but mostly bland. Grilled pork with garlic had an overkill of garlic to the point where it drowned out the flavour of the pork. All in all, good for a one time visit but I won’t be going back anytime soon. Good but not great. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Inconsistent dining experience.,negative,30,31-Dec-16,"This was my fourth time there. The food has been inconsistent, ranging from good when the restaurant is quiet to overcooked yakitori when the restaurant is crowded. The last visit I went. The restaurant had a company function. Service was slow, inattentive and the food was mostly dry and over-cooked. Not a good experience since I brought my bf's mother there for a treat"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very good dim sum! ,positive,40,8/10/2015,"This restaurant specialises in dim sum. We were advised to come to this place by family. We were told to expect to wait for table as it's always busy, we awaited approx 10 minutes for a table of 8. The way it works is each table has a list of all the food and drinks available and the food is cooked to go, some ladies bring the food round as it's cooked and you have to tell them what you want off the trolley and they write down how many you've hadn't the card, at the end of the meal you take the card to the till and pa for what you have eaten. You have to be patient because the trolley goes around the whole restaurant. You can order specific foods that aren't on trolleys and the waiter will order it to be cooked (again please be patient) it's not a quick service but the food is absolutely amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Food was alright,negative,30,6-Aug-18,"Went slightly earlier before the dinner crowd and noticed that the staff were rather unfriendly and unattentive at first. Ordered the XXL to share and was informed that fries and sauce would not be unlimited since it was for sharing, which was fine as the amount of fries given was more than enough for us and they kindly served the entire dish in two plates. The tables in the restaurant were rather close to each other. So much so that another’s bum would touch our table while trying to get into their seat next to our table. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",10/10 restaurant!,positive,50,28-Nov-16,Awesome service and even better food! We were promptly served and food always came hot and delicious. Seafood were extremely fresh and staff were polite and helpful. Never been happier! Highly recommend
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum lunch,negative,20,01/20/18,"Great service unfortunately matched with bad dim sum. Cold roast, soft spring roll skins, badly done up dumpling soup etc doesn’t justify the 30% higher price there. De Bao Dim Sum at the adjacent street is so much better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be Warned,negative,10,5-May-14,"2 years ago we were warned not to go to Newton Hawker Centre as it is a tourist trap. Previous years we had fantastic chilly crab. On the previous trip we could not go to the centre so we went this time. The chilly crab was a watered down tomato paste with a little chilly taste. The crab we chose was also not the same crab when it arrived. Previous years you got a receipt when you ordered your food and you paid straight away. Not this time. When we got the bill, they increased the amount. When we queried it, they got very aggressive. We refused to pay the amount. In the one corner of our table was a telephone no you phone if you feel done in. I started to phone that no and only then they started to change their attitude. We paid a lesser amount but still more than we were supposed to pay. BE WARNED and stay away. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious food and impeccable service,positive,50,02/17/17,"We booked a table for reunion dinner on the Chinese New Year’s Eve. The dishes were delicious with very nice presentation. The services were simply impeccable. The waitress who served our table presented each dish properly, and she politely introduce to us the auspicious meanings of the Cantonese dishes. She also suggested us order a bottle of wine instead of by glass, as it would be more cost efficient. It was a pleasant evening. We are planning to go there again, although it is a little bit pricey."
French,Saveur,Reasonably Priced,negative,30,21-Mar-17,"I've dined at Saveur many times at different branches and I think an issue with it is inconsistency. The pork belly I had here was alright but the skin was hard to chew on (as opposed to crackling skin I had previously). One point I have to make is that though the food is very reasonably priced, the glass of wine I ordered was very little! It was definitely less than a standard serving!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hectic and delicious!,positive,40,2-Dec-17,"This was my second visit, we visited a few years before and I was not ready for all the sprooking which at first put me off. Visiting again and being prepared for all the sprooking this time I enjoyed the experience a lot more. The place is very busy due to popularity, a lot of locals eat here too, not just tourists. There is so much to choose from and the food is absolutely delicious. Have to have some satay and watermelon juice!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",try nihon mura(cheaper) or kuishinbo (more variety),negative,20,12-Jul-08,try nihon mura(cheaper) or kuishinbo (more variety)
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disappointing ,negative,10,14-Nov-15,"Poor service, due to poorly trained staff, our waiter couldn't remember who ordered what from the aperitif drinks to the deserts. We ordered a 150$ red wine bottle but they couldn't serve it in proper red wine glasses (we had some kind of enhanced water or white wine glasses instead). Salad was over vinegared and when finally the meat came, we were relieved because it was the only enchantment of our dinner, quickly spoiled as the staff told us that there will be no free flow of salad, while it was very clearly written on the menu (they called it a misunderstanding!) Last, avoid the brownie for desert, it had barely no chocolate taste, was served with a very average industrial vanilla ice cream, and was way over cooked. "
French,Paul,Nice brunch with very good breakfast options and good French sandwiches,positive,40,10-Nov-15,Very good sandwiches and breakfast options including eggs and coffee. Sandwiches and salads are fresh and service was very good. Found it to be a bit pricey though for the quality of food.
French,Paul,Extremely poor service,negative,10,25-Nov-17,"Don’t understand why people queue up to have lunch at this place. The food is ok, but nothing special. The staff is terrible. Slow, incompetent and unfriendly. Something must be wrong with their facial muscles as they seem incapable of smiling. I waited 15 minutes before someone took my order. I had to draw the attention of the waiting staff three times. As I got seated the people at the table next to me asked for their bill. They repeated that request several times. Their bill came after somebody took my order, i.e. they waited at least 15 minutes. They subsequently had to wait another 10 minutes for their change. That’s 25 minutes to settle the bill! The people at the table in front of me went through the same ordeal to try to order some food. They gave up and left.The restaurant is dirty. I was seated next to a wall which is completely coffee stained. Avoid this place at all cost!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Exquisite Dim Sum,positive,50,11/30/12,"To make this clear, the dim sum my family and I ate was at Crystal Jade Golden Palace Restaurant at Paragon (shopping centre) in Orchard Road. Today is the third time we've been here and it's never disappointed.The service is always good - they serve the food fast, clear the empty plates etc fast and your teapot gets refilled regularly. Speaking Mandarin helps since the servers' Mandarin proficiency is way higher than that of their English!Now...the FOOD:The Paos - the BBQ Pork Bun and the Custard Bao have very soft flour that melts in your mouth. The pork is tender and not too salty, but the best part is they got the balance of flour and meat just right. Though the custard pao is just as good, I still prefer the ones from The Cathay at Cathay (which is also along Orchard Road) because the filling has more of an egg taste.Ha Kau - the prawns are fresh and juicy; the flour is not too thick, is smooth and soft.Pan-fried carrot cake - I don't usually like carrot cake, but the way it's cooked doesn't make it too oily. It's just a little burnt, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Panda sweet potato paos - well because of Kai Kai and Jia Jia they have this. The buns look cute but my mum felt the sweet potato wasn't sweet enough. (What an irony.) I thought there was too much flour. It was ok overall.Chee chiong fan - the flour is really smooth and it can glide on your tongue! We've tried the prawn, pork and beef versions and they all taste good. (Plus I really like drinking the soy sauce.) The flour here is awesome!Mashed taro with pumpkin or more fondly known as Or Nee! - I've saved the best for last. This was the best or nee I've ever eaten because the yam paste was amazingly smooth and creamy (but not too thick) and the pumpkin pieces just collapse in your mouth when you chomp down on them. Yam affectionados, this is for you."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best indian meal of my life till now,positive,50,13-Jan-14,have been to many resturants all over India but the taste of food i had at Kailash Parbat in Singapore is the best till now

French,Saveur,"So-so, below expectations",negative,30,8-Oct-17,Have eaten at other outlets so this outlet is really pale in comparison. Signature duck confit was cold and disappointing. Seabass was fishy and not fresh. Truffle fries was alright though.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One manageress spoilt our dining experience.,negative,30,07/30/11,"Dined here several times & had enjoyed most of the time except for this particular manageress, Madalene, who was rude to the core & deliberately pick a fight with customers.Without the ugly encounter with her, I would have rated this restauarant as ""Excellent"". Apparently, when we returned next round the management did nothing to her even after giving valuable feedbacks. Otherwise, i find the food 'great', waiting service by other staff 'good', ambience 'very spacious & high ceilings', price is on the high end. Would i go back, the ugly encounter is a phobia unless the management take actions on Madalene's rotten attitude."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,London duck,negative,10,4/10/2016,So so only. I can confirm it is not even near the look and taste on London roasted duck. Quite disappointed
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Actually reasonable value for money,positive,40,12/16/16,"We went to the Long Beach Seafood branch at Dempsey this week. The food was surprisingly reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Pepper crab was S$63 per kilo and beers were just over S$7 each (330ml cans of Heineken). The total bill for 3 persons with more than enough to eat was around S$220. Really not bad. The service was decent, and the waitress cautioned us against ordering too much instead of pushing extra on us. Atmosphere isn't fabulous but it's OK. Probably a much better deal than the tourist traps along Clarke Quay or Boat Quay."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food!! Service was fast too!,positive,40,2-Oct-16,Food was great especially the sashimi. Service was very fast though the restaurant was full. Will come back again!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",best sushi/sashimi ex japan,positive,50,19-May-12,simply the best I've had outside Japan. a massive wallet destroying exercise but umami to the max.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",average food,negative,30,28-Aug-17,"average food. would rather visit hokkaido sushi at hotel M for the same price but definitely better standard. service was great, dishes were served quickly without having to wait for long and empty plates were cleared promptly as well."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Value for money,positive,40,11-Apr-13,"Spricy Punjabi restaurant, with good varieties of Punjabi cuisine. We enjoyed our dinner, with chilled beer, sitting close to the river. Service is good. Decently priced menu. Nice ambience and tasty Punjabi food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Staff Service & Food portion at UE Square,negative,30,2-Nov-17,The foods are delicious but portion of the food for each order for the ala carte buffet is too small. The staffs are not proactive to provide spoons & wasabi when soup and sushi are served. Have to ask for wasabi twice before it was served.Servers are chinese speaking. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Poor service, decent food",negative,20,24-Sep-17,"Made the mistake of stopping by at this location. While the food is fine, I would recommend going to their other location on Serangoon Rd. Much better ambience and service. We always go there with friends. At the Syed Alwi outlet, they first gave me a table and then made me move because “the group wants this table.” Turns out they wanted to give my table to five tourists. Don’t think I will be going back to this location ever again. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Consistent ,positive,50,21-Sep-18,"You can never go wrong here. Always fresh, always friendly and excellent service. Michelin rated Chef."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good ,positive,40,19-Feb-16,Very good food. Very friendly staff. Worth visiting if you are a vegetarian. Located near Mustafa and easily approachable.
French,Paul,Over rated and bad service,negative,10,9-Dec-17,"Like most of the restaurant and the trends in our customer service. Paul at Ngee Ann City has continued to meet the expectation of the “I don’t really care” attitude. Waiting to be seated we were not shown to the table so we were wondering should we wait or..?We go head on our own and when we seated down the waiter just lightly throw the menu. When I asked what’s the soup of the day.. er.. I don’t know I need to check. So a clear first sign you are not ready for that day when the cafe open. I wonder if he know when is his pay day?When the soup and 1st main came just lay on the table without asking who is having which dish. So simple. The staff is one of the experience of what I believe your restaurant or cafe trying to bring to your patrons. No passion, the “I don’t care” attitude is not uncommon here. So cheap is not good and good won’t be cheap. But if one’s passion for what he is doing is measure by the value then honestly that what does this world deserve that person then?I notice no eye contact when they engage with the customer. Well here’s why some overseas brand didn’t survived in Singapore. Not just because the increasing rental but the attitude of the staff. Oh by the way, the attitude to Caucasian customers seems different though. Didn’t know Paul has such practises."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food,negative,30,29-Dec-16,Food was good but not wow. Cube roll was a bit over cooked. Seafood dishes were nice and yummy. Service was decent.
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and snacks ,negative,30,8-Mar-16,"Located on the 3 rd level of Ngee Ann City .
Good place to rest and relax after shopping
Service is prompt
Coffee is nice
Nice ambience
Like any other places in Singapore for coffee and snacks"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,positive,50,10/26/13,"My GF and I had the lunchtime all you can eat Dim Sum, they have a great trolley (several in fact) and also a la carte, you can pick and choose from both.Staff were very friendly constantly bringing more dishes.Best Dim Sum I've had, including places in China and London!It's tucked away upstairs but quite easy to find.."
French,Paul,Poor food and Shocking Service,negative,10,4-Jan-16,"My wife and I are visiting Singapore to visit family and today chose this outwardly appealing venue for lunch today. It was without doubt the worst mistake we have ever made concerning restaurants in the many years we have been visiting Singapore as the food and service was bad and bordering on Shocking!!Apart from having to wait at least 10 minutes to select a dish, when the meals were served they came up to the table - not together as you would expect but separate with a fair time between each dish being served which made it hard to dine together as we intended.We ordered two seafood salads plus simple dishes of cheese & salad bagette and a meat platter and although the dishes were edible they were far from the standard we were expecting. For example the salds were swimming in viniagette, there was no dressing on the Bagette's salad and the meat platter was smothered in onion (far too much).When it came to personal service..it was literally non-existant even though there seems to be plenty of staff 'running around in circles' achieving very little.The only thing that arrived at the table was the bill and to cap it all they had the audacity to add 10% Service Charge' God know what for.Given our experience today I would advise anyone to steer clear of Pauls in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi is fresh and good. Unagi Don was good too.,positive,40,5-Jun-16,Will definitely go back again. Ordering are all through TAB which makes it very easy. But it will be good if there's exact photo of each item.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tourist Trap - staffs asked additional money for fixed price menu !,negative,20,09/14/14,"I went to this restaurant with my wife on 12/9 . (Table 18 ) we ordered a fixed price menu S$ 138 for 2 persons . We were told by waitress Ms Liao Gun Hui that fixed menu crab is usual weighted 1 Kg but tonight no 1 Kg crab is available . We were told to pay additional S$ 30 for a bigger crab which weighted 1.2Kg . I refused and talked to the Service Manager . She immediately apologized and told us 1 Kg crabs just arrived at the restaurant and is now available at no extra cost . All happened within 3 minutes ! I suggested to the manager to remove the fixed price menu because it is not right for waitress to increase fixed price menu as she likes. I certainly would not pay extra $10 in McDonald for a fixed price meal. Be careful with this restaurant . For me , I will not go back to Long Beach because there are plenty of good and honest restaurants in Singapore . "

The bread is so delicious! ! W hen we there the place was busy, and the service was very poor and the staff lost in place ..so sad !!I'm normally calm and friendly to other people, I have to confess I lost my cool side many times ...Looking forward to another visit and im hoping for a better service. .."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Charges for onions seperatly. Avg exprnce. ,negative,20,2-Jul-15,A very average experience. They serve good quality food with a very low quality of service. The food is a bit over priced and they even charge for onion seperatly. The waiters are not warm and welcoming during the serve. Whereas the other indian restrnts in the neigbhrhood are much better. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious hawker foods at good prices and location!,positive,40,23-May-11,"Although some locals do not recommend this hawker centre because it's touristy or a little bit more pricey than other hawker centres, I really like Newton Hawker Centre!Newtown Hawker Centre has a great variety of delicious local foods at cheap prices and it opens until very late. Because I always stay around Newton/Novena area whilst in Singapore, this place is handy for me. Especially sometimes I only stopover in Singapore for 1-2 days only and I always come by here and then I'd check out Mustafa 24 hour shopping centre afterwards since it's quite close.Do not worry about the vendors wanting you to buy foods at their stalls, and take your time looking around at places you fancy. Also, do not be fooled by the stall's owners. Once, my partner was tricked into buying this jumbo prawns (they're really huge because they're bigger that your computer mouse!) and they're really expensive and not worth it. Also, remember to look for A-grade stalls (they will have big A. B, C rated) for the cleanest stalls."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Hawker Food,positive,50,15-Mar-12,"So many great foods all crammed into one exciting area only 1 MRT stop from Orchard Road! Chilli Crab, Fried Carrot Cake and Chicken Wings are just some of the great food you will find in this multi cultural arena."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Superb meal outside India in Singaproe,positive,50,6-Dec-13,"Excellent food with authentic Indian flavour after home in Singapore!!
Totally sinful if you miss Butter paneer, Naan, Pulao, Butter chicken and last but not the least Dal Makhani. Total value for money"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dated!,negative,10,03/13/16,1st bottle of wine....not available....2nd not also...third time lucky. All the plastic chairs are dirty. Not what I expected from an apparently first class seafood restaurant. Very dated.....the people who own this restaurant need to think about the mouse analogy. Going back for the same piece of cheese that is not there. Could be so much better. Absolute rip off. Ordered a margarita and it was pathetic! How much do you want to cheat people. Great setting.....but crap.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Pepper Crab, amazing !!!",positive,50,05/29/16,"Great food, fast service. A must for any traveller to Singapore. The seafood is excellent and a nice setting at Dempsey Hill"
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur Cathay,positive,40,16-Jan-17,"I pop by many Saturdays after a long day which ends in church opposite. In a sense the laid back atmosphere is a plus when you want good food in a hurry. Recently they started the set dinner menu which is good value for money. Today I had the foie gras with grapefruit, a generous serving and the grapefruit a nice counterpoint to a nicely seared liver. The beef short rib braised with red wine was a fairly small portion for me but melt in the mouth tender. Desert of the day was to be chocolate tart which they replaced with vanilla ice cream but where nice enough to change to a refreshing lemon vinigrette salad dotted with olives and hazelnuts which was good with the heavier meat I had chosen. All-in-all a good meal for $29++ so yes I came back again! "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday lunch ,positive,50,04/22/17,"We have our birthday lunch at peach blossoms the buffet lunch is really nice good food and the service staff is very friendly and attractive thank to Christina ,Nobel ,terry ,bowie ,Mun Fung ,sun jing will see you'll again "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab is the Best in town!,positive,50,6/1/2012,"We headed over to Dempsey Hill for some famous Singaporean Crab. Dempsey Hill is basically a village of sorts filled with restaurants, a few bars, and some shops catering to expats. We heard that the Long Beach Restaurant served up “the original and the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore”. How could we go wrong? We ordered that along with a couple side dishes. Their Black Pepper Crab was phenomenal!! So spicy, so messy, and perfectly proportioned! I highly recommend this place. http://www.internationalnabers.com/2012/05/25/great-beers-found-in-singapore/"
French,Paul,Great service!,positive,50,17-Apr-18,I am very pleased with the service that was provided at Taka. The staff was very prompt and helpful in helping me with my selections. Had a every pleasant experience and will definitely dine here again. Thank you!
French,Angelina_MBS,Nice chocolate,negative,30,17-Sep-17,Nice hot Chocolatiers drinks that can share but it's thick and rich and very hard to finish alone and expensive
French,Angelina_MBS,All that hot choco goodness,positive,40,17-Jan-16,"It's that hot chocolate that would be worth going back to again and again. Thick, comforting, at the right temperature to sip without the singe, cacao wafts soothingly. Didn't add the cream but just ate it straight as if it were a dessert -- it was good cream on its own! Wary of the chestnut dessert as it was too sweet. Very accommodating staff on a weekend considering I had three extra guests on top of my original reservation for four. Staff even reassigned us to a nicer spot. "
French,Saveur,"Average, Mediocre",negative,30,2-Jan-18,The overall food quality is average. Mushroom Risotto is good. Appetisers such as Truffle- fries is below average.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Does what it says! French steak and chips!,positive,40,23-Sep-17,"Not sure why this place gets low ratings. You can see that it serves steak and chips with a lovely sauce and lots of lovely wines sitting outside in cool Duxton Hill.Service was pretty good, nice place to chill and relax and do some business."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,40,25-Jun-18,This place is located very near to the Mustafa Shopping Centre . It caters to excellent Indian food with very authentic taste and aroma. The North Indian dishes are a must try. Service is also decent.
French,Saveur,Only duck confit is worth it,negative,30,20-Jan-17,10% vouchers not usable with set meals. So the vouchers are not worth it. Duck confit is really good! But the rest are average only. Staff did not even inform us that plain water is 30 cents and assumed we all want it.
French,Poulet,Yummy! Value for money!,positive,40,22-Oct-13,"We had their signature chicken dish and it was tasty! The price is reasonable for such delicious French cuisine. The lamb stew was delicious as well, very soft and nicely cooked. The crews are friendly and fast. Overall it was a good experience. Will definitely visit again."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinatown Restaurant,positive,40,01/27/13,"I wrote in my book, BBQ Port Bun - OMG! Perfectly cooked garlic softshell crab. Pan fried pork pancake, really good, fragrant, not like pancake we think of in the states! Great energy at this restaurant. Not supergreat customer service but I would go back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"For occasions, occasinally",positive,40,11/7/2017,"Iconic food does not come cheap in Singapore. At least not crab and seafood.But if you must try crab done Sg style, then there's only Long Beach and Jumbo, cos these are the two popular places to try crab. Some may also include No Signboard and Eng Seng, or some zichar palace at your HDB void deck. But really, when it comes to iconic and signature, only Long Beach and Jumbo should be considered, for tourists and guests from overseas. (cos if you're trublu local, you will either diy at home, which is not difficult; or you will know of some joint somewhere offering cheaper, and perhaps better alternatives)."
French,Paul,"Good dishes, although portions could be bigger for the price we pay",negative,30,24-Mar-15,"We have been to several of their locations in SG and worldwide. In Singapore, their locations are nice, and the dishes quite varied and tasty. The only downside is that you pay the same price, if not more, for typical French items (croque-monsieur or crèpe complète for ex) as you do in a real French restaurant in Singapore. So since this is actually a bistro type of place, their prices should be cheaper."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Improved service,positive,50,28-Nov-16,Better service than last visit in jul. Staff were diligent in clearing plates & all food items were served. Some items were still salty but that's the usual
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Pretty good,positive,40,07/22/15,"Was recommended by my uncle to try this place and was pleasantly surprised. The black pepper duck bun was very good and the cha siu was original tasting. Slight complaint would be the duck...very fatty and if that's what you like, then there should be no problem. Overall a simple and good lunch experience and would definitely recommend to others."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Veg Restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,5-Feb-18,"One of the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.They have excellent food, excellent service with warm welcoming staff. In our 20 days stay in Singapore we ate at this restaurant for 10 days. Their Kaju masala curry, grilled sandwiches and malai kulfi were the best ones we ever had."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but very noisy,positive,40,10/9/2012,"The food was good. Service so so only. However the atmosphere wasn't good as it was like a market, simply too noisy. It is always with long queue and if you really want to go, remember to make reservation one or two days in advance. And reservation is very strict, cannot be late. Suggest to let customers fill up the menu slip on what they want to eat rather than pushing the carts around because the restaruant itself is not spacious enough. The restaurant sign board is not easily seen along the road. If you are driving, the parking is not cheap, $1 per half an hour."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Old Style Singapore Seafood - the Best,positive,50,02/17/14,I've been a follower of this Long Beach branch since its heydays at Marina South. I will not go to another restaurant for seafood unless I have no choice. Their signature dish is the black pepper and chili crab. Their latest creation of soft and crispy hor fun is great.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and fries!,positive,50,14-Aug-18,"My husband and I have been here quite a few times, and the steak and fries is always excellent, and the sauce is the best! So we decided to go back on short notice last weekend. We forgot how good it is.. the steak is always very tender and the fries are crispy. If you order the regular portion, you get a few pieces of meat with lots of fries. Then when you manage to finish, you get more meat and more fries! For $35 (I think) this is just amazing. also, you get a salad with walnuts as a starter, and that's included in the price too. My husband always goes for the XXL portion, which is HUGE, but he somehow manages to finish it, this one is $55 I think. We love love love the place and will be back again soon!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't go. Period.,negative,10,18-Apr-17,"Bad food, bad service, terrible coordination between delivery orders and live orders. Waiters did not speak English."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Quality food and excellent service,positive,50,10/22/16,"This is a place where we still like to patronise after a couple of years because of its quality food like Peking duck and Claypot salted fish with doufu and chicken. Also, the staff are attentive, especially Terry and Mun Fong. "
French,Poulet,French style food,positive,40,14-Feb-14,"The food here is what I would call ' version"" of French food and not bad at all, whilst not being fancy at all. French style roast chicken is the signature dish here.The menu is neither extensive nor sophisticated but there is plenty to choose from and I was pleased with the choice.Portions are small-ish but I prefer it that way -- and for the price I paid this was a well cooked, tasty meal at a good price, in a pleasant little restaurant."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",really good food,positive,50,19-May-18,"the staff were good and helpful as well. sweets are also good. north Indian food is best, chats can be avoided"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Dim sum ok, don't bother with a la carte",negative,20,9/7/2017,We went on a busy bank holiday and were seated within 30mins. Not bad. The dim sum trollers were great and the food was nice. Problem started when we ordered a la carte. The sweet and sour pork was tasteless and sauce very greasy. We wondered if the pork was cooked thoroughly because it had a funny texture. A member of our group vomited after the meal so sure the pork was not cooked properly. The spicy Aubergine hotpot was not spicy and again lots of oil and cornstarch. Don't order a la carte there and stay away from pork.
French,Paul,Dreadful service.. not worth the wait,negative,20,9-Sep-17,"We came here on a Saturday evening and waited for at least 10m at the maitre'd when there were plenty of available seats. Waiters and Waitresses breezed by with sour expressions. After sitting down, reviewing the menu we asked to order and the waitress came to order. We ordered an all day breakfast, a sandwich and fries. The lady said she would check on whether the sandwich was available and let us know if it wasn't. After 30m, after the breakfast was eaten we asked for the sandwich. She told us that she forgot to tell us there were no more sandwiches, and she forgot to order the fries with the kitchen. We won't be back. It's just not worth it. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Best value steak in Singapore,positive,50,11-Feb-14,"We've been to the Duxton branch twice now and if steak frites is your thing it's well worth it. As the name implies, there's only one main course, entrecote either a large or very large portion with ""free flow"" fries and a green salad. On both occasions the steak has been cooked exactly as we all liked it and service is polite and attentive.There's a good choice of French starters and desserts. We've enjoyed the starters, I've gone for the snails both times, such that he staff remembered the second time. We've never got as far as the desserts. Wine choice is good though we've only ever had the house red and white, which has been good value.The bistro decor all adds up to the Parisien feel, even if we are 6,000 miles away. Well worth it compared to some much more expensive options."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,40,29-Jun-15,"Good :
We ordered Indian/Chinese here and all the items very good. All staff is Indian and served us in very professional manner
Bad:
Very expensive"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",my dinning experience,positive,50,6-May-14,dahi papdi chat and the pani puri served in Singapore branch was at par with any other branches in india. Chass served here is also great and reminds you that whether you are having your dinner in India or singapore.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fried oyster omelette,positive,40,17-Dec-17,Nice food. Too less variety. Most of the are selling the same food. Fried oyster omelette and Satay from stall 73 and stall 76 meat try.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good for sea food,positive,40,01/18/15,"Recommended for sea food lovers, others find some other place. Crab is the specialty, prawns were good, rice and tofu okay. In January the weather holding, outdoor ambiance is great."
French,Saveur,"Great taste, but Small Portions",negative,20,1-May-17,Got the chilli crab pasta - taste was great but the portion is so small and not even worth the promotional price. Pity as the taste was quite good.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Our experience ,negative,20,21-Dec-16,"The food in the restaurant is good but way too pricey for the quality of service they have. For the shrimp sashimi chef showed us dead and old shrimps saying that they are fresh and joking that they are ""sleeping"". We asked to replace them for fresh ones, however chef just pretended that he changed them, apparently thinking that we are fools. In the meantime, we have been to Nobu, Zuma snd other upscale restaurants which serve japanese/fusion food. We asked him again to change the shrimps and he replied that it is our fault because we got late for our sitting (the sitting was at 9 and we came there by 9:15). Later, we asked to replace this shrimp sashimi for other sushi, and the restaurant included it in the bill as ""extra"". The last and final was the desert (fruit) which was half portion in comparison to what the other customers got, who ordered the same set. Apparently it was also because we got 15 min late. Altogether we paid 750 SGD. No comments. "
French,Saveur,Saveur sans douleur ,positive,40,16-Apr-18,"Very good food for a fraction of the price at expat-run restaurants (and we’re not talking about the top ones!) Chili crab squid ink pasta is delicious and innovative. Don’t know how they do it, as rent is not low and they use expensive ingredients from Huber’s Butchers. OK, ambience and service are not as sophisticated as Odette’s or Robuchon’s, but you come here mainly for the food lah!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakase tepanyaki,positive,50,18-Oct-14,"It's very delicious, very simple, and only omakase. Reservation is tough though.. Very difficult but it's worth every penny. The appetizer is good, the Sea urchin appetizer is excellent, one of the signature dish. Everything is awesome."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious!,positive,50,08/14/16,"We requested Master Chef Francis CHong to arrange a menu for 6 of us. The dishes he arranged were fantastic, good portions, tasty, impressive presentation and most of all, all my grusts showed a ""thumbs-up"" for the whole meal. Master Chef Francis is indeed an expert in chinese cuisine, not only on taste, but also not forgetting the chinese cuisine traditional culture. Will definitely recommend more friends to go to Peach Blossom for delicious Chinese Cuisine by Master Chef Francis Chong."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh, fast service (mostly)",positive,40,19-Mar-17,"We were looking for a buffet place that features Japanese dishes, and decided to try this place after reading other positive reviews.The place was apparently quite popular, as it got crowded quickly.They offer either a la carte or buffet here. You basically order your food using electronic tablets available at each table. The menu on the tablet shows not just names of the dishes but also pictures, serving size (which allows you to know how much of each dish you are actually getting), and explains what each dish was. Basically, you select the dish that you want, indicate the portions, add it to the order, and click send. The process was quite simple and smooth.In general, orders arrive soon after we submitted them; mostly within about 2-3 minutes. Some dishes though, might take longer. For reasons we could not figure out, our orders of gyoza took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Sometimes they do miss an order, and you have to check with them. We had dishes that didn't show up until we asked them about it. So diners will have to keep tab on what's been served and what's yet to be served.We found the sashimi and sushi to be fresh, and the food were tasty.One disappointing issue was that drinks were not included in the buffet; not even green tea or water. You have to pay for those.We found the service to be acceptable, generally prompt. Staff were also friendly.At about S$40 per person, we felt that the buffet price was reasonable, especially if you enjoy sashimi and order lots of those.Overall this was a place worth visiting."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Very good Sushi ,positive,50,23-Jul-16,I lived 5 years in Tokyo and this Place is definitely up to Par with good places in Tokyo. Highly recommended. Will go again.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food bad service,negative,20,09/17/16,"Lunched at Yum Cha today and while the food was tasty, service was terrible. Seemed only interested in having you eat what was available immediately on the cart rather than ordering anything else - even though on menu."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great Service from the Staff,positive,50,21-Nov-14,"The service is prompt and orderly. Other than been a picky foodie.
Personable service from Narayan. He demonstrated it through a happy smile and is very polite, asking how the food is and he asked if I need additional serving of vegetables. and he is...More"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Feedback on Food & Service,positive,40,1/9/2014,"First of all, I need to highlight that items that I ordered are all in Individual portion. Food is served in per plate per pax. I was puzzled that presentation and serving of food was all served together! First came my soup, Almond with Fish Maw Soup very quickly follow by appetiser Soft Shell Crab w Salted Egg which is fine. Quite immediately after appetiser is served came Peking Duck with Foie Gras, by which time we were struggling to drink the soup, eat the crab and Peking Dark. And the rest of dishes follow suit. When Wagyu Beef with Longan arrive, I was quite annoyed and displeased and told the server to please hold the dishes till we are almost done with at least 70% of what is on the Table. As by which time there are about 8 plates for 2 diners.The last dish Seasonal Veg with Abalone was still served immediately despite my my request to hold dishes till we clear the table.Being Chinese myself, I understand if I order the dishes as a whole plate to share...it's definitely fine to serve few dishes all at one go.But with an individual pax serving..I think the server should have an eye for details ie. be prepared or standby the kitchen when guests is almost done with one of the dish before you present the next. I think it's a normal dining standards for restaurants like Peach Blossom. . The manager who took our order was friendly and cheerful. But the Service staff were kinda impatient...giving that can you help to make way for these plates I'm holding??!!! Service standard was not exactly good as compare to food standard.The bill was $230 for 2 pax. It wasn't exactly a good dining experience."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really disappointed,negative,20,12-Jun-15,we are really sorry for Mr Tetsuya but this restaurant is nothing compared with the one in Sydney. It was good seeing him at the restaurant welcoming the guests.It all started very well with the display of fresh sea food to be served followed by the sea urchin signature dish but that was it. The portion size were very small to the ridiculous size of the Tasmanian cape grind steak to close with a bland consommé containing white rice and poached fish. We really expected more for S$1100 for two people.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili Crab is the winner,positive,50,12/9/2016,"Its interesting to read the extremes of reviews for this place. I really liked it. Having visited Singapore a few times, I haven't yet found a better chili crab - I guess for my taste. The black pepper crab isn't as good as I have found elsewhere, but I go here to sit outside and eat crab, sauce and buns. It simply doesn't get any more complicated than that. I've not noticed the prices being particularly high and the service is invisible - its just about the chili crab."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great location. Acceptable Food. Terrible Service. Stressful Ambience,negative,20,01/19/14,"Located right in the heart China Town, this is a great location to bring visitors for a Dim Sum breakfast, but do not expect to be serviced, even though they charge 10% service fees. And be prepared for the noise and crowd of hungry (angry) people - on Sunday morning! We waited for more than 15 minutes without any dim sum trolly passing by, we indicated to the staff three times that we would like to have some dim sum. Unfortunately, all three of them ignore our requests separately. Everyone seems too busy to care or to talk to customers. Finally, after 20 minutes (it seems much longer when you are hungry), one of the trollies with steamed Dim Sum stop by. The lady in-charged of the trolly was attending to two other customers appeared from nowhere, despite acknowledging our existence. We literately have to 'fight' for her attention. There was no vinegar, ginger and soya sauce on the table, we have to grab it elsewhere ourselves. Another interesting thing is being charged for pickle or peanut which was not on the table, and we did not order. We paid S$22 per head for a stressful Sunday morning breakfast. I used to like the food here, but I will give it a miss after this torturious experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Really disappointing,negative,20,6/1/2017,"It was the start of a six week holiday and we were so looking forward to a great first night extravanganza meal.Regrettably we were so disappointed. The restaurant was only 25% full and that should have alerted me that it is no longer popular.We chose the Set Dinner for $S62. The portions were tiny, lacked imagination and flavour. The duck entree had two tiny slivers of duck, the prawn and and scallop dish had one prawn and one scallop. The main of honey infused lamb loin had two sugar cube size portions of fatty lamb. The fried cod in a BBQ sauce was nice. With a bottle of wine the cost for two was $S290. Maybe the entry level menu did not showcase the gourmet offerings that might be available from the more expensive set menu options, but the food we were presented with sure wouldn't encourage us to want to venture back and pay even more money.The week before we had just enjoyed an entry level set menu experience at China Doll in Sydney for a similiar price and that meal was just fantastic. Every course was delicous."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Clean place,negative,30,20-Feb-17,"We ordered shrimps, fish curry, goat meat, okra and chicken. Only the okra was excellent. The rest seem to be all the same curry base.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Still prefer Sushi Kanesaka in Tokyo,positive,40,2-Aug-13,"Having been to their main restaurant (Sushi Kanesaka) in Tokyo twice, I really wanted to like Shinji in Singapore. We went to Shinji for lunch (got the Tsuki set lunch for S$125 per person). For some reason, we were not wowed. Don't get me wrong. They serve very good sushi, and from what we learned, everything served came from Japan (flown into Singapore four times a week). Perhaps we were comparing the meal with the dinners at Sushi Kanesaka (which included more variety than lunch), but I would rate this as a ""Very Good"", not ""Excellent"".Having said that, this is still a good dining option if you are looking to eat high quality sushi in Singapore. We were fortunate to be served by Oshino-san (Kanesaka-san's second-in-command) who was very friendly and made us feel right at home."
French,Paul,French Afternoon Delight...A Quaint French Bakery in the heart of Singapore,positive,50,30-Sep-14,"Was wondering where to have a quiet and interesting afternoon tea when we stumbled upon this French bakery. Fresh French breads, tarts, baquettes, macaroons & cakes...for a weekday afternoon, it's almost full house. Everyone seem to have something interesting on their table. Menu looks interesting with different salad, appetizers, sandwiches with your choice of bread, croissants. It was hard to choose as everything looked interesting. We settled for an afternoon tea set that comprises of a cappuccino/latte, 2 mini macaroons (lemon & caramel), a mini creme brûlée & a chocolate cake. This set costs a decent $12. I wanted a scrumptious looking lemon raspberry sponge cake (Moelleux citron framboise-$7.40), however it was sold out. French jazz was played in the background with crystal chandelier on the ceiling..we had a corner table that overlooks the busy Orchard road..Overall, it was a great time spent with a scrumptious afternoon tea."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome food and service!!!,positive,50,10/3/2018,"I was here on July for my uncle’s 60th birthday celebration, and I was really impressed with my dining experience here!Made a reservation via email, and the reservations team was really attentive and helpful to attend to my requests. My Uncle liked yam in general and they gave us really good yam based food recommendations.What’s really awesome was that I had requested for peach (lotus bun) for my Uncle and they really prepared it for him. The decorations for the peach was beautiful - and it’s complimentary :) Service is really great!Food wise, it was really delicious! Some food recommendations that I have here are:- trio meat ( roasted meat, pork belly and duck meat). Really tasty and I could taste the charred flavours of the meat!- crab fried rice was really yummy as well! Fresh and good - their yam based food is really good too!- fish was great as wellOverall, a great experience! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Love the fresh buffet!,positive,50,7-Feb-15,"The food was fresh. The service prompt and friendly. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening (reservation) and then ordered through iPads. The food came quick, and quite fresh. I love salmon and the salmon here was very good, with just the right amount of fat. We also had the cheese scallop which was very good and recommended. I also like the atmosphere here which is very home-y and ""uncorporate"" feel which is good. Overall the value for this place is excellent! "
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Yummy!,positive,40,14-Jan-17,"We went here for a yummy south Indian breakfast. Idli, pongal, dosai... Tastes, service very authentic. Strongly recommended. Won't break your budget either."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not a good place for hawker food,negative,20,17-Mar-14,"Same food everywhere, and not impressive. They are just not delicious. Good thing about Singapore hawker centres are they are very clean, but I dislike them using many non-recyclable materials, which in long term it is bad for the environment."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Excellent, very popular",positive,50,6-Sep-15,"Went for Saturday lunch with family and experience was good. Place seems very popular with families and restaurant was almost full.Service was prompt and staff courteous and accommodating with smiles. Or starters we ordered pani poori a typical north indian dish and it was fresh and tasty.Main course was Cheese and normal bhatoore (bread) with chick peas which is most popular dish at Kailash parbat. Schezwan noodles, Dal makhni and rice.All food were fresh, good portion size and tasty.For desert, we had Malai rabri and it was authentic.Cant fault either service or food.

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Our weekend hangout!,positive,40,2-Jun-15,We are found at Murugan every Sunday morning for breakfast! I love their idlis and pongal.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent & Fresh Sushi served,positive,50,4-Jan-17,Went during 1st Jan. food served is fresh and fast. Atmosphere is average. Waiters are polite and prompt in what you requested for.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Steak and Fries,positive,40,3-Sep-16,"I found a listing for E'ntrecote at Duxton Hill in the Singapore Good Food Guide, and decided to try it out. Quite a few bars and restaurants in the pedestrianised part of Duxton Hill. I live in Singapore but I wasn't aware of these fine restaurants until the other evening.Arrived by taxi and walked up the pedestrianised section until I reached the restaurant. Midweek and very few diners so got a table easily. Nice albeit narrow - we were seated near to the air conditioning. Ordered snails for starters - fantastic - full of garlic and most flavoursome. For the main event I ordered steak - it was medium well cooked, and came with French Fries - just as I ordered. Whilst I have nothing but praise for the food I was served, my colleague was less impressed with her order of mussels. The mussels were incredibly small - they were European and not the New Zealand version which are often served in restaurants. Had I ordered them I would have been unhappy too, so keep away from the mussels. For dessert I ordered cream caramel - again that was a wonderful choice.I called in advance to reserve a table and was told that it was not possible, however it is possible to reserve via the Trip Advisor app - which worked well. Free wifi, good service and nice ambiance. Certainly an enjoyably meal.Turn left outside the restaurant and walk down the hill through the car park and you will find a ready supply of taxis. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Stunning,positive,50,30-Sep-16,"Absolute fantastic sushi, prepared and beautifully presented by knowledgeable, dedicated experts. Not cheap - but the quality justifies the price."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing food variety,positive,50,16-Jan-17,A short distance walk from our hotel at Grand Hyatt. Wide variety of food to choose for and still very reasonable price with the new government tightening the pricing to attract tourists. I would recommend here if you want to try variety of Singaporean food.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I love it!,positive,40,5/5/2014,The food and the service is great. The black pepper/chilli crab is delicious. I visit this institution almost every time we visit Singapore.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singaporean Cuisine,positive,40,18-Feb-16,"Having read about hawker centres we wanted to experience one and this was the closest to our hotel (walking distance) I read that all Singapore eateries are hygiene rated and whilst a hawker stall rarely if ever achieves A status there are plenty of B status to choose from. The food we chose was very very tasty and very very cheap, the most expensive thing was beer. Well worth a visit if you want to experience the real food of Singapore"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,positive,50,22-May-17,Food excellent as always. All is perfect. Except one order of mine (grilled wings) were forgotten . :(
French,Saveur,Food taste good,positive,40,5-Sep-16,"Had set dinner. The food tasted good. A little pricey but recommended for another visit.
You may or may not like their industrial interior. Open kitchen concept, so your clothes may get the food smell. Overall pleasant experience though"

After all these days of South Asian cuisine this is best. The price are quite more but worth it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pathetic and expensive food,negative,20,19-Sep-12,"This is pathetic restuarent and these guys are looting people in name of thier restaurent decoration. Only thier plate, table cloth and restaurent jhoomar(lighting) will attract you here.The quantity of serving plate food is too low and i feel the food was reheated food.I order bhel poori and i feel this was they pout maggi sous on it. No standard, not proper table service (very less staff in ratio, all serving staff passing ball to next if you ask something).IF YOU TRUST ME NEVER GO TO KAILASH PARBAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT TASTY AND REASONABLE RATE FOOD.I appriecite ""Kahansama"" who is just in front of this reastaurent for great taste and resonable rate."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh sashimi, nice BBQ",positive,50,9-Oct-16,Went there for quite a few times and the sashimi are all very fresh. The must tries are their BBQ though.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a fat duck with HK attitude,negative,30,1/9/2016,"It's an aircon eatery, your typical modern HK roasted meat shop in a mall. The service is something you need to manage your own expectations, do not expect well trained staff. You won't get patient introduction of each dish, or recommendations, you are quite expected to write down what you want on the menu paper and have little chit chat. That said, the duck is good, noodles decent, soup is the usual HK too salty type, wanton noodles, dim sum, etc are average. I would come back again, but not often. The food is decent for the price you pay. But that said, you can get very similar standard at any neighborhood coffee shop roasted meat delights stalls. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome chilli and pepper crab,positive,50,9/7/2013,"It is about 10 years since we left Singapore and moved to Europe, and we have missed the chilli crab and black pepper crab at Long Beach, their Dempsey location being new to us.We had a chance to revisit it tonight and it was wonderful.Peppery, tangy, buttery and spicy, rich flavours that cover your taste buds, hands and chin, with rice buns to soak up the sauce on the chilli crab, balanced with various Chinese greens and all washed down with a jug of Tiger beer ... Bliss !I specially brought a shirt of many colours to handle the inevitable splashes, but the staff kindly provided us with large bibs.Service was attentive and helpful, and the area which was the old army barracks when we lived here, has been transformed into a host of different restaurants and food types for all tastes and budgets.It was even better than we remembered."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Where guests become friends,positive,40,03/31/17,"The Husband (he has been given an upgrade) and I brought his family there for his father's birthday celebration. Expectedly, the food was flavourful and did not fail us. But what really got our notice was their service (or should I say, relationship) to their diners.Frequent diners, I assumed, were called by their first names. One service staff even remembered a diner's birthday had just passed.That weekend saw many diners celebrating their loved ones' birthdays. We heard a birthday rap done by a service staff and wondered if it was only for that table.Nope! We got a birthday specialty too - a birthday poem penned by the manager, with a figurine to boot. Apparently, Peach Blossom's assistant manager goes the extra mile by making these flour figurines for diners on his day off from work.Overall, it was an engaging and lovely dinner. Thank you Terry, Nobel, Bowei, Sook Teng, Akira, Mun Fang and of course, Christine for the warm service. See you again on 9/4/17 (i am so sold on their service that im bringing my family there soon).This is so not a paid advertisement!"
French,Saveur,Reasonable for price but not fantastic,negative,30,29-Oct-16,"Good to get the choke vouchers if you are making a booking through chops, that lets you save $5 from $50. The food is reasonable for its price but don't except high end French food. The foie gras could have been better though! The taste was a bit strong at times, and it didn't really melt in your mouth. The sea bass was also a bit too salty and fishy. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",A Great little Hotel in a fantastic Location with friendly staff,positive,50,27-Jun-15,"This was a special treat for my DAD for the special ""FATHERS DAY"".Everything is marvellous service, ambiance, and the excellent food.every single order is taking care By the young staff, every single Pinch of food is AMAZING,Really this Restaurant made our day a memorable one.I...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey and somewhat overwhelming,negative,30,5-Jun-18,"This hawker market is really more for tourists than locals and as such the prices are much higher than the markets locals would eat at.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Not as it used to be, but still, great 24 hour seafood place!",negative,30,30-Jun-15,"There's not as much selection of food as there used to be - more seafood but if that's what you're looking for, Newton Hawker Centre is great! Also, 24-hour Singaporean local food choice near town so very convenient for a late night snack!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,INCREDIBLE!!!! - food that is good to the last drop,positive,50,9/10/2016,"The food here was incredible - and well priced. There was not one dish that was not absolutely delicious. I couldn’t stop eating - which is rarely something that happens to me. But it was just SO GOOD. The atmosphere and service leave something to be desired. But with food that good, who cares?!? We walked in on a Thursday evening and got a table without a wait."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum in Singapore,positive,40,11/5/2012,"Great brunch place, a bit like Tapas but very Asian dishes.Nice ambiance, good service, could have been better if they were less stressed. Lots of dishes to choose from the menu and would actually advise if you've never had Dim Sum to go with someone local who knows what to order and maybe with a group. Eating alone is not much fun because the amount of the different dishes would be limited and expensive. Dim Sum is a meal you want to share with your family and friends, the more the merrier. Asians would normally order at least 10 different dishes and everybody share !!!Vegetarian food is available on the menu. Try the desserts too !! Enjoy !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Yumcha I have had!,positive,40,07/29/12,This is a feast not for the faint hearted. The pork buns are truly amazing! The sauce they use is so tasty. The service was lacking but lets be honest its all about the food! 3-5pm they do cheap Yumcha and we wish we had more time to go back again!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",FANTASTIC FOOD (We are brits who live round the corner from it and go all the time),positive,50,3-Apr-11,"This serves consistently tasty and very fresh seafood. Stingray, pepper crab and kang kong (green veg) are our must haves every time we come. Great value for money. Pick your own crab to get the size you want. You must try the laksa sold by the first hawker on the right as you go in the main entrance. The place is filled with locals every night. Plus a few expats like us."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Non existent service and terrible food,negative,10,05/17/15,"Do not bother to come here. Drives you crazy.
The food is not fresh. There is no one that speaks English well. Frustrating. If you sit further in the restaurant, the food trolley never comes to you."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Visitor,positive,50,08/21/15,"Average food and reasonably priced Place a bit drabby, could do with some refurbishment and upgrade of the whole area."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Rude, Sarcastic and Self ordering app that kept crashing ",negative,10,2-Aug-17,Cashier was poor in explaining use of Entertainer App and misled us to purchase the app usage instead of voucher for buffet. Subsequently accused us of non payment while being rude and sarcastic. Self ordering app in iPad kept crashing and we waited in vain for food that did not turn up. Reorders were made but not all the food arrived. 
French,Angelina_MBS,Mediocre Pastry Standards,negative,30,18-Jun-15,"The Citron Tarte's crust was slightly soggy, Le Mont Blanc's chestnut paste was too sweet and heavy. The taste and texture fail to balance even as we ate it with the cream under the blanket of chestnut paste.Bestie's iced chocolate was not smooth but my marron tea smells heavenly and was delicious.To be honest, I was disappointed because the two standard tarts that I go for didn't meet my expectations for this cafe."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Restaurant for good food, atmosphere and reasonable price",positive,50,06/19/14,"The look of the restaurant from outside is quite interesting including inside when you walk in. The seat is comfortable with varieties of foods to choose. I am during the abalone promotion with abalone set menu. I enjoy the taste of the food here. Furthermore, staffs are very friendly and help you with all the description of the food. I might suggest the soya chicken, abalone and soup.the price is quite reasonable compared with the food we ordered. This restaurant is quite highly recommended to visit."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good food and staff,positive,40,08/28/12,"We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for two nights and the restaurant was recommended online.The menu was varied and slightly confusing regarding cost per portion/person.The staff were very helpful in choosing, in serving and in attention to detail. The food was very good, some of the best scallops (chinese style) I have had. For a higher end restaurant with good service, the value was good."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",PARADISE FOR VEG LOVERS,positive,50,24-May-18,Entire singapore is full of non veg restaurant. It becomes difficult for veg lovers to find a good veg restaurant. Murugan idli shop is the place where you can give a treat to your tongue.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"awesome experience, but expensive",positive,40,8/8/2016,"wow, this was awesome. messy, spicy crab but so worth it. we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer. service was great. didn't seem like a touristy place at all. my only complaint is how expensive it is. the crab and all the sides we had were great, but I wish it could have been a more reasonable price. oh well, everything in SG is expensive. I'd go back."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Hmmm......not quite there !,negative,30,1-Sep-15,Went to the restaurant with 3 other friends.Chose to have their Wagyu steak which is supposedly their highlight. The steak was just OK. The meat was not as tender as expected and I found my self unable to chew the meat to the end which was not a pleasant experience.I like the price and the history of the place and hence would be willing to give it another go before I finally make up my mind.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Hawker Centre - overpriced,negative,30,10-May-12,"Reasonable food, but overpriced relative to other hawker centres in SG"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Food But Awful Service,negative,30,14-Oct-15,"Food Quality Was Okay not Awesome. The Price paid for the food was RIDICULOUSLY HIGHThe Service was a Nightmare, especially the way they bring food onto the table. When you go to a normal restaurant you will notice butlers / waiters bringing in food in a nice and clean tray, however in this restaurant you will notice a bunch of waiters / waitresses coming with a freaking attitude holding plates and bowls in dirty hands so here comes a question of hygiene. Not sure how other reviewers did not notice this. The lady who looked like an owner to me was polite enough to come and ask whether we received our food on time etc. but the overall experience at this restaurant was Awful. In addition to this, the area this restaurant is in, is the most horrible place.Will never every return here."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Excellent breakfast and veg.lunch,positive,40,1-Feb-15,"Very economical,clean,tasty food,both at Tekka center(Little India) and Changi airport.All varieties of Dosa,Idly ,Vada,Thali meal(Only veg.Meal),fruit juices etc.available.(And Dosa is a must to enjoy)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre - Just okay tourist trap,negative,30,15-Oct-12,We bring guests there when they come if it is a short visit - lots to eat in one location. But the stall hawkers can be really aggressive (for one who lives there) and the prices astonishing. Plus all of the high school aged kids drinking while still in school uniforms is off-putting
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration ,positive,50,08/28/17,"We celebrated a birthday occasion on the 27 Aug 2017. And I am sure is a memorable one. Christine and her staff had attends to us professionally with all our need and even made a small deity of longevity with the birthday cake to mark the occasion. It really brightens the ambience it is really beyond their duties. Thanks to Christine, Terry and staff that made our evening meaningful. "
French,Saveur,Good Concept but Average Execution,negative,30,14-Mar-17,"The restaurant had ample space and a good place to hang out with friends and family. They were sensitive to customers' needs. Like calling us and informing us that they had only very limited food left because of an earlier event. Although It was only 7pm. All 4 of us ordered the ribeye steak (all medium rare). The steaks were medium and not as juicy and succulent as what we expected. However, I must say they actually do try to deliver reasonably priced food"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not my idea of a good steak but may appeal to others,negative,30,12-Jun-14,"My French colleagues told me they quite liked this place so I went ahead and organised a group dinner there. As we were in great company with overseas visitors and old friends, we were able to have a good evening despite the shortcomings. I in particular (and a young visitor from Bangladesh who has been to France) did not quite appreciate the steak, neither the sauce. I heard some reviewers say that the steak was huge but mine was small, thin (cut in six slices) and bland on its own. I asked for the sauce to be served separately as I was told it has a rich sourish taste and did not want it drowning my steak in case I did not like it. True enough, it was too sourish (like yogurt sour) and very rich (probably a lot of butter). The French in our group were quite happy with the steak although only 2 (out of the 7 in the group) were offered second helpings. And we were not offered additional fries until most of us were quite done with our meals and the ones who wanted had to ask after more than 15 minutes into the meal. The 2 waitresses were very sombre looking and just did their work robotically with no warmth and no smile. The 2 waiters were a bit better, more trying to be efficient than being friendly. The desserts were good especially the Salty Butter Caramel Lava Cake although it was too sweet. The profiteroles were a tad dry probably from being in the fridge? The cost of the appetisers and the desserts were equivalent to those in hgher-end restaurants so in the end the bill still did amount to quite a lot. I guess on my part, this is not how I like to eat steak. Perhaps one needs to first appreciate and really like the sauce and opt to have the steak rare or medium so that the taste of the sauce is absorbed by the meat. Otherwise, this is not the place for you as there is only one main course option. And this restaurant advocates a 'no reservation policy' and they also will not give you a table until your whole group is present (or at least most of them)."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Food for Vegetarians,positive,50,12-Oct-17,Every dish we ordered was made to perfection and fulfilled our tasteful desires completely. we feel bad to not be able to complete our meal course because everything was so good and we ordered a lot.... i recommend do not leave this restaurant without having their desert.. specially malai kulfi
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food but below average service :(,negative,30,6/11/2017,"The food is good given the price paid! However, the service staff was unprofessional and rude.

I don't know, you tell me, I would expect better. Perhaps they need more manpower to run this. I need to commend on this hardworking spectacled server i observed though, he was trying to tend to the many customers as he could. Definitely need more manpower."

I love some of the maki rolls, Gyuniku Shogayak, Yakimono dishes. Surprised that they do not provide white vinegar for the gyoza. The tuna sashimi is very disappointing for its quality.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worst hawker centre in Singapore,negative,10,18-Jan-12,"This place is a tourist rip-off, there have been several incidents of people being charged hundreds of dollars for hawker food. Examples may be found in Tripadvisor reviews, as well as a search of past news stories. If you are cheated, you should file an official complaint with the Singapore Tourism Board, they have successfully taken one of the stalls at Newton to court before on behalf of a tourist who was cheated.If you want a good Hawker Centre experience try Chomp Chomp, Lau Pa Sat, Maxwell Road Food Centre, East Coast Park Food Centre, or just about any other hawker centre in Singapore for a more authentic experience and better food. Ask Singaporeans for recommendations, just about anyone will be willing to share their advice on this topic."
French,Saveur,Decent food for the price,negative,30,13-Dec-14,"They do dish up decent food for the price, especially in terms of presentation. The usual trade-off for the philosophy of good food at low prices is either quantity or quality. Concetto does well by its portions; however the quality is a little lacking for me.I tried the Grilled Octopus Caesar Salad, Buffalo Mozzarella, Beef Oyster Blade, and Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was amazing; everything else were subpar. I'm not expecting the world for their prices, but I do expect to have what I read on the menu. Concetto uses big words in their menu to mimic fine dining, but fail to deliver in the quality of their food.Good food does not need fancy ingredients. And with their Red Snapper I had a wonderful dish that used simple, fresh ingredients, combined with good cooking techniques. Stop playing with fancy names and instead use their culinary expertise to deliver delicious fine dining worthy food. I think that would make them really shine.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Concetto-by-Saveur/cmbz/F8F7B713-8333-4F47-A217-DF8074A26450"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food fast service,positive,50,30-Jul-18,Great value for money for vegetarian food. Ate for almost a month there and no stomach upset. Wholesome food and extensive menu to choose from
French,Paul,"Overpriced, crap service",negative,30,10-Dec-17,"I cannot fathom a restaurant which hires young serve staff who cannot communicate with the patrons. I had a frustrating few minutes with an inexperienced non speaking wait staff before u was attended on by what was obviously an older and more experienced staff. I waited inordinately long for cutlery and water. I had to remind various wait staff before I got my water. This marred my dining experience as service is so intrinsic to the dining process. I ordered a steak with two sides which cost $29. The steak was okay (not great). The side dishes were not particularly delectable. There was a long line waiting to come into the restaurant but the restaurant itself had many empty tables. There is work to be done on their seating process. All in all, not great. "
French,Paul,Busy at times average coffee,negative,30,23-Nov-16,"At times there are long queues, likely due to position and exposure. Nice layout area however the coffee taste average. Good place to park a moment in between shopping."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value but service could be better,positive,40,24-Feb-17,"The food is great but the staff are not very friendly or helpful if you are not local. Very busy so be prepared to wait for your order and book in advance, unlikely you will get in as a walk-in. Good location close to Boat Quay. Food is amazing and freshly prepared - hence the waiting times. Great value compared with Australian prices for sushi. All you can eat! Alcohol expensive. Tip - order a selection of hot and cold at same time as cold will come out faster!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible Experience,negative,10,6/6/2016,I received a confirmation email from Chope only to go to the restaurant on the day itself to find out that they never received the booking. It was a friend's birthday and there were 10 of us and of course the restaurant was not able to accommodate us. Had to scramble to find another place to go to. Better to call the restaurant directly instead of going through Chope.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Convenient Long Beach,positive,40,12/17/16,Long Beach seafood is one of the famous Singapore seafood chain. This one is located in the Dempsey park which makes it more convenient than the original on the south coast. Food is good and the location is nice. We enjoyed our chili and pepper crabs.
French,Poulet,Worth the try!,positive,40,28-Jun-14,It was my 1st french food experience Finally had the courage to give it a try at the Westgate outletStaffs was friendly and attentiveWaited about 20mins on a friday eveningThey took our order while waiting for our seat to be readyWe ordered1) Oxtail2) LambShank3) Their signature roast chicken4) Saute Mushroom5) Peach Clafoutis6) Apple TartThumbs up for all the dishes except I find the Lamb Shank abit tough but the Oxtail was my favoritePay slightly more than $80 for the above 6 itemsWill definitely go back again !

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best and fast seafood ,positive,50,12/25/15,"Freshly made seafood some even taken live from the tanks, fast service that brings you the food in twenty minutes even long taking food like crab. Surely one of the best seafood restraints in Singapore and I encourage them to put out more branches"
French,Saveur,Cody and Affordable,negative,30,16-Apr-17,"Had the 3 course lunch set on Good Friday that only cost around $23++, which is very worth considering the location of this place. Food was alright and decent, service is a bit slow though."
French,Paul,Sunday tea,negative,20,20-Jun-16,"A nice cafe for a late lunch. The sautéed mushrooms on French potato pancake was good, but the same can't be said for the pastries. Service staff was a tad non-chalant bordering arrogant. Given the many choices of premium cafes in Paragon, we will give Paul a miss the next time."
French,Angelina_MBS,Hugely disappointing ,negative,10,10-Dec-17,"We first came here a few months ago and left feeling hopeful that there is finally a decent French patisserie in Singapore. 5 visits later, we are sad to say the service and the quality of food has just gone rapidly down the hill. The staff was clueless and ignorant, the food was extremely slow to arrive and the quality was just plain horrid. So safe to say we won’t be coming back for a sixth visit. Not sure how they will survive if this continues but I do wish them luck. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Disappointing end to our stay,negative,20,08/30/13,"I travelled with my family and on our last night at the hotel we decided to try Peach Blossoms. The food was average and overpriced. We ordered the Peking Duck and could barely eat it. Was full of bones - I've eaten Peking Duck many times and not come across this so not sure what the idea is but a lot was wasted due to the bones.Service was also disappointing as the staff focused on the local customers. It was clear we were toursits and guests of the hotel (perhaps the staff figure we may not return so no need to provide good service?). At one point the chef came out and did the rounds of the restaurant, focusing on the locals - we were all but ignored.Were provided the dessert menu however our waiter never returned to our table so we had to forgoe dessert, get the bill and leave."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",excellent spot for all three meals,positive,40,14-May-13,"We were living on staple food from Komalas while on a five day trip in Singapore, till we happened to notice Murugan Idli one road behind our hotel Grand Chancellor. Our first impression on breakfast was that breakfast was very homely. Then we had takeaway...More"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Mediocre dim sum ,negative,20,6/6/2014,Came here for lunch with my mum and ordered the usual dim sum items like har gow and siew Mai.Sad to say that the standard has dropped. Skin of har gow was one of the thickest I've tried. Taste of the other items are average and pretty saltish.Guess this may be the last time I visit this place considering that there are just too many dim sum joints in Singapore.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum just a block from Chinatown MRT,positive,40,08/20/14,"I was recommended this from a friend, it's near the Santa Ana Grande hotel. Went around 9:30am on a Sunday morning.Meal wasn't overly expensive, and lots to choose from: either hot or cold options. Custard bun was good but be careful or it can pop open and you'll have custard sauce all over the table (or you!). Try a little of a few things and you can order more of the same if you like it. Good service, rarely have to wait long for them to come around again. It wasn't overly crowded yet so that was helpful.Depending on which direction you come from, it can be difficult to find the entrance, and you have to take stairs or elevator to 2nd floor to the restaurant."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",For Indians missing Idli Dosa,positive,40,30-Jan-15,"After few days in Singapore, every indian will long for an Indian meal!

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good Food.,positive,40,26-Dec-15,"Good Food, finally tried the Fish head curry, it was good.
Our service was ok, food came lil bit slow, but understandable for 16pax.
Can enjoy with family, friends and colleagues."
French,Saveur,Good for families,negative,30,19-Apr-17,"The meats were done very well. The Duck confit and pork belly were crispy yet tender on the inside. However, I did not like the soft mushy stuff that the crispy pork sat on. The signature spaghetti appetiser was interesting and quite pleasing."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food and service has long has a beach.,positive,50,10/27/13,"What a spread of sea food. From Jeo duck to alaskan crabs. You take a fixed meal and you are served with a whole spread. Dont miss the black pepper crab, it was out standing. Oh don't forget the mango pudding with the dry ice smoke. What an effect. Over all an excellent. Good meal not to forget. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chile Stone Crabs Never Disappoint,positive,50,08/23/16,Stone crabs and tiger beer a winning combination at Long Beach Restaurant. Dine outdoors on the lovely porch and enjoy! I am in Singapore ever year for business and always make it here -- my 3rd trip!
French,Poulet,"If there is a 0, I would put it .",negative,10,23-Feb-14,Poor food poor service . Food served cold . Over staffing but they still cannot give me some attention.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Very Good food ,positive,50,1-Apr-17,Very good restaurant . Near Mustafa shopping centre . They have South Indian and North Indian . Thali was also available . Prices were reasanable . Very croweded when we went for an Thursday night dinner
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Decent food but not outstanding and the service was grumpy,negative,30,3/9/2017,We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant when we went for dinner which was a good sign. It was far from crowded but we were greeted at the door as if we should have made reservations. The food was very good but not as good as I had hoped. I had the idea it was a family restaurant as there were many children. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just not the warm friendly Singapore we know and love,negative,10,03/22/13,"From the moment we entered the staff were sour and certainly far from sweet. No help was offered ordering and when the bland dull food arrived we had to ask for bowls which were ceremoniously dumped still stacked on the table, how a place like this exists I do not know, maybe they just don't like foreigners and are happy to rely on local trade, most certainly would never go back or in deed recommend."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian food place.,positive,40,30-Mar-17,"Offering pure veg food in singapore, thi place is good for people who wants to have Indian food,offering great variety in north indian food,quality is also good."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food but can improvise on cleanliness and service,negative,30,19-Apr-17,"South Indian breakfast items were tasty. Ordered coffee and the waiter brought the coffee with some of it spilled over. I guess one needs to speak in tamil for a courteous reply there. Overall, good for a quick breakfast."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Feedback,positive,40,13-Mar-17,Food variety is great. Service of staff are average. Chope printed out Groupon was show to staff before dinning but when bill arrived no discount was shown on the bill. Got to direct staff to double check the printed Groupon was with them. Time waste on billing.
French,Angelina_MBS,Worse visit ever,negative,10,11-Mar-18,"Had high hopes for this place as the Paris branch was great. Service was slow and forgot our orders. Even when the food and drinks came, everything was a mess. There were chocolate marks everywhere on the cup and table, the tea was cold by the time it arrived. Will not bother to come again. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Culinary Perfection,positive,50,30-Mar-12,"Our visit to Waku Ghin was unplanned, and having failed to reserve tables at Tetsuya's in Sydney several time, to be able to reserve a table at such a short notice was a good start. We were led to a private cubicle and the Maitre d'hotel started asking if there was any ingredient we were not consuming that night and if we liked some drinks to start with.The restaurant feels very private and classy, but not too extravagantly luxurious. We had 10 different course of the Best French Japanese Fusion Meals. Every course was both mouth-and-eye-watering, each perfectly portioned. Scallop, Sea Urchin with oscietre caviar, Bamboo Clam, Ayu with braised withlof, Abalone with fregola,Blackmore Wagyu and Tasmanian truffles were served in order. Each course has its own distinct taste and blend and with each course, the excitement just grows. To add to the excitement, Mr. Tetsuya himself came in to greet and accompany us, he explained briefly about the motive behind his first move outside Australia. Such a great gesture from the connoisseur. Surely this was easily one of the best culinary journey we have ever experienced. We had several good drinks to accompany the perfect meals including Gyokuro, the unique Japanese green tea made from selected young green tea leaves, Masuizumi, unpasteurized Junmai Ginjo made specially for Tetsuya's, Yalumba Viognier and 2001 Torbreck Grenach. To wind up the already a wonderful dinner, we were brought to a common area overlooking the Singapore Marina Bay where fireworks happened to be in display with Singapore skyline as the backdrop. Granita of Kyoho Grapes, Cheesecakes and petit four are served as desserts. Perfect Finish.The whole experience was considerably expensive, outrageously expensive by Singapore standard some may say but well worth it if it were for a special occasion. It is still a good value otherwise in my opinion. An example of culinary perfection and I would gladly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fabled gastronomic journey."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Still an enjoyable place for a weekend dim sum lunch,positive,40,03/25/16,"Starting off as a single site, the Lorong Mambong branch now encompasses three separate but related establishments - two restaurants (Kitchen and La Mian Xiao Long Bao), and a bakery (My Bread). This review pertains to our recent visit to Kitchen for a extended family Sunday lunch. We've always enjoyed coming here and although there are some limited fan-cooled seats downstairs, we usually make it a point to get tables in the air-conditioned section upstairs. Reservations are taken except on Sundays, so come early...preferably before 11.30 am. Had a dim sum selection and while the standard's probably gone down somewhat over the years, it was still decent nonetheless. Service was basic but friendly, and I was accidentally splashed on my back with some ice water by the waitress but no harm done."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","Horrible food !! No freshness , taste , hygiene . ",negative,10,29-Jul-18,"Had been there for dinner with family. Regretted going there.Absolutely avoidable . Be it the quality, hygiene or price. Substandard ,salty food."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exquisite Ala Carte Dim Sum Buffet!,positive,40,08/26/15,"For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/08/ala-carte-dim-sum-buffet-at-peach.htmlThe service here was not so good. No one attended to us to take our drinks order after we were seated for around 5-10 mins - We have to call for them. There were quite a few times we couldn't find any staff nearby us to place our food order whereby the restaurant was only half-filled. As this restaurant has 3 sections, they should assign 1 or 2 staff at each section to standby since this is a 5 star hotel. Most of the staff were not with any smile too except one of them was good.I would like to highly recommend their Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth!Overall their food quality was quite good, slightly higher than other 5 star hotel chinese restaurants that I've visited, except some of the dim sum and their dessert really needs much improvements! If only the service can be warm and better, this place will be perfect. I felt that with this price of SGD58++ per person for only 2 hours buffet during weekend is quite rush. Most people would rather go for Jade@Fullerton at only $38++ with free flow tea for about the same dining hours."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Sindhi Treat,positive,40,24-Feb-12,I was surprised to find the Sindhi delicacies that too with authentic taste. I feel it's better than the one in Mumbai. Service sometime suffers during peak hours but overall a very nice Indian restaurant
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Arrogant Attitude of Hostess,negative,20,30-Jul-17,The attitude of hostess was arrogant. I think that's because the business was too good. There's no personnel touch nor smile from her.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Nice place, should be a heritage restaurant :)",positive,50,6-Jul-17,"Nice food, perfect place for b'fast, esp if you want to escape mustafa rush in evening. Prominent visiting Indian dignitaries often seen here. Food is reasonably priced and good."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ok food choice,negative,30,26-Jan-17,Food was not thaaat nice. Priced too highly for a single cuisine meal. Lunch was like 40 plus per person? Who would be willing to spend that much on a lunch at such a deserted mall? Price should be reduced to entice more customers
French,L_Angelus,Never disappoints!,positive,50,16-Aug-18,"We go for special occasions, this was our silver wedding anniversary. We were offered complimentary champagne on arrival which was very thoughtful. We both had onion soup which was absolutely stunning. My wife had seabass and I had ribeye with gratin dauphinois and pepper sauce. We both had crepes suzette which were just gorgeous, every bite was so delicious. We finished with calcados and Amaretto.. A perfect evening with great service and warm ambiance. We'll be back many more times "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A must do venue for Japanese cuisine!,positive,40,23-Oct-14,"Be prepared for exorbitant prices for some of the best sushi in Singapore, but definitely worth the high price for this unique sushi experience. Service and attention to detail is excellent as always. Professional sushi chefs expertly prepare each course in front of you and serve it immediately. A must do venue if you're keen on Japanese food and visiting Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",SAtisfied my sashimi craving,positive,40,30-Jan-18,"Have been here quite a few time since in recent months. Service has definitely improved from years ago. Sashimi is very fresh, very worth the trip!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Excellent Indian cusine,positive,50,8-Jul-16,"Excellent Indian cuisine and great service. Medium priced.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great steak and seconds too,positive,50,1-Nov-13,"Reading other reviews there must be more than one L'entrecote in Singapore. This is the one just off Duxton Road. Went with 3 others. You cannot book, but midweek there was no queue. We had the speciality of the house - which everyone else seemed to be having. Excellent rare, succulent steak, delicious bearnaise sauce and great chips. The best bit was, just as you thought you had eaten it all, they refilled your plate! Great house red at a reasonable price too. Fantastic."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy atmosphere,positive,40,23-Dec-16,Love the service by the.. manager? Really attentive and nice. Beef steak was great as always! Love it

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Standards have dropped,negative,20,12/31/11,"Had brunch here, restaurant was crowded, service was slow and rather apathetic. Dim sum was cold, overall standard of food has dropped. And do remember to check your final bill as they overcharged me by $15"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Overpriced/Overrated,negative,30,06/30/16,"Most pieces of BBQ meat was burnt, duck was soft but the flavour wasn't there, the roasted pork was good with the mustard. Overall service was poor."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic Hawker centre with so much to choose from.,positive,50,24-May-17,You can't come to Singapore without trying the authentic Hawker centre where so many locals eat. The choice of food and freshness is amazing and unbelievably cheap for the amount and quality. Girly recommend this place. Loved it!!!
French,L_Angelus,Perfect comfort food for small groups,positive,40,25-Sep-14,"I read some of the negative reviews and feel compelled to offer a different view. If one is looking for a perfect romantic dinner for two, perhaps this is not the place. However, if you are looking for and old fashioned brasserie with standard french comfort food that can accommodate a group of say 6,8, or 10, then L'Angelus is the perfect alternative. I was there last week with a group of 10 and there were no complaints. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges and the menu hasn't changed in years, but two or three times a year it's the perfect alternative to all the newcomers. I love the place and save it for such occasions. "
French,Paul,Always a great Sandwich at Paul Takashimaya ,positive,50,6-Aug-17,"I had lunch at Paul today.
I had my Favourite Atlantique sandwich.
Nicely toasted with salmon in between and a cup of latte.
Wonderful food and service.
I think that this is one of the best Paul outlets in Singapore so worth a visit."

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Poor in Price,negative,30,10-Feb-13,"Hi,
A few point to note about this restaurant:
1) Nice taste of food and curry.
2) Good service and well mannered staffs.
3) Vegetarian dishes and drinks too expensive.
4) Lamb potion too small, no value for money.
5) Good ambience and interior decoration....More"
French,Saveur,Saveur at Cathay,positive,50,11-Feb-16,"Good ambience and also food is affordable and delicious! Must try their duck confit. There's a promotion going on, order 2 mains to get a free appetizer pasta which is totally worth it!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you like dim sum,positive,40,2/11/2017,"If you are a dim sum amateur, here is a restaurant for you in the heart of Chinatown not far from the interesting Chinatown heritage center.Essentially patronized by locals, there are few foreigners which is a good indication.I loved the scallops and green peas dim sum as well as the traditional siu mai.When you arrive at your table ask for the illustrated menu if you are not familiar with the food and fill up the form and waive it to the waiter. Service is minimal and the cashier doesn't even look at you ! But the lunch was an enjoyable classic."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Excellent Indian food,positive,40,16-Jul-14,"Went with a group for an office lunch, and though the restaurant was quiet (I understand it's lively in the evenings), the Indian food was the best i have had in three years in Singapore. I will go again."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Misleading,negative,20,11-Feb-17,"Food is not good. French fries at Mc Donald are better. Steak is OK. The pepper sauce is something... I don't know.
Being Belgian, you would expect in a restaurant pretending to be French some French food. Disappointing!
Environment is fantastic. Waitress was very kind!"
French,Poulet,Mass produced taste. Tries very hard to pass off as French.,negative,20,2-Jul-13,"Atmosphere is nice. Service is average. Price is very reasonable with good food quantity. However the dishes all tend to be on the salty side with their ""signature"" chicken taking the salt crown. Think of Poulet, think of Denny's."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Delicious South Indian Food in Singapore,positive,40,7-Jan-16,We had heard of Murugan Idli Shop during our earlier trip to Madurai. So we decoded to give it a try when we were visiting Singapore recently.The premises is nothing great to comment. Just little better than any such restaurant in South India but it...More

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Better pepper crab,positive,40,12/8/2015,"We orignally were heading top Jumbo on Dempsey Hill but was convinced to try Long Beach for pepper crab. As it's the first time we've been to Long Beach we ordered the set menu with pepper crab. Wife was really happy with the food, where each dish was quite good and the flow was commendable. Started with steamed razor clam with minced garlic. Clam itself was fresh but a bit ordinary. It was however the garlic, shallots and soy souce that was memorable. Light and not to salty or pungent. Pepper crab was a bit spicey but better than Jumbo's. Ordered a mud crab, slightly smaller than what I would have like, where the crab meat filled the shell and was very moist. The noodles with clams was very nice too. Even the vegetable dish was a treat. All in all, I think we polished off everything served. A bit pricey but both my wife and I agreed when we're around Dempsey Hill we'd be going back to Long Beach over Jumbo in the future. Location is a bit of a problem as you need a taxi to get there and back. We asked the restaurant to call a cab for us, which worked out well. Could improve on the furniture and interior though as everything looked a bit worn. Other eateries on Dempsey Hill have a flasher look but less patrons. Couldn't hurt to update the presentation. "
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good dosa but hygiene of place needs improvement,positive,40,12-Sep-15,One of the best masala dosa I have had with coffee and peda at low price. Bill amount 10.5sgd.But they need to keep place tidy and dry.
French,Saveur,Inexpensive Italian yummy foods,positive,40,11-Sep-15,"I had make a reservation prior to dinner since is a Friday evening. The restaurant has a cool and young feel. I love the food and the portion is just nice for a small eater like me. I ordered the MUST TRY dish on the menu ""Duck Panzerotti"" ($14.90). The duck meat was wrap in moon shape pasta that looks like dumpling. On top of the pasta, was some sweet potato crisp. I love the salty taste dumpling but the sweet potato crisp was a bit too hard. My friend ordered the Crab Risotto ($12.90). I normally don't like t eat risotto but this was certainly good. The texture was just nice, not too creamy and very yummy. I would come back and try others dishes another day. But the service staffs was not very attentive."

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Authentic and Hot,positive,40,8-May-13,"Love this place. Food is awesome, staff respond and the ambience is cool. Parking can be a real pain but it is worth it. Must try the chicken tikka"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Experience,positive,40,30-Oct-16,The staff who assisted us was bery helpful in educating us of the Indian dishes they served. Having eaten Indian cuisine only a handful of times still makes me a newbie and I still do not know what to order in am Indian restaurant. We were lucky to have a helpful host that made our dinner unforgetful.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nice seafood, a little more expensive than other food centres.",negative,30,19-Mar-13,"The seafood here is mostly good, but you will pay more here than you would at another food centre as many tourist are brought here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hidden Gem - Malay Coconut Rice & Curries,positive,40,6-Jun-10,"I was in Singapore for a week with my wife and we went to Newton Food Centre near our hotel. I had previously read up about the types of food there and noticed most of the stalls served very similar foods - BBQ seafood, oyster omelette, carrot cake... For a first timer we sampled some of this and it was very good. A few nights later, a local friend took us there again for dinner and this time amidst all the BBQ seafood stalls, we had the pleasure of trying some truly splendid and different food that was not aimed at the tourist community. Our friend recommended that we try the food at this stall Curry Nasi Lemak (No. 64), a traditional malay coconut rice and assorted curries and fried foods. And we were really taken by surprise by the flavours. If you are ok for spicy foods, give this stall a try. We had curry chicken which was awesome, a dried beef curry, spring rolls, and a really fantastic honey sesame chicken which isn't always available (as told by the stall owner). You can request for it, and they'll whip up a hot fresh portion for you. Coated with a black honey sauce and toasted sesame seeds on top, about US$1 per piece. I'm from the States and the asian restaurants don't come close to the flavours and spices used here. Prices are a fraction of what you would pay at the BBQ stalls, a dish costing about US$2 each versus US$30-US$50 at the BBQ stalls. Give it a try if you are looking for something different and authentic flavours, and not targeted at tourists. Mostly local people eat there.Beware though, their homemade chilli sauce is amazingly spicy... but full of flavour. Hope you find this review useful."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Top quality ingredients. Great service.,positive,40,22-May-15,"This is a really small space, basically just seats around a sushi counter but it is a 2 Michelin-star restaurant! The service was superb and ingredients used were of top quality. The chef asked if there were any ingredients that we don't eat, took note that I don't take squid and replaced it with fresh shrimps. Two of us, we ordered a nigiri sushi set and an omakase set, and the chef very thoughtfully split the two sets among us so that we both got to try everything. My favourites of the dinner were uni (sea urchin) and akami (tuna belly). Melted in the mouth! Each grain of rice was round and full. Dessert was musk melon and matcha ice cream, not too sweet, very subtle on the palate which was a great way to finish the dinner wholesomely."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",It is the best,positive,40,22-Jul-15,This restaurant is right next to ferrer park mrt . . .The food that you find here can be compared to authentic indian food that you can find in india in top quality restaurants no matter which city you live in . . . the dal makhani is simply yum . . plz try it and you would want to go over and over again . . its a bit pricey though
French,L_Angelus,Constant quality... and affordable!,positive,50,12-Sep-11,"Went there 3 times for complete meals and I have to say that I enjoyed the experience a lot. The food is exactly the same quality as during my childhood (I'm French), homey style and tasty. Foie gras, Salade nicoise (the true one, with green beans), Crême brûlée (not heavy on the stomach, not too much sweetened). All these classical are done quite well, and in a generous portions... The cheeses are just mature and tasty enough, and the wine selection very worth for the price. Yes, the service is sometimes relaxed (not a person constantly looking over your shoulders), but, in my opinion, much better if you wanna appreciate the authentic atmosphere and the good food. Not the mention the excellent bread that comes with your plate and the free appetizers (peanuts and olive). This is the place to go for tasting wine and cheese, less hyped but much more worth than Wine Connection for instance..."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak - Good staff,positive,50,8-May-17,We really fancied a good steak and we got one. My wife and I shared the Cote De Boeuf. What a great steak. It was just so tasty and cooked exactly as we ordered. Had a really nice bottle of red to go with it and had a really enjoyable evening. Staff were great and chilled ice water was continually topped up.
French,Paul,Food was decent but service a disaster!,negative,10,23-Jan-17,"Went for late lunch around 4pm in the afternoon. Only about 4 tables including us. Lady Staff who sat us looks really ""not in the mood today"". But I looked past that since this is the norm in Singapore these days. The male staff serving our table simply made me felt like I was dining in a funeral parlor. Avoided eye contact while serving and just brought the plate to our table without a word expecting us to make a space for him to dump the plate so he can go off. After we were done, he preferred to loiter around shifting forks on empty table than to clear our table. Big turn off and lost my appetite for dessert. When I asked for the bill, the lady just passed me the bill with dessert included. I told her I didn't get any dessert and she should remove it from billed. She just took the bill, cancel it then passed me the updated bill without asking or bothering what happened to he dessert. I will never step in here again and it is utterly disgusting for Paul to include service charge if this is the kind of staff that they can put in the front line. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awesome food!,positive,40,30-Jul-17,Awesome food as usual! Love their creamy salmon sashimi. And it's superb that you can order food by pieces!
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,positive,50,30-Dec-14,"A unique experience, very fresh & well prepared sushi, excellent service. Booking a table is advisable. For a better price, go for lunch."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",birthday lunch on a weekday,positive,40,7-Jul-17,birthday voucher redemption was a breeze for my hubby's birthday which falls on a weekday. Food was served very fast upon ordering. Food standard is still as good. Worthwhile the price for their buffet.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Rare find for a Saturday lunch,positive,50,24-Oct-17,Lucky to find this fantastic restaurant in Duxton Hill open for Saturday lunch when most other restaurants in the same area are closed.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A bit too expensive,negative,30,2/4/2016,A crowded restaurant with a few branches in Singapore. Famous for their crabs. The famous chili crab is abit too spicy. Slight expensive
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",fav restaurnt in singapore,positive,40,13-Nov-08,"Singapore is famous for its hawker centres, and if you want to go to the city's most famous one then visit this one. It's a bit out of the city centre, which is a bit of a pain (there's a subway station nearby though), but food is cheap and plentiful."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood,positive,40,09/13/17,The food is OK. Average seafood. No choice for vegetarians. The staffs are nice and the service is good. A bit pricey. Went for CNY celebration lunch
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore","Average Food, Average Ambience",negative,30,28-Dec-13,"Disappointed with the quality of food and the ambiance. Very cramped seating and average music.
Tandoori Chicken was good. The rest was average. Fish was smelly. Fruit custard was one of the worst I have tasted. Spread as such was not great.
Service though was...More"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,No queue,positive,40,10/28/16,Went in on a rainy Friday evening for dinner with my lucky self.Had the duck noodles and the crispy pork. The duck noodles were good. Not a big portion but enough to taste duck and noodles together in one plate. The soup was rather peppery but the duck was tender with some bones to challenge. Noodles were well done. Not too soft yet springy and with good texture. Crispy pork serving was a bit small but all good in taste and the skin was crispy and wafer thin. Best was the chilli dip. Shiok. Not sure why mustard was served with crispy pork. Bad combo.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing,positive,50,23-Mar-13,"I walked to the restaurant through MBS and did not expect to find such a perfect restaurant in the casino. We went as the big group of 9, sake Jumnai Daiginjo was very good beyond our expectation. Great food and warm service."

The chestnut cream is to die for! The overall service was average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Little variety available & slow service,negative,20,3-Dec-17,"Went on a weekday lunch and there were only a few other tables occupied. Despite it not being packed, the food was being served slow. Coupled with the little variety available for its buffet, doubt we will return in the near future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money Japanese Buffet,positive,50,28-Nov-16,This is a great place for unlimited Japanese food at a reasonable price.The assortment of sashimi offered is pretty good. I love the tuna as it's very fresh.All items comes in pretty small sizes which is great as it gives your stomach a chance to savour as much variety as you want.A definite must try if you're into good quality Japanese buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice sashimi,negative,30,21-Jun-17,"I read a review on this restaurant so naturally I had my expectations/hopes up. The sashimi was nice and fresh but the items fell below expectation. Thankfully I had the birthday voucher, otherwise I would feel it was not worth the money per pax. I was given a $10 voucher for the next visit but I doubt I will return."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sushi Buffet,positive,40,4-Jul-16,"The choices are quite a lot, and they suit our palate just fine, especially the pumpkin chawanmushi. The place is a little bit dim, but the service is swift & excellent."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","""Very Posh Nosh"" at an Exceptional Restaurant",positive,50,11-Apr-13,"A fabulous experience, one not to be missed. Tetsuya's Singapore restaurant is amazing, the service is perfect, your meal is prepared by your own private chef on a high tech teppanyaki grill, and the food is absolutely amazing. 10 courses which were the perfect size so not overly full at the end of the meal. Sea Urchin, Wagyu Beef, Lobster, and more, just fabulous. After dinner, coffee taken in a lounge area, along with dessert wine and Petit Fours overlooking Marina Bay and the last laser light show of the night. An exceptional evening, with a price tag to match."
French,Poulet,Nice dining environment and service,positive,40,24-Oct-13,"Did not know that there is an outlet in Jurong Point, just was looking around in the mall for dinner venue, and came across this restaurant. I did not know about this restaurant much until recently my friend went to dine in their Bugis outlet, and was praising the food was nice. Therefore, my husband and I went into this restaurant to try as we trusted this friend's taste very much. First the environment, we were led into the restaurant by a waitress, there are outdoor seating and indoor seating and we chose indoor ones. The place is bright and tidy, with some photos of food on the white walls and some trees indoor. Nice and neat. Staffs were very courteous too. Food wise, I do not know what is the taste of Authentic French food, but all I know is that the food are nice, chicken are well toasted. The staff recommended me to try their popular Cranberry sauce chicken, which I think is not too bad, the mushroom soup is nice too but I do not like their French onion soup. My husband ordered the pork belly, which I had tasted and is better than my cranberry sauce chicken. Escargot is normal, nothing fantastic, but I like the dessert Tiramisu. Sweet on the top where the cream is and bitter at the bottom where the alcohol is. Price wise, is affordable, much cheaper than most French restaurants. It cost us about $75 for a plate of cranberry sauce chicken(half chicken), a plate of pork belly, a plate of escargot, one tiramisu, one onion soup and one mushroom soup, a few slices of baguette and a bottle of mineral water. But one thing many not happy with is the charge they imposed on water, they do not provide cold plain water instead they sell mineral water at 1.80 each bottle which can be shared between two persons, and they will provide warm water at 50cents each glass refillable. Well, some may think is unreasonable but I think it's a trend now as more and more restaurants are practicing this.So, if you are not so particular about getting Authentic French food and want a nice place to sit down and dine, this may be the one suitable for you. If you want to try very authentic French cuisine, this may not be one. It already called itself a casual French restaurant. As for me, I will go back again to try other dishes. Heard their mushroom and tomatoes not bad too!!!"
French,Angelina_MBS,A little bit of France in Singapore,positive,40,20-Jun-16,"As a French person having lived in Singapore for 6 years now, it's nice to have a touch of home from time to time. Angelina delivers this with it's Parisian theme. It's also located in a convenient place (Capitol Piazza), which makes it a good go-to place for a break in the middle of the workday, or for weekend brunch. I've been there several times, and it is always a pleasure to share a Mont-Blanc with a friend, and to enjoy their absolutely scrumptious hot chocolate. The main difference is that in France, Angelina is mostly known only for its hot chocolates, teas and pastries. But here in Singapore I tried out some savory dishes, including the Truffle ravioli, the 'Pan-seared duck foie gras', and the pumpkin soup - a good range of dishes from light to hearty. It is also very pleasant to see that the Angelina Team is warm and welcoming, not always easy to find in Singapore - or in Paris in fact! I would definitely recommend Angelina for fellow foodies looking for a tasty lunch or dinner, or a sweet treat."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Our first dining experience at Shin Minori,negative,30,29-Aug-16,"Overall, the food and service are up to our expectations. The only bad experience is finding our way to the building's carpark."
French,Angelina_MBS,Good service and dessert,positive,40,2-Dec-16,"Overall experience was pleasant. Not too crowded maybe cause it was a weekday evening. Food was good, had seafood risotto and opera cake."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Family dinner,positive,40,24-Jan-17,This was the 1t time we dine at Shin Minori restaurant. It was recommended by my colleague. Overall food ok but serving flow was a bit slow but speed up later. Probably it was a Sunday dinner & more diners.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Utterly Brilliant,positive,50,20-Jan-12,"Dinner at Tetsuya Wakuda's venture ""Waku Ghin"" in Singapore. There are two seatings per night and the first must have been running late as there was a 10-15 minute wait at the bar.The restaurant is divided into a series of rooms each with seats at a counter and large teppan. The majority of the dishes are cooked on the teppan in front of you by a single chef through the evening. Desserts are served in a single larger room with regular tables and a view of the bay.The dish highlights were the Crushed potato with smoked eel, Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin and Oscietre Caviar, Steamed Alaskan King Crab with Yuzu scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon.Service was excellent - friendly and well informed.I would recommend it as the food is utterly brilliant, easily among my favourites from the trip, I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Neat & clean,positive,40,20-Jul-16,"Looks clean . All Indian , north and south are available. Only vegetarian but no service by waiters, SELF SERVICE. Food is served in clean environment, AIr conditioning is a must, in Singpore and good."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","To Go To place for South Indian , especially idlis",positive,50,24-Sep-14,"Was there last night for dinner with a friend.
Ended up ordering the usual suspects - Idli, Vada and Dosa. Enjoyed them.
Must try if you have not been to any of its outlets in Chennai where the stuff is more authentic and tastier.
Bitter...More"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great,positive,40,28-Mar-17,"Had a high expectation on the Wagyu ribeye but it wasn't as good as expected, which wasn't value for the money. I requested for a small surprise for my Boyfriend's birthday and the staff assisted me for it. Service was excellent! And for those who love fries, they do top up fries for free!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,positive,40,18-Dec-16,Had a very good dinner at Shin Minori on Friday. This restaurant has been around for many years and they dish out decent Japanese food.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,negative,30,17-Jun-15,"This joint is located in busy area of Little India. It is famous for Indian fast food & sweets. Only veg items are available. It is expensive with regard to the food quality, service & ambience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall not bad,negative,30,9-Nov-17,"Food was not bad, but sashimi could have been fresher. Grilled dishes were very salty, so was the agedashi tofu. Worth it given the birthday voucher but if not for it then probably not. iPad ordering is good but can include a page on the outcome of the food i.e. an ordered list, cooking/preparing list and then a served list so that customers know what dishes has arrived, what they have ordered and hasn't arrived and what dishes they are eating. iPad also better to be held, not clamped to table as it was quite hard to maneuver. But overall not bad, service good too. Would go again if there's similar discount/1-1."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch on Sunday,negative,30,27-Sep-17,Crowded. Food is average. Some food not cook in Japanese way like quail egg. They fried it before grill. The cold dish sour plum cucumber..they did not use Japanese cucumber so the taste was weird. 1 order paper was tucked under 1pc of our salmon teriyaki. Is not a hygiene way of serving. My Japanese friends are not impressed. I was shocked too. The order tablet hang at least 3 times and created double order. We showed the staff we had already finished our food but the service staff kept showing us 2 orders of same food. We thought is our mistake so we accepted it. The 3rd times it happened we spoke to someone higher and he was more understanding and removed the extra food we did not order. Is my first time at Shin Minori and is a little disappointing experience for a Japanese Restaurant. I may try again if they improve on food quality and hygiene standard.
French,Saveur,Saveur,positive,50,18-Oct-17,Service of the restaurant and the app are both efficient. Would come here again with family and friends.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best in class,positive,50,20-Aug-12,"Food: This is the best sushi/sashimi in Singapore. Obviously its super expensive and you won't getaway for less than $250/person - some (but not all of the price) is accounted for in the produce being air flown from Tsukiji. (If you want something that is great, but less expensive, try Tatsuya at Goodwood Park Hotel where you will start around $150/person). The dishes served at Shinji are more traditional sushi and maki dishes (you won't get many torched sushi dishes). In terms of execution it was all top notch and there were no flaws whatsoever in the sushi rice, the freshness of the fish or service.Service: Excellent. Ambiance: Traditional Japanese setting - mainly counter seating (which is my favourite anyway so you can chat with the chefs about what is in season). There are 2 or 3 little private rooms I think."
French,Saveur,Good food at central location,positive,40,2-Sep-14,"Stumbled on this place for lunch on Saturday noon. Pleasant environment, food wise, most dishes were great. I had the squid ink risotto which was really good. The squid salad also very good. WIll give the prawn fettucine a miss next time as it turned out to be too similar to a local dish called ""mee pok"". Prices were reasonable and there's a promo for drinks when you get a main dish. Service was just ok. Will go there again only because the food is good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not like the original,negative,30,7-Jun-14,"I went there with my friends expecting the same experience as we had at L'Entrecote in France and the UK but got disappointed. The classic dish was made different here. Salad had a simple vinaigrette sauce with whole walnuts thrown on top instead of the creamy/ Caesar dressing w cut walnuts mixed together. The meat was ok but the sauce was very different. This defeats the purpose of this style of restaurant where you expect consistent quality and taste in any outlet across the world. Ah, and as other people already said, service is just about average. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good quality of food,positive,50,29-Oct-13,We had great dinner here with great sushi rice The drinks were emotional and staffs worked great. The restaurant was easy to find and this got great ambiance.

I still like the food there..great Seafood!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Typical efficient chain...,negative,20,4/9/2008,Typical efficient chain. Their la mian varies in quality because the staff let it sit on the counter and lose the 'al dente-ness'. Good for the price.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Best Idlis in Singapore ,positive,40,25-Dec-16,"I come here for breakfast everyday! The idlis and the chutneys here are amazing! The staff here are not the most professional, as they talk loudly, yet they treat the customers well.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A foodies delight,positive,40,1-Jun-15,"There are so many vendors from which to choose a massive amount of dishes. We had carrot cake, oyster omelette, sweet and sour and fried rice. All of the dishes offered different flavours, were quickly delivered to the table and of a high quality. Although our taxi driver suggested that it was more expensive and mainly pitched at tourists, we still enjoyed the experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth the price,positive,50,13-Jun-16,The food there is really fantastic. Recommend to reserve a seat in advance because it filled up quickly.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Local food, great taste",positive,40,09/17/15,"I was taken here by people in the know. This is not fine dining, its rough and ready with plastic chairs. Service is fun and on it, really enjoyed the banter, although not completely sure anyone knew what was going on. So, we had some starters and then the main event which was Chili and Black Pepper crab. Strangely do eat the Chili crab first as the Black Pepper leaves your mouth numb. Fortunately some local noodle dish took away some of the numbness. My friends ordered some kind of fried buns which went in the Chili sauce and added to the yumminess of the whole experience. Cheap Plum Saki which was lovely, some good service and the night was made, The crabs were properly cracked and cooked, everything was very tasty, and there is a plethora of taps to wash up after right outside the door, bibs to protect clothes from splashes of the various sauces. Worth a try, great vibe and you have options to sit in or outside (depending on the Haze and the Heat)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but poor service,negative,30,13-Mar-17,"The service was slow... We have to wait quite a while before drinks were served or to get the attention of the waiters/ waitresses to check on our missing orders. But the food served was fresh, especially the sashimi."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy yummy,positive,40,07/17/16,"Cant use words to describe how delicious of the food. You can try different crabs in singapore, this one with black pepper is highly recommended for those who love spicy."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable good food with nice ambiance in Chinatown,positive,50,11/12/2015,"We enjoyed the food. They are tasty and above average. Reasonable price too. Good location right in the heart of Chinatown. A little challenging to locate the entrance though.I booked using Chope and it was a breeze. I received confirmation via email almost instantly despite it was late at night and the night before a public holiday. However, the staff at Yum Cha told me that they do not accept booking on public holidays. I was adviced to feedback to Chope. The queue was long at the restaurant and no way I could let my guests wait in the queue. Thankfully the staff was nice to honour the booking. She got one table for us after 10 mins which I was very thankful. I hope Chope can sort out the booking policies with the participating restaurants to prevent such incidents."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,positive,40,30-Nov-16,"A good ala cart japanese buffet with sizeable range of food.

French,Paul,Watery Coffee & Average Baked Goods,negative,10,9-Oct-15,"After trying Paul's in Tokyo, which we loved, we were eager to try one of the branches in Singapore. We were at the one in MBFC for coffee and cake. Got a Capuccino, Marochino, croissant, and a fruit tart. Wanted to try some of their other cake but they were out of everything else.The coffee was just rank bad - watery and tasteless. They didn't heat the croissants so they tasted quite faintly of stale butter. The fruit tart was average, nothing to write home about. And, it was quite pricey to boot, which isn't acceptable for this sort of insipid food. Paul's was very disappointing and there was nothing really that could salvage this for us."
French,Saveur,Valentine Date,positive,50,17-Feb-18,Food was great and their duck confit is a must order. However the staff seems rather short handed and multiple request from customers can overwhelm their workflow.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Chinese Ever,negative,10,02/20/12,"There is little I liked about this restaurant. Food was bad, service was bad, and the price was high for the bad food and service.Also this location serves shark fin, and does not even know that the rest of the world is stopping this practice. The servers try to creat a more expensive bill by not letting you see the lunch menu. They also do not explain the menu very well. I would definately not recommend this restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic sashimi,positive,50,16-Sep-16,"Booked last minute because we were feeling sashimi. We were of two minds after reading the reviews on how bad the service is, but decided to push ahead having not seen anything other than positive comments about the quality of the food. Glad we did. This place is great. We had no issues with the service and the sashimi is fantastic. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Average Food,negative,30,15-Jul-15,Pure Vegetarian food with decent taste. The ambiance is clean. I had dosa and the service was ok.. The restaurant is open 24 x 7.
French,Paul,Horrendous pastries with equally horrendous service to match,negative,10,15-Jun-18,"Food: Croissant was ugly and served without even being toasted. True enough, taste was mediocre. Chocolate cake was dry, totally lacking in flavour and fragrance. To my amusement, they could actually botch up a glass of latte; it tasted so bland that a Starbucks latte even on a bad day easily triumphs it. Service: Inattentive, insincere, ignorant team of service staff who seem like they do not possess a modicum of pride in their work and delivery of service. Requested for a glass of iced water a few times to no avail. Unless ""iced water"" is a completely foreign subject, I do not understand the look of confusion on this one particular lady waitress; she couldn't even be bothered to utter a word in reply appropriately. Overall, don't bother about wasting your money here. You can have better pastries and service elsewhere in Orchard. And yes, even Starbucks. You are welcome everyone."

At the prices on their menu you would expect much better service. Instead, like a cheap diner, the customer has to order through a tablet. The tablet is not user friendly nor intuitive. My sister had an entertainment 2 for 1 sashimi voucher, which made the price affordable (but we still paid close to $80 in total for the two of us). We did have leftover food, but the restaurant refused to let us take this home unless we paid an extra $15 charge!!! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Black Pepper Crab but Mediocre Service,positive,40,06/18/18,"We had a reservation and were seated quickly as requested outside. The setting of the restaurant is always beautiful in the evening. The food was excellent but the service was really not so good this time. Food came quickly but water refills, getting the bill, paying the bill etc was slow and cumbersome. We will return but hope the site management will address the service. Our previous visit was a 5 star.... and this had the potential to be as well."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",The El Bulli + Fat Duck of the East... A foodie experience not to be missed when in Singapore,positive,50,17-Dec-10,"This is my 4th visit and everytime I have come here, the experience has been a tour-de-force for the palette, never once disappointing - standards still kept high. If you've been to Tetsuya's in Sydney's, this place ratches the ""wow"" at least 5 notches. Be forewarned that reservatiions here are difficult to come by - with at least a week or two prior recommended. The experience however doesn't start off too well as the lobby area before you get to the food looks strangely like a souless airport lounge with an empty bar area. Ushered quickly to one of the 3 or 4 private rooms, the show begins as you sit down in front of a large teppan grill and the chefs present the fresh food of the day. This is really the soul of Waku Ghin - the fresh ingredients. Unlike fat duck or el bulli - there is no magic molecular gastronomy - it is just simply the best of the freshest ingredients from Australia or Japan that money can buy - combined in the most delightfully simple of ways - executed to a science, but performed as an art in front of you... the loving way the chefs prepare each dish in front of your eyes is a visual treat in itself - not to be missed. A cautionary note here that with the freshest and best ingredients - comes a very hefty price tag with a wine paired 6 course dinner setting you back about $700 per person. Without the wine is $400.On to the food - WG's signature dish: Uni with bontan shrimp and cavier - does not disappoint. It is always consistently amazing. My other favorite is by special request only so try to ask for this : a lightly charcoal grilled tuna belly - with charcoal from Japan giving the tuna belly a wonderful just slighly smoky aroma and taste. Served with the tinest portions of grated ginger and fresh wasabi - it is an amazing palette kicker.The other courses are good - but the first two I mentioned are truly outstanding.The abalone (somewhere towards the end) - though visually stunning whilst cooking - is not to my liking as it come out a tad too rubbery and flavors clash. I would suggest you ask to replace this if you are not a fan of abalone anyway.The Kagoshima beef (Grade 5) at the very end served 2 ways - completes the experience with just the right amount of meat. Slowcooked for the last 30 minutes - it melts in your mouth.. paired with garlic chips (fr Japan) - to die for! Lastly, the palette cleansing tea at the end - is very refreshing and tastes very much like a seaweed broth and clearly some of the finest tea leaves used.Desserts are OK - so if you are already full and choose to skip - you won't be missing out."

Armed with some better knowledge, and a little bit of caution, a much improved experience. Do not eat anything that does not have a price. A huge variety of local food, follow the locals and eat where it's busy and you won't go wrong. Use some common sense and you will not be disappointed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","2 separate visits within a week, both great",positive,50,17-Apr-12,"There are lots of negative reviews on TA regarding this place with most seemingly written by Singaporeans. I guess it's the same as most cities - the locals have their favourites that may be off the beaten track and tend to avoid touristy places - we do the same at home in Perth.That said, we ate at Newton twice in a week and both times went to shop #46. Mr Liang looked after us both times.On both occasions we had 1kg black pepper crab, 1kg chilli crab, buns, fried rice (1 x chicken + 1 x seafood) plus a small serving of half-cooked cockles. The price on both occasions was a bit over SGD$80 for the food plus another SGD$18 for drinks. Maybe that is a lot for Singaporeans but for us, from Australia, we thought it good value for the excellent products we received.We can offer no recommendations for anywhere other than shop #46 (and the drinks shop next door, #45??) but we have no hesitation in recommending shop #46. Ask for Mr. Liang and say that we sent you!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Horrible service by captain.,negative,10,07/21/15,"Came for dimsum but was shocked with waitress foul attitude. Her tone of voice was haughty as though there's no other restaurants we could go for dimsums. We could anytime go to Yan Ting, Peach Blossom, Summer Palace, Asia Grand, Royal China or Spring Court & be welcomed witb open arms & hearty smiles. Even the captain Simon couldnt care less whenever we gave feedbacks to him, he is too aloof as though he was indispensable. Silver Fish had deteriorated a lot over the years, soggy with oil. The skin of Har Kao is thicker than before & hard. Siu Mai had so much fatty pork. Worst of all was the century egg porridge which had only one tiny wee 5mm bit size of century egg & the rest was plain congee. Seriously, this is daylight robbery. Service was lousy & food was terrible yet management was never bothered with customers' constructive feedbacks. Only one chinese female waitress did a great job as she was pleasant, efficient, caring & helpful to our needs. After supporting Yum Cha Gardens since it first opened in Serangoon Gardens, it kicked off with fanfare for 3 years then continually deteriorating till today. Would i recommend, ""no way"" bcos i dont want to lose my reputation for such lousy food & lousy service."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab and Chilli Prawns,positive,40,10/18/16,"Myself and son visited this place for lunch today. We ordered the following :-1) Margarita- the cocktail was just about average.2) Pepper Crab- this was awesome, the best part was that they shelled the same on request. Eating it without all the effort was superb. Fresh crab, succulent meat. Spice was just perfect and recommend for those who enjoy pepper and spice.3) Chilli Prawns/Shrimps- the chilli sauce or gravy and the perfectly cooked fresh Prawns are an awesome combination. Dip the hot, soft and really soft buns into the gravy and it is paradise.4) Veg/mushroom noodles- was just average nothing to rave about. The service was attentive and good. Prices are almost fine dining prices. Enjoyable experience."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect choice for vegeterians,positive,40,17-Feb-15,"If you are a pure vegetarian or looking for authentic north Indian vegetarian food during your trip to Singapore your search ends here. Service is quick, food is delicious and staff doesn't resort to rules to say 'no' as is pretty evident elsewhere in the city. Restaurant is air-conditioned and ambiance is just fine. For a sumptuous north Indian we paid around 90-100 SD for 5 adults so quite a value for money."

We had originally put in a request for indoor seating but all requests are not guaranteed. When we arrived, we were told that our reservation came in after all indoor tables were booked. Looking around I could see why. The inside of the restaurant was tiny. They were wonderful at finding us a seat outside and although it was a particularly hot night, they had fans outside which kept us comfortable. Turns out that it was more enjoyable sitting outside by the bustling River. I'll make outdoor reservations next time. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. We had a wonderful evening and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I look forward to our next visit and will be using Chope reservations again."

Cuts of sashimi is great unlike some restaurants which are just thin slices. However, the service is terrible. The tablet menu crashes and took a while to recover. The staff were not really around to be called. Ordered food and the items came out in wrong quantity and no one bother letting us know what is what. Had to remind the order is not served. Had to repeat three times and I have to personally walk to the counter to remind. That was after about 30 min of waiting. Impression left on my guest was less to be desired. "

The roll was filled with lettuce and tomato and had a really nice mustard mayo. The coffee...well the coffee is real coffee and excellent. Nice staff, great service and very relaxing. Good work."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,way over rated,negative,10,3-Apr-14,"i was here to celebrate my birthday but the experience was not a celebratory one. The service was sloppy where the waiter served my dish by dropping it instead of placing it in front of me and he did the same over my shoulder across to my friends and had to ask several times before getting our water glass refilled.I had onion soup as starter and it tasted really blend. When i asked the waiter about it, his reply was that many customers did feedback that it's watery but that's the 'style' of their soup and that is why they placed salt and pepper on the table for us to season it ourselves.Their singular main course which is steak was tender and portion was generous but it tasted blend and I had to depend on their 'winning formula secret sauce' for flavour, which is sourish."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Ok - quite heavy ,negative,30,06/25/18,In fairness we may have made poor choices! The dim sum did seem to be more substantial than flavourful. Nice environment and staff.
French,Saveur,"Delicious, but Complacent to Allergies",negative,30,21-Sep-16,"My fiancée and I dined here on Sunday, 18 September. We had made a reservation so we were seated immediately and staff were quick enough to take our order. My other half and I decided to each have the 3-course set dinner menu: she ordered the foie gras starter, beef tenderloin and chocolate and hazlenut dessert, while I had salmon for starters and mains and the dessert entitled ""cookies & milk"". Unfortunately, none of these courses had any further descriptions save the names of the dishes on the page (no ingredients lists or allergy/dietary warnings; see the image attached). We were also not informed that the dishes were listed separately on other parts of the menu, something which is not always done in restaurants (it is not unusual for dishes to be designed specially for set menus).In any case, it transpired that the dessert I had ordered contained peanuts to which I am allergic, though only mildly. My fiancée had asked the waiter regarding the desserts whether they contained peanuts and he stated that they did not, only hazelnuts. I was surprised, however, that he did not investigate our enquiry any further than this, such as check with the chef.I subsequently had an allergic reaction to my dessert, but was able to recover without medical attention. When we brought up the lack of warnings with staff, they were nonplussed by events and simply asked us to direct our feedback to their generic enquiries email address which we promptly did (we have as yet received no reply).Overall, the food (as pictured) was very good, but the lack of customer care, certainly where something as serious as food allergy is concerned, left something to be desired."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",North Indian Street Food Favourites - Good food but not so reasonable,positive,40,16-Apr-13,"If you want to savour typical North Indian street and junk food favourites - this is the place to go.The selection of ""Chaats"" is very good and the 'Methi Chola - Bhatura' was amazing.Go with a good appetite though - you will feel so full afterwards that you will want someone to drag you home!.I had a small issue with the mango lassi which was sour due to the yogurt sitting out for too long. It was replaced immediately with another glass which also was sour. The friendly staff offered to compensate me with complimentory dessert which I declined as I was already bursting at the seams!.Good fun sunday brunch hangout."
French,Saveur,It's heavenly!,positive,50,13-Jul-14,"It looks good, smells lovely and tastes heavenly! We popped in for lunch on a whim, when we had originally set out for ramen. However the tailback for the carpark at Bugis+ was atrocious so we zipped over to the Cathay instead.What a treat! The tuna pan seared was fabulous with its salad and sauces, as was the grilled octopus and bed of shredded fennel.The piece de resistance was without doubt the Wagyu Tender; done medium rare it melts in your mouth accompanied by the dulcit tones of the foie gras. The other main we had was the beef oyster blade. Very tender and beautifully seasoned and plated, it was of a standard that wouldn't be out of place in any of the other fine dining French establishments in town.Treat yourself, it's amazing! "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Food,positive,40,5-Sep-13,"If you want to try out some authentic food of Singapore, this is the place to be. This is quite famous for being there for decades now, and I first found out about it from my dad who went there in the 1990s. I've been there twice, each of my two SG stay. It is like a giant outdoor foodcourt where tourists and locals alike eat and drink. Owners will enthusiastically call and encourage you to buy from their booths as you pass by them. However, we were stopped by a local owner who called out that were Filipinos, and continuously said ""Masarap alimango"" (translation: delicious crab). We were taken to a table, followed by the food owner with it's graphic menu and detailed prices. This made us communicate with each other easier. We wanted something else not on the menu, so he referred us to his co-seller. The food would be delivered to our table, and we had to pay up immediately. What we ate: Cereal Prawns, Chicken and Pork Satay, Chinese-cooked Cabbage, and Yang Chow Fried Rice. (During my first visit, we ordered Chili Crabs and Lemon Chicken). Overall, it was a good experience as we savored our food up to the last bite. We spent around 10 sgd each.The only thing I'd like to comment is that it's quite tricky going there using the MRT or Bus. Make sure to memorize the bus numbers or train station you'd get off to."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,First time visit to Singapore's L'entrecote,positive,40,15-Oct-12,"We have visited L'entrecote in Geneva several times, and it one of our favourite places to eat when we are there. However, as we are now living in Singapore we decided to go to the newly opened Singaporean version, and compare. Our first impressions were good as we were met at the door by a friendly staff member, most Singaporeans are friendly though, and he guided us to a table. All the tables, at both Geneva and Singapore, are very close together, so be warned if you are expecting the usual space between you and the next table. The service is very swift, at both places, and our 'waitress' came to our table very quickly to take our order. We asked that the food not be brought out until we had finished our aperitif, but they brought it out too soon, before we had got half way through our drinks, so we sent it back, and they apologised. The wine selection is excellent and we enjoyed an enjoyable Australian vintage--but then we are fans of Australian wine, so are unashamedly biased. The food is very good as the steaks were cooked as we asked, and the sauce for the steaks (that's all you can order) was as good as that at Geneva. However, in Singapore they don't give you a fresh plate when you've finished the first steak and chips, as they do in Geneva, and we prefer the Geneva way--yes, you have two portions of both anyway, so go hungry.The staff are great here, we had fun, and they are much more friendly than in Geneva, where you really have to work at communicating with the staff.The bill was very reasonable for what we had. So, which did we prefer, Geneva or Singapore? Well, without a doubt, it has to be Singapore, as we had a great evening there. So, will we be going back? Yes, definitely."

Regardless of what enquires we enquire, she gave us a very black face and only replied us that our reservation is at 745PM so we cannot sit in early.

Roast duck and chicken combination was great too. However, didn't rate it a five as it is rather standard fare though well prepared, no special differentiating factor that caught my attention. Service was efficient and the decor was great, worthy of photographs; nice view of the harbour and not too cramped like the restaurants in the malls, space is a commodity in singapore.

The wee burner that they kept our second portion of steak on did nothing, sadly.

The sashimi was the freshest I have ever tasted. There was also a number of fusion Japanese dishes which he so proudly created. The Chef's creation is a must try. Very unique and mouth watering as I write this article. My wife and I will definitely go back there again. The only setback is that the dinner will put a hole in your pocket. My damage for the evening was SGD1,500 but like I said, Pricey but worth every cent!"
French,Paul,Small portions,negative,30,22-Mar-16,"Portions are rather small and not very appetizing as what one pays for it. Strange that the recipes and food quality are not the same as in other countries. Service is nothing to talk about it .
Such a shame ."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average food, Understaffed",negative,20,13-Jun-16,Food is of average quality. Rice used in sushi not real Japanese rice and of wrong proportions. Orders were frequently late or did not get served at all.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fantastic,positive,50,26-Apr-15,This is a MUST in Singapore. The food is spectacular and interestingly composed. Service and presentation was exceptional. View from the post dining room great too which allows you to chill and talk. Problem is getting a reservation.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration,positive,50,10/14/16,My family celebrated my mother's birthday earlier this month with a fine dinner at Peach Blossom. The excellent service and food made our day for the joyous occasion. Thank you.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good Service, Average Food.",negative,30,7-Mar-17,"Overall, it was a good experience. The sashimi were fresh and the cooked dishes were average, not bad but nothing amazing about it. We went for the promotion (Free Alaska Snow Crab Nabe with every 2 paying adult for lunch buffet). Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of waiting and inquiring about the waiting time after ordering the Nabe for a couple of times, we were informed that the Alaska Snow Crab Nabe ($32) was not available, which they replaced with the Hotate Chizu Mentaiyaki (5 pcs at $22.00, but we were only given 4 pieces).However, the service staffs were cheery and friendly, which I appreciate very much."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",The Worst South Indian Food,negative,10,8-Oct-13,"Terrible Paneer Thosai - absolutely tasteless filling and they have forgotten how to make sambhar.
The filter coffee too was pathetic.
The service took 30 minutes.
When I mentioned this to the staff they were non challant about it.
Will never go back. I am...More"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Unique dinning, would do it again!",positive,50,3-Aug-17,"I've been eyeing this restaurant for so long from IG posts. When I had a chance to visit Singapore I booked one month in advance to secure my spot. I went solo as none of my friends were able to justify the price. In my opinion, you live once, you have to try it! The dinning experience was so unique, this is my first time in a very fine dinning restaurant and I must admit I was not sure what to expect but I know that it should be worth the money! Service was impeccable and the food was, unique and of great quality, everything was so delightful from start to finish! I love the privacy of the experience, I was with 2 other couples and really like the interaction of the chef cooking in front of you and the waitress that seems to pop out of no where whenever you need refill, serving and when you finish your dishes. I hardly have to lift a finger, only there to eat, eat and eat!! I would actually do it again in the future if I had a chance to go back to Singapore, just hope their menu change daily as I wouldn't want to go back to eat the exact same thing again, this is of course due to the price of the set menu. Though their signature Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar can stay!"
French,Paul,Worst service ever. Don’t waste your time,negative,10,12-Aug-18,"My 3rd time eating at a Pauls in Singapore. All experiences have been nothing short of catestrophic. Service on all occasions was utterly disgraceful. On one occasion they didn’t take out order for 25 minutes. When I approached the counter to try and place an order, I was told to go back to my table and that they would come. Except they didn’t. Another occasion, our waiter seemed to be angry that we came and abruptly announced that they had pretty much nothing left on the menu available. This final occasion, one persons meal came after 20 minutes and all the rest took an hour. For simple foods. We had to keep asking for cutlery but we’re only brought one set, we ended up sharing until they finally brought us cutlery."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Only Regular Customer should come?,negative,10,7/12/2015,"My family was at the restaurant this afternoon. Surprisingly this restaurant was only treated their regular guests with the warm hospitality. As we are the first timer we did not receive what a normal customer should receive. No staff take our order or served drink after sat down for more than 10 minutes, no change of plate, order was forgotten etc..."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap local food!,positive,40,28-Aug-13,"Excellent local food! Cheap if you don't mind the ambience. Beers are extremely cheap!

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good lunch set menu,negative,30,2-Jan-15,"I ate there with my wife and 4 year old child. We were there during lunch time within a festive week. It was quite easy getting a table. The whole place was pretty empty.Interestingly, the hostess seat us one table away from a couple having a meal and conversation. The whole place was empty and actually through out the meal I was a bit concerned about my son making noises and disturbing the couple. The hostess could have seated us better.The food is so-so. We ordered 3 entres. Only one of them the ""Duck Leg"" is delicious. We ordered Creme Brulee for desert and it doesn't taste nice at all.The overall environment is alright and the staff seems friendly and eager (although only two tables were occupied when we were there).I would come back again but only after I tried the other places nearby."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Had India vegetarian food,negative,30,3-Apr-15,Spent around 2 hours... the food was well cooked and tasty. The ambiance was good and it was not expensive. Had the feeling of India...
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Local food and fun,positive,40,17-Apr-13,"Hawker areas which frequent Singapore are great places to enjoy the local cuisine in a relaxed outdoor atmosphere. Newton Circus is only a short walk from the Newton MTR station. One word of caution – the food in hawkers is generally very reasonably priced except the large prawns and the chili crabs – Singapore specialities. All food is a stated fixed price except these items which are by weight. Make sure if you want these items, you ask for them to be weighed in front of you and ask what the total price will be. Many unsuspecting customers have been shocked by bills totalling several hundred dollars when they thought they were having a “cheap” meal. It is common for the weights to be exaggerated if you are not careful and have the items weighed in front of you. Do not let this detract from trying one of these areas though as everything else is really cheap and the food is amazing."
French,Paul,Pretentious,negative,30,4-Jun-17,"Went to grab a bite after some shopping, and was throughly disappointed by the service and more important the quality of the food served. For a patisserie, the bread and desert tasted pretty poor , average at best. Service was remarkably poor with staff not cleaning the previous dishes before serving the next one , even more disappointing as I prompted them.... When I got in, most of the tables were empty, but it seemed to fill shortly after with lots of families with children You would expect better service as this is not a cheap place If in the area I would look for better options "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for value-for-money dim sum high tea on weekdays.,positive,40,06/26/08,Great place for value-for-money dim sum high tea on weekdays.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Must Stop In Singapore,positive,40,20-Feb-14,Had a great time at this place. Too many choices and lots of repetition from food stall to food stall but the food is local and incredible. You've got to try the chili crab and giant prawns. Wow! Simply incredible.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Must do in Singapore,positive,40,8/6/2014,"This place was so good I went twice in 5 days. Originally taken as a guest of a local, we ordered the house specialty prawn (excellent dish), pork ribs and the famous black pepper crab. All meals were excellent but the crab lived up to the reputation... Went well with a nice cold jug of tiger.Atmosphere is very casual and relaxed and perfect for a warm evening - will be back. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,positive,40,9-Mar-16,"Restaurant staff was friendly and attentive. Food also arrived within minutes after placing order. However, the tablet used for placing orders was having some problems and we had to wait quite a while before we could order. Other than this overall was a good experience"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,negative,20,14-Sep-17,"Great food but really, what a rip off. Go to Whampoa Hawker once, and this place will feel like you're paying like a Michelin Star restaurant in London. This place is purely for tourists who want to say they've eaten like the Singaporeans do. It's probably 3 x more expensive than it should be. No Singaporeans eat here!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,You have to have the chilli crab!,positive,50,04/30/17,"Chilli Crab is the national dish of Singapore, and I know why - its fantastic.I can highly recommend Long Beach @ Dempsey as ""the place"" to get your fix of this soul food in Singapore.The starter courses are great, but don't fill up on them. Move right along to the main attraction. Although its called chilli crab, its not really that hot or spicy.The chilli crab is served with its shell pre-cracked so there is no need to use the nut crackers supplied - go for the claw which contains the best meat, but don't be shy to use the fried sweet buns supplied as a side dish to soak up the sauce. Chilli Crab: 94.00 Singapore Dollars - a bit pricy, but well worth the experience.We did not have space for the pepper crab, but there will definitely be a next time."
French,Paul,Promises Promises,negative,30,1-Jan-17,"Busy, understaffed, SLOW service.....the coffee was off, the meringues were hard and SOGGY, the matcha frappe was oversweet and odd, and you have to ASK, and ASK for a glass of water. Food does not show and any questioning is answered...you are in the queue. Indeed.Try somewhere else. The promise of standards like Paul elsewhere is...where?"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Expensive,negative,30,22-May-14,"This is one expensive restaurant in little India , to pay s$ 160 for food for four person is very expensive for an average restaurant. That's more than what one pay for 5 star hotel in India. Food is okay , their chats are good . Service is not like upmarket restaurant. overall avoid if have less budget for a restaurant."

Very good array of dishes to explore and their trade mark Ghee podi idly and dosai is mouth watering.
The thing that I did not like though was the rates listed...More"

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just brilliant,positive,40,10/27/15,"I knew that I loved this place after my first experience and I knew that I would be returning. Four visits and I still want more. That is four visits in three weeks!. If you like efficient staff, authentic food and a taste paradise then come here. You would usually order with pen and check boxes but sometimes they bring out the iPads which is fun. My few recommendations: get the brisket noodle. It is incredible. Any of the dim sum is also wonderful. My favourite is the steamed prawns. The Hong Kong won tons are very good too. My one disappointment was the signsture fat duck dumpling. Mostly rice and little duck. Of course I have to mention the duck. Excellent but it comes with the bones. So note that. Before I go home, I will be back. Come off peak, you will be waiting at peak hours for a minimum of an hour. 4pm for lunch and 8 pm for dinner are my suggestions."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Frozen beer,positive,50,16-Dec-13,When you go for a hawker style diner. you wont expect to get good service usually hawkers just give u want u ask for and mind their own business not here. when asked for a cold beer they gave me frozen beer which is extremely amazing to have at this warm climate at $7 for 640ml... who wants to leave..... the food all around is all great. though they have their sections cut out each respective stall has its own area.. i go here every month a universal place for every occasion..
French,Angelina_MBS,always high standard......,positive,50,23-Dec-16," we are here for a late lunch today. we've been to Angelina in Dubai many times. So when we found out that Singapore has one, we decided to dropby. i orderded my usual Wild Mushroom Risotto while the Mrs ordered her usual Pan Seared Red Snapper Fillet. The food here are always at its very high standard wherever or which ever Angelina you go... excellent!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch Buffet at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,positive,50,23-Oct-17,"Sashimi swordfish, octopus, tempura and pumpkin chawanmushi were good. Lesser variety for teppanyaki. Should have included free flow green tea in the buffet menu instead of charging it separately in the bill. Used the birthday voucher on that day."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Food,positive,40,29-Nov-17,"Kaislah Parbat has always been good though we still dont know if it is the same Kailash Parbat of Mumbai .. The food was lovely . We tried Dal Makhani and different types of parathas , kadhi chawal .. service is nice and ambience also decent"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,No place better for chinese food,positive,50,5/6/2012,"We used to frequent Crystal Jade when we lived in Hong Kong and I was delighted that they are as popular a chain in Singapore as well. They have many different formats for their restaurants, ranging from the regular dining experience to formats which are slightly more expensive and better done up. The food remains consistently good whenever we go, and therefore this remains our first choice when we want to eat good cantonese food. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food centre,positive,40,12-Mar-18,"Newton was easy to get to from the train and well laid out. We went for lunch on Monday so quiet a few were closed but had some great Chinese bbq, Satays and Indian food good value and quality. Would be better when more stalls are open so worth the trip would be good at night "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Skip it,negative,20,01/26/15,"Overall this one deserves sad applause, winning no category of service, quality. Cost, taste or ambience. The place is hidden in Chinatown and gives somewhat of an impression that you might find a gem located in the hustle of it all. So up a narrow staircase and excitement brews but alas a big hall, no music and bold bright light. We enter and get pointed to a table fairly promptly and were thinking ""the food should be good since there are a lot of review of the place that speaks to it"". So we rush to call for menus and order too much so we can give a whole bunch of things a try.First comes the vegetables. Vegetarian they say and sprinkled with the usual dose of unnecessary shrimp. Next the fried rice then dumplings etc. dish after dish waiting for something to write home to. Unfortunate I can't say a single one. The service was fairly prompt but never with a smile. The price...hefty for Chinatown. I would carefully reconsider if you want to go here. It's simply not worth it and there are far far better options in Chinatown. Skip it and save yourself the attempt to prove me wrong. "
French,Saveur,Slow service,negative,10,12-Mar-17,"We got in at around 6:50pm on a Friday evening. We ordered our food quickly, before the crowd got in. We have got our main dish (duck confit) only around 7:20pm. In the meantime, the couple at the next table got in after us, got their main dish (duck confit and beef), and had almost finished eating by the time we got our food. We asked the waiting staff to check a few times, and each time they claimed that our food was being prepared.BTW, the chope voucher can only be used for a la carte items. Can't use for set menus."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE,positive,40,12/21/12,"We went to this Restarant in a group of about 100 people. It's obviously a very popular Restaurant for Tourists and locals alike, because there was lots of people waiting to get in. Aside from that the food and service is very good. Their speciality is Dim Sum served in typical Cantonese style. We had a fixed menu and all the dishes was very tasty if you like that type of food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another cool food hall,positive,40,30-Aug-15,"Okay, this is basically another food hall, but as I have suggested previously I really do love these places, so when I got of the MRT at Newton to visit some place else (Sarkies Road) I decided to step in here and have a look around. Okay, I'm not sure if there is anything in Newton that would attract the average tourist (a category that I generally don't fall into) but the food hall is certainly worth a visit. There are plenty of stalls to chose from, though most of them were closed when I was here (which probably had something to do with the time of day). Still, there was enough available for me to partake in some of the goodies."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local food centre,positive,40,5-Jun-17,"Still a place for tourists. Mostly seafood stalls. Quite difficult to find place to sit unless you order food from that particular stall, the stall people will help you find a place."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Unique experience,positive,50,19-May-15,"This was one of the best dinner I have ever had!In the beginning it was difficult to find the place. You need to take an elevator, which is somewhat hidden to level 4 the atrium. Make sure you know where it is.Once you are there it is a special, sophisticated atmosphere. The service is high class Asian style, which from my point of view is much better than western type. It makes the guest feel very special and is never annoying.Going into the separe you are seated at a big counter in front of the teppan grill, where we were in total four people. Even it is a counter, there is much space and privacy. We were seated with two other people, but we still felt comfortable.And now the food, the reason why you should go to this place, it was outrageous, just unique! A 10 course menu, mainly seafood, just one Kobe beef dish, but definitely great. It's a mix of Japanese and high European cuisine. The dishes build up well. The highlight, which are many, were the signatory dish, raw botan shrimp, sea urchin and oscietra caviar. New Zealand scampi with gnocchi, so pure and delicious. Tasmanian abalone with a type of risotto. My favourite, slowly braised Canadian lobster. It was so tender and the sauce to deep in complexity, this was one of the best dishes I ever had, and the best lobster I have ever eaten. The taste of slowly cooked made it so special, besides the quality obviously. Incredible! The Kobe beef was served with fresh wasabi from the root, very special, I never had this before.And the desert were very good as well, it is served in another area with nice views on the marinha bay. For drinks, as usual in Singapore, alcohol is expensive. Instead of having four glasses of wine for a hundred dollar, you should take a full bottle for the same price. There is a good choice, we took a new zeeland white wine, there was only one. I like the mineral taste of this type and it was good.This was a definitively expensive experience, but worthwhile the full experience. If you can afford it, and you like high quality seafood you will be overwhelmed in this place. Go there! Next time I am in Singapore I will make sure to return. A unique experience, with world class seafood!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Pepper and Chilli Crab in town,positive,40,10/1/2014,"Having eaten at quite a few famous crab restaurants in SGP, i have picked the Long Beach Dempsey's Chilli and Pepper crab dishes as the best among those i have tried.Their 'house special Prawns' is a must try and so is the garlic baby kailan.The presentation of the Mango and Durian puddings looks better than they taste, even with them tasting pretty decent.Def will go again..Visited this place like a 100 times with the most recent being in Aug 2014."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cheap and good,positive,40,13-Dec-15,Sashimi is really good . Atmosphere is alright because our seats were in the corner like near the exit so it's kinda weird . But overall experience was ok. The staff is really nice as well. Good comes fast.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Deserves even more stars,positive,50,20-Jan-17,If I could give a sushi restaurant 10 stars this would be the place --innovative tasty and as much as you can eat in one meal. Best sushi I have had anywhere on the globe
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great Indian food,positive,40,29-Jan-15,"Nice location, good choice of tasty dishes and cold beer. Whilst the service isnt the best Muthu's is a good place to enjoy an authentic Indian meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place!!,positive,50,18-Oct-16,"The food is amazing. Lots of fun and the food is great. Lots of stalls. Try lots of things. The stingray is good, but be sure to scrape it sideways instead of trying to cut into it to avoid the bones. Great food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check out Denmark Seafood #49,positive,50,9-Sep-13,"Asked a local cab driver to take us to somewhere to eat good crab, and he bought us to the Newton Hawker Centre. After being hassled by several very pushy restaurant touters, we started speaking to San from Denmark Seafood who was friendly, polite & great to deal with.We had chilli crab, black pepper crab, tiger prawns that are bigger than your hand & some greens, and a few tiger beers for good measure. We left full & satisfied, and for a lot less than we paid at no signboard seafood the night before."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"First class food, First class service",positive,50,08/20/17,"Celebrated my mother in law's birthday here. 9 course dinner starting with the prosperity buns and ended with an amazing desert of coconut ice cream, coconut shavings, mango pudding. The vermicelli was something, as was the fish cooked in their home made sauce. Haven't had any of these dishes before this evening and I'd recommend anyone going there to check it out. To top it off, you won't find an even more attentive service crew, coupled with a Chinese rendition of a birthday poem for my mother in law at the end of our dinner. Thank you Alden, Terry, Sok Teng, Sun Jing and Christine. And thank you marina mandarin!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and chips,positive,40,17-Jan-17,"This is a small place, but if you want a great steak and chips then look no further. The meal was delicious, cooked to perfection and I could easily go back for more. My friend and I did not experience any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned - we were served well, and ate at our leisure. The whole Duxton Hill area was really nice too. It has a really relaxed atmosphere with a huge variety of restaurants and bars with flavours and options from all over the world. Would like to explore more."
French,Saveur,Don't waste your time at this terrible restaurant,negative,10,3-Nov-14,"The kitchen staff started taking off their aprons, which triggered us to follow up on our mains. We then saw them put on their aprons again and started cooking! When we asked the waiter if they had forgotten about our order and what turned us off is that he blatantly lied that the kitchen staff was very busy. Ya right. The food was a complete disappointment - the aglio tasted was soaked in oil and tasted salty, like everyone other dish that we ordered. The duck confit looked like a piece of overnight duck thrown into the microwave. This restaurant is a complete disaster and I totally regretted my visit into this nightmare restaurant wannabe. A far cry from Saveur, and a total disgrace. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent choice for having Indian Chaat. EXPENSIVE,positive,40,16-May-17,"Evenings are always crowded. Way too expensive. Masala Chai is my personal favorite here. Sev Poori, vegetable handi are my favorites."

French,Poulet,French Roasted Chicken - worth the try!,positive,40,17-Jun-14,"Noticed this restaurant in several places, finally took the effort to try it at Westgate. Since roast chicken was their signature dish, I ordered a half portion for myself. You can choose Chardonnay sauce (which I had) or cranberry. Staff was attentive even though it was on a friday evening. Waiting time was reasonable. Chicken was cooked yet moist. The sauce had a nice balanced flavour to it, although I think some may think it a bit salty to taste.Tried the mash potato as a side, very creamy and enjoyable. Worth the try if you love chicken or just want to have french food at reasonable price."
French,L_Angelus,White Asparagus ,positive,50,24-Apr-18,"Walked in for a business lunch, we got a good sized table. It had the upscale ambience that was conducive to good conversation. Had the snapper which was terrific. my friend was vegetarian and got a special menu which was a good suprise at a proper French restaurant. White asparagus was a delight.Great red wine list including some verticals, though being lunch we did not imbibe. Will be back"

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Smooth Duck Specialty,positive,40,9/6/2016,"Specialized in roasted duck. The rice is normal while the noodle is specially thin that can either flow through or stuck in the gaps between the teeth. The duck is smooth and soft and the skin roasted to perfect crispy texture.The signature side dishes include London duck buns with pepper or original flavour, crispy shrimp dumplings and steamed cheong fun. My personal pick is the pepper London duck bun coated with black pepper adding spicy flavour to the outer bun which upon ""bitten"" ""secreted"" juicy sauce enclosing small bits of duck meat."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great variety of Dim Sum,positive,40,01/17/15,"We didn't have to wait for too long to be seated. They gave us Chinese menu and never came back for the order. We didn't know the waitors would come with dim sum trolley. We just had to point and speak. But our table was in the corner where the waitors didn't seem to notice we were there. A bit unorganized service, ortherwise, great variety of delicious food!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Black Pepper Crab,positive,40,4/5/2011,This was my second visit to Long Beach (last one being in August 2010) and I was not disappointed. I came for the Chili Crab & the Black Pepper Crab and I've decided I like the Black Pepper Crab better. The crabmeat was so sweet and not over powered by the seasoning.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great fun!,positive,40,26-Aug-12,"This is a must visit. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. Lots of choice, worth a wonder round to see everything on offer. Pick a table, then go buy your drinks and food. Top tip: agree a price before ordering anything priced on weight. Try the chili crab, peppered squid, and the jumbo prawns."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Another place for fin shark...,negative,20,05/14/16,"The place is like a factory, so busy.Staff have no time to give any attention as they are running all over the place. Very busy.Dim sum are great, tasty but unfortunately one more place that don't give sh... about the shark fin awful trade and offer shark fin dim sum on their menu.Not recommended at all."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Its okay.. not worth the money,negative,30,27-Dec-17,"Paid $72.74 per pax with gst and service charge with green tea. Original price was $59.90++ during this ""festive"" period. Beverages needed to be top up separately. Went on Xmas Eve, restaurant was only 60% full, we were there from 7pm to 9pm. Its an ala-carte buffet, serving speed was ok. Salmon sashimi was quite fresh. Maki has too much rice, hence dont order too much. Yaki dishes, my friends love. Edamame was served hot, strangely. Mentaiko spaghetti was bland, dont try. Zaru soba was soggy, dont try. Chawanmushi was good, try it. Complimentary snow crab served was good. thank you. Good to try on non-festive periods, but still on the pricier side, wont go again. "
French,Saveur,Good French food at reasonable prices,positive,40,25-Nov-17,"I prefer the ambience of the Far East Plaza outlet; this one kind of felt like a cafeteria and didn't have have a very cosy or luxe feel. That aside, the food was fine dining standards - but reasonably priced - and was consistent with other outlets. Really enjoyed the new Egg Confit which was creamy and had a noticeable truffle flavour."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food exhibition ,positive,40,15-Dec-17,Newtons hawker center hasn't changed much in the past 20years.. the food quality is very good and there are plenty of options to choose from.. since most of the seating is outdoor / it can be inconvenient when it rains.. will be back some day..
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good sefood,positive,40,03/30/16,A good place for some authentic Chinese seafood a good menu that caters for all types. we were there for a quick business lunch.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crabs! Crabs!! Crabs!!!,positive,40,07/27/15,"Wonderful local Singapore fare. Had some fresh coconut juice to start then some amazing black pepper crab, chili crab, prawns, and local chicken. Veggies were amazing as well. Lovely dessert of a yam soup and fresh fruit. Make reservations as it gets packed. Sat outside and the breeze was wonderful. Plan on using your hands and being ok with that. Makes eating much easier so if you're ""above"" that sort of thing this isn't for you. Plenty of water bowls and wipes. Very attentive service and great food. "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent couscous royal,positive,40,28-Nov-15,"Went to Les Bouchons chiefly for its couscous royal n it turned out to be excellent.

French,Saveur,"Good food, not so good service",negative,30,19-Dec-16,"The food was good as usual, but the service, not so great. It felt like they didn't know what they were doing. 5 of us ordered set meals, but we only got 2 out of the 5 drinks and 1 out of the 4 desserts we ordered. Every time we asked for them, the staff would punch it into the system like it was an additional order before bringing it. Needless to say the bill was all wrong. Had to do the correction for them, the cashier had to print the bill 5 times before she got it right. "
French,Paul,Pauls (Tanglin Mall),negative,10,19-Jun-14,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. We had lunch and it was over-priced, the food was very so so, and a the waiter was so rude (from start to finish). They had a basket of bread on the table and we ate a few pieces. I ask for a bag to take the leftover bread home. The waiter rudely told me no this is not possible as it is free while you are in the restaurant only. So we ask - so you reuse this bread and he replied no we throw it away. I don't believe a restaurant would be so wasteful. I think they reuse the bread in the basket which is absolutely disgusting. I will not eat there again and do not recommend it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quality local food,positive,40,12-Jul-15,"If you are after an e prince of local food and cheap prices you can not go past Newtons Hawkers Markets in the evenings. There is a large selection of local foods. Do t be stressed out by the pressure of dome hawkers wanting you to sit at there tables to eat you can mix and match. Ethereal were 8 of us and we all got our meals and a couple of beers and soft drinks for $60 total there is a large variety to choice from, I found this to be one of the cheaper quality eateries in Si galore, a taxi should not cost you more then $20 from the central part of Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great restaurant for Japanese ala-carte buffet,positive,40,26-Aug-17,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant is a wonderful place to go to with friends and/or family. Ordering via a tablet was easy to use, and the food came rather promptly after we sent our order. The food was fresh, I especially loved the Salmon sashimi and skewers. Good value for money! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Some tasty dimsum, average not great",negative,30,01/26/16,"THE GOOD:Some interesting dim sumCheapTHE NOT SO GOOD:Toilets are disgustingCheung fun blandWe ate here for lunch and the food was okay, nothing special I thought. You need to be aware that if you don't eat peanuts or use the wet towels they will charge you for it.The squid ink dim sum was tasty and was our favourite. Although the cheung fun was very bland and only had two prawns in them. Service was okay, my biggest gripe was the state of the toilets. They were absolutely disgusting. The staff or patrons obviously use it for smoking but not only that, the toilet seat was smeared with brown all over it. Really ruined our visit."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Looking for Veggie in Singapore? Go for this.,positive,40,28-Jan-15,"We have visited this restaurant twice during our short visit to Singapore.

The food were served fresh and right temperature.
Had a great and full lunch at Shin Minori on my birthday!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Warm welcome, good food",positive,50,18-Mar-12,"For simple bistro food, notably steaks (a wide range), prawns, frites, vegetables, salads and desserts, this could be a welcome change after an excess of fish-head curry, pepper crab, noodles and beer. Set in the quiet of Robertson Quay, just a few minutes' walk from the bustle of Clarke Quay, it offers an elegant ambiance and well-cooked plain food. There is an excellent wine list, including a wide selection of mainly French reds and whites and with big-name champagne at remarkably modest prices for Singapore. There is a terrace overlooking the river as well as the air-conditioned interior. Service for our visit was impeccable, with owner Sam providing welcome advice on the different cuts of steak and the wine list."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Birthday Treat,positive,40,15-Oct-17,Food was yummy and service was good. Food came piping hot and fresh. I gave it a 4/5 because there is no desert on the menu. Otherwise would have been a perfect 5.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrific dim sum - great location,positive,40,11/22/13,This is one of my favorite places for a weekend breakfast of dim sum. I highly recommend you go early (9ish) because the place fills up quickly. The quality of their dim sum is great. The staff are always hustling around to bring the food to the diners. Don't be shy or you'll miss an opportunity for your fave dim sum to go to another diner!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),No quality for the money,negative,20,04/21/13,I try to avoid to eat in hotels because the menu there is usually limited and prices high. In cause of Peach Blossom in Marina Mandarin it works - the prices are exorbitant and the food quality is average comparing to the Singapore in the whole.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Appalling Service,negative,10,3/1/2016,"Food was alright, no wow factor. We were truly disappointed with the service, rude and unreliable. I also ordered take away however they missed out a few items on the list but yet I was charged for the dimsum. And when I returned a couple of days later to claim the missing items, the service staff was not happy. Did not even apologise!Extremely poor service!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Horrible stink,negative,10,26-Oct-16,"What u don't expect as u enter a restaurant is horrible stink.. is the owner totally ignorant! Can't believe it!
I know that their food is good - have eaten at the outlet on Serangoon road near the temple - surely much better.."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,The jury is out,negative,30,09/25/16,"@TheKuoKnowsI am in two minds about London Fat Duck. On the one hand the Roast Duck was quite superb. But on the other hand, the price seems a little steep at 48 bucks for a whole bird.That said, the duck was exquisite. A tasty skin enveloped a meaty duck"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food and service,positive,40,04/23/16,Same names for all the dim sum dishes I have eaten all over the world. Here the dishes are not as oily. Some of the same name dishes made a little different but all great. Place does need a major update and lift needs to be fixed.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not sure if it is worth,negative,30,10-Dec-11,"I visited shinji on mid November. It has nice authentic decor with beautiful wooden counter. We order omakase. Entire experience was ok but I just simply felt painful when I paid the bill (nearly $600). Of course with this price it should be good quality but I ususally concern the cost performance and it makes me feel not worth for it. As I mentioned it was ok. Food is good, Service honestly so so, ambience very good. I believe this price range should show something special and wow theguest. Just it doesn't make me feel happy after the meal like everybody commented and make me feel to come back. If I am rich, it doesn't matter but I rather recommend to go to Japan and have same quality in more reasonable price even pay for the air ticket."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice local foodfare,negative,30,15-Jan-13,"NIce spread of local food, but for foreigners, please beware of the cheaters there, who tend to hike up their charges when they sense tourist presence. Make sure you ask the price before ordering!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,As good as Jumbo if not better...,positive,40,03/25/12,"The bet is on. Longbeach or Jumbo serves the best pepper crabs? Either way, customers WIN. Long Beach has a more laxed feel when you eat as its dining areas are in the main aircon restaurant, on the verandah (outdoor but with a roof) or just below the verandah (outdoor in brollies). Going to dinner give your guests a feel of working up an appetite as they climb up the little hill of about 30 steps. Thanks."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Terrible, this is",negative,10,12/26/13,"Me and my family had to wait for very long. Toilet is dirty, the supervisor is rude and generally i will not come back again"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Elevated my standards ,positive,50,14-Nov-15,Shinji elevated my standards of what to expect for a premium Omakase. At these prices (300SGD/person) there is a high likelihood of being let down. There was not a single flaw. Each very attentively prepared and served piece better than its weaker versions I have had in LA. You won't be let down
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic South Indian food and super quick service,positive,40,21-Sep-13,"Place is always super crowded and has some waiting time... but worth the wait if looking out for some authentic south indian foods such as idli, dosa, vada, etc... service is super quick too and runs like a factory sending out dosas by the minute....More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food was good but the ""cleaning lady"" from the kitchen spoilt the entire experience for us.",negative,20,15-Feb-17,"Food was above average and commendable. As was the service given the entire network crashed. It took a half hour before staff efficiently managed ""manually"". we were impressed with how they managed the situation. The evening was a completely loss when the cleaning lady form the kitchen pushed out a trolley load of trash bags and asked me to move. I was seated and still having my dinner. I asked what she meant in disbelief and she shouted in mandarin ""move away."" my partner was so taken aback he stood up and insisted we leave immediately. Sadly, i did not get to finish my dinner. Not quite acceptable."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",VFM!,positive,40,28-Aug-14,VALUE FOR MONEY! Spoilt for choice. The street food is safe n hygienic. Cool place to catch up with friends for an informal eve of unashamed gluttony

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't feel welcomed.,negative,10,15-Jul-17,". i had been to this restaurant 2 times & I always had a good impression. But this time round I simply feel like I am not welcomed. i had made reservation for 1.30pm. last order is at 2pm, & closes at 2.30pm. when I reach at 1.45pm, your staff said last order in 8mins? Ok fine, I agreed & walked in with the lady. While the lady was showing me to the table, she commented ""why can't you come another day? "" ""why don't I come another day""? Fine I won't come again. The price of your buffet is not cheap & this is the kind of customer service you are giving. Please reflect on your service. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Not fantastic,negative,30,24-Feb-16,The hotchocolate here is good. I think they use some real chocolate chunks mixed with cream or milk because from my table I could see the bartender mixing it up. Apart from that this place is a little expensive and the food is regular.

Prices are higher than Japan."
French,Paul,Pastry dessert not as tasty but Steak was good,negative,30,19-Mar-14,"Went with colleagues last evening for dinner at Paul's Takashimaya (Halal restaurant, went with muslim colleagues). Service staff seemed untrained and didn't have the proper knowledge to make recommendations. Drinks was pricey at $7.50 for Lemon iced tea (just a slice of lemon and has a bitter taste). Desserts we had was a strawberry tart (not as good as we thought) and chocolate part (texture was very dry)We ordered a main course Steak medium well for me that was the only saving grace for this restaurant, pretty good tender steak that I would recommend. For the price we paid, I think we were only paying for the parisian decor."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Not good,negative,10,3-Oct-18,"service was slow, inconsistent and err0r prone. Food on bufftet had been standing around for too long, even at 6PM. Waiter then messed up order for a la cart food"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very nice Dim Sum lunch,positive,40,10/21/17,"We enjoyed a nice Dim Sum lunch. The best Chinese we have visited during our 2 week trips, we were surprised by the generally poor quality of food or the extremely high price for average food, so it was nice to find a restaurant were we enjoyed the meal.Not a budget conscious restaurant, half a dozen dishes cost more than $100 Singapore dollars.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoyable experience,positive,40,23-Sep-15,"This is safe street food Singapore style. There is a little bit of hustle from the vendors, but too be honest I have had a lot worse in the past. Plenty of food choices, reasonable prices for SG. All three of us ate from different stall holders and a good was quickly delivered to our tables. Worthy of a visit and if you fancy street food then you know you will be safe here."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",NORTH INDIAN CUISINE,negative,30,24-Jul-15,Kailash Parbat speciality is Main North Indian as well as snack dishes .It is generally well cooked & presented prompmptly .Indian Sweets are also available in the Restauarant.Restauarant Ambience & seating is well done . Size of portions in various dishes is rather meagre & just enough for two people which makes it a little costly. Also one has to carefully place order & recheck as there ia a chance of mixing orders .
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummmm,positive,50,12-Jun-17,Such an enjoyable dining experience in Singapore. Something different than the overpriced and boring food found in the shopping areas.I've heard that tourists get a different price to locals. But the price is so good that it didn't worry us.And they have beer towers!!

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worthwhile buffet!,positive,40,29-Aug-16,"went to try out using the entertainer 1-for-1. Location is a little inconvenient for me as I had to walk from Clarke Quay station under the sun, but luckily it was worthwhile. Sashimi was fresh and thickly sliced :)Selection of sushi and yakitori was good. "
French,Paul,Poor service,negative,20,9-Aug-17,"We enjoy trying out different cafes around Singapore, and this place has got one of the worst service crew around. What a shame considering the food is actually fairly decent.One particular male staff (could not capture the name but tall and large build) has one of the poorest attitude ever. We were seated for 10mins without being served, so we raised we raised our hands to send him a signal, and got a stonecold look from him. When we were placing our order, he was inpatient and rude throughout.Then, a lady in the next table asked the same staff of her food, he got very defensive in explaining ""everyone is very busy, so you have to wait"". Eventually the lady was served with a rather grumpy look. We could hear the entire conversation plainly because the staff was loud in his response to that poor lady."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An okay dining experience,negative,30,14-Aug-18,"The restaurant was easy to find while the ambiance was rather dated and tired. Staff was attention quick to clear dishes and refresh drinks. The sashimi was fresh and good, so was the maki and yakitori sticks in general. However some of the main dishes were very average and did not inspire us to even finish some of the dishes. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Reliable good curry dishes at Muthu's.,positive,50,18-Sep-16,Great location and place to have a good curry meal. The restaurant is clean and very reasonable price for the quality of the food. We rate Muthu's as one of our favorite Indian curry restaurant.

When we were being seated, they told us ""we have run out of Sri Lankan crabs"", implying there were other shellfish but when we were ordering, they didn't have anything at all, not even lobster! If we had known there was no shellfish, we would have gone somewhere else!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food for cheap,positive,40,11-Jan-14,You can get good and local food but there.It has probably more than a hundred food stalls there so you have a lot to choose from.But dont make the same mistake as us and go there for lunch. A lot of the stalls will still be closed by then since people go therer for dinner.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Disappointing,negative,30,13-Mar-17,Both idly and dosa were not up to the Murugan Chennai standards. The service was quick but the quality wasn't good.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great disappointment ,negative,30,01/30/16,"I was looking forward to a great meal but was utterly disappointed. Lohei was not nice. The baby abalone, in place of salmon,tasted fishy. The bamboo clams were ok. The cereal baby lobsters were a bit too salty. The black pepper crab were too spicy. The clams were to appetizing. The fried rice tasted bland. Only saving grace was the dessert. I don't know what happen to them. Last year, I was still enjoying. Even their fried rice were tasty. It's a great disappointment for a place so well known and so pricey, "

However the price of the food has sure gone up, when 5 years ago, the duck confiti used to cost $8.90 as compared to $14.90 now. Also, the place seemed understaff with only 3 service crew for 2 floors. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome genuine veg snacks,positive,50,16-Jul-17,"Most genuine veg snacks like papdi chat , paneer tikka, samosa , seekh kabab veg available . Main course is awesome too. Located just opposite to Mustafa complex gate 2. The place inside is little congested. Suggested them to offer wifi access to tourists."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi,positive,50,3-Oct-18,"I have been to most Japanese restaurants in Singapore and i've been to Shinji several times, it is simply D best in my opinion. the service is impeccable, the ingredient used are of good quality and its sushi taste great. Although its on the higher end of the price scale, its worth at least one visit especially for special occasions."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of Food,positive,40,11-Apr-17,"value for money and there is a wide selection of food, gd to visit. drinks however are not included in the buffet price.."
French,Saveur,Amazing Food always,positive,40,27-Jun-16,"The food is without a question, great. Portion is also generous. But my wishlist will be that recommendations and slight enthusiasm will be great."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),POOR SERVICE & FOOD,negative,20,1/7/2017,"Shared a business lunch for r. Out of the seven or so courses we shared, only one was really good. Service was not attentive--each of us took turns pouring tea. At end of meal, waiters moved in a table to set it up? Very uncouyh."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,negative,30,14-Apr-17,"Drinks not inclusive, per pax is $45 after all the miscellaneous charges, not worth for the limited variety of food choices available for buffet. Food not as fantastic as reviewed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",UOB card 1 for 1,positive,40,12-Aug-16,The food was of good quality. Reservations were made via Chope and it was easy to use & confirmation was prompt. Staff were very proactive & attentive to customers needs. Very pleasant dining experience ??????????
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Changes menu a lot,negative,30,07/16/15,"I've been to Crystal Jade in Holland Village 5 times in the past 3 years. It is usually crowded during lunch time, when the air-conditioned room upstairs is open. They close it after 2 or 3pm, when it is less crowded and you'll have to dine downstairs (no air-conditioning, fans only). Food quality of dim sum (dumplings, congee etc) is good and authentic, close to what you'd get in dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. We liked their seafood fried cheongfun/horfun. Service was average during lunch hours (when they are busiest), slightly better later in the afternoon. I did find myself feeling abnormally thirsty after my most recent trip in July 2015, possibly due to increased MSG levels in the food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Central,positive,40,21-Nov-12,"Probably 70 stalls selling fresh seafood can't be beat. Butter Prawns, pepper crab, grilled tiger prawns, the list goes on. If you don't like seafood probably not the place for you."

Many compliments were given for their food quality and taste (Peach Blossom) and not forgetting to mention their excellent customer service. We look forward to come back again. Thank you."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",An unforgettable dinner prepared by chef Masaya Suzuki,positive,50,13-Sep-15,I love Japanese food. And I particularly like sea urchin. So when I found out about a Japanese restaurant that incorporates sea urchin into its signature dish I had to try it.The restaurant is located in the Marina Bay Sands complex and one of the dele rity chef restaurants. I enjoyed the 10 course omakase menu prepared by chef Suzuki Right in front of me and 4 other guests - particularly the sea urchin signature dish. I was also introduced to a delicious sake from the Masuizumi brewery's platinum collection. I have never tasted such a smooth and well balanced sake before.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth a visit,negative,30,16-Mar-13,"Regarded as a tourist venue with 'expensive' hawker food, for most visitors it will be more than a worthwhile visit and not deemed expensive. It has certainly become more ' established' than when last there some twenty two years ago.There are plenty of other hawker venues that are more authentic and cheaper...but was happy to go with friends who had never been."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Our Very Own Kailash Parbat,positive,40,5-Feb-18,"This is a brand in India so taste was never gonna be a problem , but sorry guys your outlet at Colaba still rocks the best ... n highly priced ... though enjoyed the food"

When the restaurant first newly opened in Mbs we visited the restaurant was wayu beef steak served for each guest, after the restaurant got Michelle Star we were back to this restaurant again due to we missed n love foods to our surprised was such a disappointment the wayu beef steak became a slice of beef each guest. Menu remained the same, price the same but amt of beef is cut down. N during payment time, they asked whether we have Mbs memberships card, which I told them I had registered few months ago but I haven’t collect the physical card frm the mbs Customer service n i told them I hav ecard in my phone but the staff insisted she wanted the physical mbs Memberships card , without the physical card she cannot credit the points, which was kind of disappointed. Few days later I went to Mbs Customer Service counter to collect my card n told them about the incident I had in waku ghin , the staff in waku ghin requested me to show them my physical card then can credit points so the Mbs customer service staff actually told me show e card memberships frm the phone also can credit points. After hearing my incident the mbs customer service staff requested me to let them photo copy the receipt to help me appeal . Unfortunately, waku ghin refused to credit back those points. This is a so call 1 Michelin Star Service "

An incredible experience, the best restaurant we have dined in and that includes 2 & 3 Star Michelin."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointment,negative,30,11-Sep-16,Had been to this restaurant many times but it was such a disappointing experience on 9/9/16.The love apple dessert ordered was totally different from the picture on the menu and it taste horrible. My friends also ordered the Green Tea Cheese Cake and it also tasted horrible. Would not recommend my friends there again. 
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Heavenly idlis and chutney :),positive,50,29-Jun-15,"This is the one of best places in Singapore to try South Indian fare, and my personal favourite. The idlis and the cocount chutney are out of this world! Even the ghee and butter dosas are damn good. Two thumbs up!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This place is great! So cheap and great food.,positive,50,7-Aug-14,"We went here with friends who are living in Singapore and took us here. Wow, the atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious, tasty and cheap. Make sure you try the stingray and carrot cake (not not actual carrot cake but made with eggs, some sort of dumpling thing, not sure what else but yum). It's authentic, local foods, service is excellent. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food is great! Better book and arrive earlier so that orders come fast!,positive,40,26-May-17,"Sashimi is fresh,
There is enough items on the menu for kids!
Generally satisfied and service is OK!
Will definitely be back!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Just OK,negative,30,26-Oct-17,Went there for breakfast. The pastries and the scrambled eggs were quite nice. So was the fresh orange juice. The hot chocolate was delicious but very rich. The fruit salad turned out to be from a can topped with some blueberries and a strawberry. The service was nice and prompt. I did not like the atmosphere - either you sit in a dark spot downstairs or upstairs where it all looks scrambled together. Overall value for money regarding breakfast is better elsewhere.
French,L_Angelus,"Good food, well done",positive,40,31-Mar-16,"Set up brasserie style, it's a good solid menu of traditional french favorites. Prices are a little steep, but the quality is evident from the moment you arrive. Foie Gras perfectly done, an amazing veal chop and a good solid wine list to choose from. Great cheese selection as well. Happy to recommend. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious,positive,40,3/2/2016,Food was excellent... Loved the Roasted pork and duck.. moist and tasty! I ordered a Congee with pork liver and it was delicious as well. Loved the food at this restaurant! But the only reason they don't get a full 5/5 rating is because of the not so friendly staff. Even though the food they served kind of made up for it but still... service is probably the most important thing they should be upholding in a restaurant. Nonetheless... great food!
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Overpriced food,negative,30,2-Mar-16,I have visited riverwalk tandoor twice at clarke quay and once at rangoon road and it doesn't fail to disappoint me in one way or the other.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yummy crab, shelled for you",positive,50,11/3/2014,"Serving 500 pax every night, this restaurant is pumping out crab dishes left, right and centre. It's busy, but the service is fast and friendly. We picked this crab restaurant over the others because they will shell it for you- meaning it's not as messy as usual! Lazy, perhaps, but worth it as I don't like eating crab to feel like a work out. The manager showed off the Alaskan crabs (at $800SG a pop), but we settled on a Sri Lankan version. Worth a visit- it's not fancy, but it's a lot of fun. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Restaurant near Mustafa,positive,50,14-May-16,Very nice restaurant.. Its not a big place.. service is good. food is also good.. North and South Indian both food taste is awesome.. almost all variety of food.. staff is humble.. Best for Jain food.. I recomend this Restaurant

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum craze!,positive,50,03/30/13,"I loved this place. The more the merrier! Not the most straight forward way to find the entrance, but clear enough. Once up on the 2nd Floor, you get welcomed by... people queuing! But do not give up, because the turn-over rate is factory-like and you will be seated in no time. I think I waited 10 or 15 min once, but it is worth it! A woman cruise by to note down how many of you will be eating (that's how the queue never stays long enough for you to complain, usually). You get to your table and get served straight away some Jasmine tea, and then either trollies or waitresses zig-zag between tables to present you their freshly steamed or fried dishes. The waitresses then tick the boxes on the receipt that lives on the table. Generally you will end up with a USD 20 note per person, and that is for a full belly! I only tried the Dim Sum and other buns, but it had became my Sunday ritual and I recommend it to whoever stops in Singapore long enough to visit this restaurant.Ho, and please try the mango Sago. It's a liquid mango dish with clear rice beads, and it is soooo refreshing. Do get rebutted by its appearance, and try it!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best experience in Japanese restaurant,positive,50,20-Sep-11,"This was my second visit to Shinji. First time was Jan 2011.The food quality was maintained at its highest standard.Dinner only have 3 menu aside from that so long as you can name it and they have the ingredient, they will custom made for you. Especially for my small children.I still remember when we first stepped into Shinji main entrance, the waitress asked us ""Do you have reservation?"" We said no. She said, ""Sorry our Sushi counter is full!"" Funny... In Malaysia we always reserves for private room but why in Shinji the regulars only book their Sushi counter?This trip we booked our Sushi counter seats and realized that it was a great enjoyment having dinner at the Sushi counter!We enjoyed watching the Sushi master, Kokuchi San who has 14 years of preparing Sushi and Sashimi experience in Tokyo, Osaka and Indonesia, prepared our food and it was an art... So amazing.Mr. Kokuchi not only explained to us why certain fish or seafood had to prepared in particular ways, he also shared his life experience with us. We were like having dinner in an old friend's house, exchanging our experiences.Only thing I have to highlight that is if you choose to dine in Shinji, don't expect you can have high quality food with cheap or reasonable prices. They are real expansive!It is very very expansive compare to what we can have in Malaysia.It cost us about RM4000 for a dinner of 4 adults and 2 children.BUT it is a life time experience. You shall never miss it if you are affordable.We sure will return to Shinji if we travel to Singapore again.Thank you Kokuchi San for making super mini tamago sushi for my daughter and super mini tamago hand rolls for my son."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good restaurant: Does what it says on the tin!,positive,40,4-Sep-13,"We arrived without booking and were asked to wait a few minutes outside with a drink while they got a table ready. The place is is a nice area and has local charm. I can't say that the lady Maitre D' (Maitresse D'?) was effusive with her welcome but my goodness, she was briskly efficient and the serving team were well drilled. Once seated, we had our order taken immediately - not hard, they do steak and frites only - and there was a glass of wine in my hand within seconds. Just what I needed. The food arrived very quickly: The meat was perfectly cooked, flavoursome and tender too, the sauce rich without being overpowering and the fries were not over-salted. The portions were generous; I couldn't eat all of the meal. Good value for money. Very happy indeed and would return."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Average Indian cuisine,negative,30,8-Dec-12,"OK for the taste of food but not very tasty to me. The staff was also not friendly though I saw them joking with some customers who are foreigners. The price is also quite expensive and for that price, I would rather go for some...More"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Omakase,positive,50,27-Feb-16,Waku Ghin definitely is one of the top Japanese resto in Singapore. Located on the 3rd floor of MBS casino. The seafood cooking is fantastic. The dessert also super felicious. Chef Tetsuya is rank 9th at this time of writing in Asia so definitely a must try.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for its chilli & pepper crab,negative,30,04/28/18,"We came here for supper at 11pm to try their famous chilli crab and black pepper crab. If flavour in both sauce are quite distinct:Black pepper crab- very strong pepper taste, so much so it is quick spicy with a very peppery after taste. And quite salty. It’s a dry “sauce”. Chilli crab- half the pot is the sauce/gravy. It a sweet/spicy chilli sauce.If you love the taste of the “sweetness” of crabs on its own. Unfortunately for you, the sauces are very overpowering and kills the taste of the crab. But if you do not like crabs, you will actually enjoy them for a change because the sauce kills the taste of the crab.This is the only place in Singapore that I have tried the chilli crabs so I have nothing to compare. But having love to eat crabs, it is not to my liking. Apparently the place can get quite busy during peak hours (aka dinner). We came at 11pm, so it was a lot quieter and hence our dishes came out within 10mins. Usually it would take 30mins when it is really busy. Our waitress (the Phillipino lady) who took our order was wonderful and friendly. "

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good veg restaurant ,negative,30,6-Jul-15,Its a good veg restaurant. Been there many times. Their sweets are must to have. I always go there during ganesh puja time. As they make the mawa sweets. Tasty. Service is good but sometime it gets very crowded and need to wait for very long. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Dinner,positive,50,10/20/17,"Last night , 8 of us celebrated our good friend birthday at Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin. We really had an enjoyable night and delicious dinner . We were greeted by friendly staffs namely Bowei, Vivian, Nobel. and others! I must say Terry is very professional , friendly and entertaining . After we told him what kind of dishes we prefer and he recommended Marble Gorby , BBQ Meat Trio, Wasabi prawns, Wagyu beef, Fish maw, Dong Po Pork , Egg plants. We love all the dishes.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible dining experience,negative,20,12-Apr-16,"Asked for physical menu but never get it throughout my dinner (approx. 1.5hr). Not much variety to choose and food served extremely slow that we forgot what we've ordered. Taste wise, so-so. Some are too salty, some are too blend. Horrible. Would not recommend this place to others."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese I have had outside of Australia,positive,50,20-Feb-17,"Found this place on the net, they have an all you can eat buffet so went on a Saturday night only to find it was booked out, our mistake so we booked for the next night. looking forward to it all day as last day in Singapore and certainly not disappointed, seated you have an ipad with menu on it and start selecting dishes and they arrive very timely some slower than others as they are made to order, from the first plate that turned up WOW, I've had plenty of Japanese here at home but this was just different and so much better in a way I cant describe as I'mnot a food critic, only had to stop as had to catch taxi to airport, if I had to find a fault the woman on reception was rather brash but didn't spoil our experience, definitely on my must things to do next time in Singapore which wont be long."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a trip,positive,40,15-Jan-16,Easily found close to the MRT line. Cheap with a wide variety of food.. High turn over with fresh quality food.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worth-trying restaurant!,positive,40,23-Sep-13,"An expensive but worth-trying retaurant!!! It is a little small room with only 8 seats but charming decorations, superlative and extremely fresh food – mouthwatering rice and ugami. It is more interesting to see your food handcrafted with the chef ‘s care, enthusiasm and skill! Its staff is also very attentive. Despite its expensiveness, it is one of the “1 in lifetime” experiences you should try!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place for Sashimi lovers!,negative,30,28-Jul-18,"We went for the lunch buffet. There was a lot of fresh and delicious Sashimi. Very worth it if you are a Sashimi lover. There are other Japanese food (the usual sushi and handrolls) for those who don't eat Sashimi. When the lunch crowd came, service became quite slow. Our last 2 dishes took about 20min to come."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Overall an interesting experience,positive,40,15-Jul-18,"Service was excellent with explanation as to what we were eating. The executive chef checked if the three guys at our table were full near the end of the meal and recommended beef rice which was more filling than the alternative pasta with tomato and soba. There were two birthday guests and the strawberry shortcake to celebrate our birthdays was light and not too sweet. The reason I picked very good and not excellent is because unlike a 2 star in Tokyo where every dish surprised me and was exquisite, here it was a mix of exquisite/really good and OK, so so. The mackerel tataki was OK as were the wagyu and cold soba. However, the cold pasta with tomato and basil was really refreshing, the Bouillabaisse (stew with scallop, lobster, crab etc) was delicious and went very well with the very light bread that accompanied it, and the soft poached egg with truffle and caviar was a lovely mix of texture and taste. The signature dish, the shrimp with sea urchin and caviar was a good mix in terms of sweetness (from the shrimp) and saltiness (from the caviar)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Centre,negative,30,3-Jul-12,"Plenty of local food to choose and try. Famous for grilled seafood , some even halal."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cooked salmon was not fresh,negative,20,21-May-17,"We went there on a fri night, restaurant was busy and they were probably under staffed. Variety and sashimi was ok. I also had the cooked salmon with egg gravy, which my friend tried a little- she did mention it tasted not fresh but I ate it all. 30mins after we left, I vomited out all the cooked salmon and eggs. Imo, the raw stuff are ok.. but the meat they use for their cooked food varieties might not be that fresh (they might feel they are cooking it anyway to kill the bateria) Bad first experience and wil not go back."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic chaats and snacks,positive,40,7-Dec-17,"This branch of Kailash Parbat just opposite to the famous Mustafa Centre seems perennially crowded. It's also cramped , with tables in close proximity. If you brave these inconveniences...there's no further disappointment. In the group we tried Alu tikki chaat, dahi poori, veg noodles and the eternal favourite chole bhature. All the items were tasty, authentic and the rushing waiters attentive and quick. The chaas to wash down the spices and oil was comforting too. The tab was reasonable. A big tick for me...any time...and there is so much more to try too!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",you can always find better!,negative,20,23-Jan-12,This place is definitely over-rated. Food quality is not fantastic and price is definitely a no-no!
French,Saveur,Petite portions,negative,30,16-Jan-15,Not bad a place if you are after petite portions at the prices offered at a no frills place for a variety of gourmet food. Service is quick and polite. You can see the action in the open kitchen. Water is served at 30 cents. The 4 minced pork ravioli portion is yummy. Crab risotto was bland. Not a place to hang around after your meal if you want to have a quiet cosy chat. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average Experience,negative,30,26-Feb-17,Basic sashimi selection. Grilled selection was ok nothing to crow about. We also ordered soup which was a nice change from the usual miso.
French,Paul,"Poor service, and so so food",negative,20,14-Feb-16,"I wonder what is the fuss about this place with the long queue? Decent place, but so so quality food and quite non existence services, left this place much to desire. Will not return."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak frites with a nice ambience,negative,30,29-Apr-12,"The problem is, Les Bouchon is never consistent with its food EXCEPT for its fries... The fries were heavenly but the steaks were not always as good. Sometimes you are lucky and the steak is well done according to your request and most times, it's too rare to be medium or too well to be medium... The consistency for the steaks is just not there yet the highlights are the steaks....Too bad I love the fries a wee too much so thus restaurant is always in my mind... Probably the most expensive hand cut delicious fries in Singapore...Ooh, and the plus is that my favorite fries is free flow!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very Good,positive,40,9-Aug-16,Overall food quality is there but seems a lot decreased from buffet menu. Need to improve on the listing and variety
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",First and Best! ,positive,50,15-Jul-17,For someone who enjoys pure vegetarian food this is the place! Bit expensive conpared to other Indian restaurant in Singapore but the food quality is awesome. Anyone who wants a pure vegetarian dinner can't afford to miss this place.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good option for an Indian meal,positive,40,25-Mar-16,We frequent Muthus Curry at Dempsey Hill often for Indian food. Their chicken biryani is quiet good and so is their vegetarian dishes. The black daal and the paalak daal both are fabulous. Only wish their portions were a wee bit larger.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Amust go for Chats,positive,40,27-Oct-15,this is the place for Chats and other north Indian delicacies. we had visited the place multiple times and the experience is good. its towards the expensive side.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with locals,positive,50,23-May-13,"This place is buzzing, plenty of choices and cooked fresh, we were told to get price of food before buying to make sure not to pay too much. But we had no problems"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Pricey, but fabulous !",positive,50,19-May-15,"The Hawker Centres are an absolute must for eating out in Singapore, and Newton is our favourite. Located right next to the MRT. Don't expect a cheap meal, but do expect a memorable time with very good fresh food. Take a stroll around the various stalls to check what is on offer, place your order, and then find a seat. You will likely be sharing a table with complete strangers, but that is half the fun. The place gets busy every night, and with good reason. On this latest visit, we opted for Tiger Prawns, with fried rice, and steamed vegetables. The prawns were the size of English kippers (!!) seriously, so we restricted ourselves to 2 each. The stallholder will give you a price for these items before you order so you won't get a nasty surprise at the end of the meal. The prawns weighed in at 200-250 grams each, and cost S$16 each, (about £8 each). Not cheap but a terrific meal in a great location with an amazing ambience. Thoroughly recommended ! "
French,Angelina_MBS,Brunch so good,positive,40,22-Apr-16,"We were looking for a good place for brunch and I saw Angelina appear on one of the food bloggers' recommended places. We didn't even know there's Angelina in Singapore!:) So we decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed. First of all, j'adore les croissants and pretty much any kind of bread, to be honest, so I totally dug the basket of fresh breads that came with our brunch. The omelette was soft and creamy, a perfect complement to the smoked salmon I ordered with it. And last but definitely not least, the thick and creamy hot chocolate is exactly what yummy dreams are made of. Perfect it certainly was! We will be back for sure!"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Most delicious Dosa, Worse service Ever!",negative,20,25-Jan-15,"Meal taken away before I was half finished. On a 2nd visit, 3 groups that came in after my friend and I were seated before us."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid! Avoid!,negative,10,20-Jul-13,Everyone will tell you that this is a FAMOUS place to eat local food in Singapore. I've lived here 13 years and the place always gives me the creeps and makes me feel cheated by the aggressive hawkers selling their expensive seafood. The only time I ever go there is if I'm stuck in the neighborhood at lunch time and have no other option. If anyone were to invite me to a group party there in the future...I'd pass.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and Atmosphere,positive,50,14-Oct-18,Good quality of foodGood ambience for friends catching up over dinner. Food is served with reasonable portions. Serving time is not a long wait.

French,Paul,The Food is the Saving Grace ,negative,20,30-Jul-17,"Located on the 3rd floor of the building, this world-famous bakery/cafe is easily accessible. Indoor and outdoor seats are available.The 3-course set dinner is value for money and the portion sizes are adequate, so kudos to the chef and kitchen team. On the service side, things could greatly be improved.Firstly, the wait staff could be friendlier and offer a smile when showing us to the table. Secondly, the set dinner soup was pumpkin but I overhead later that it was finished and replaced with tomato. No one thought to inform us of the change. Thirdly, the wait for the main course was almost half an hour. We had to signal the staff to bring out the mains. They could have taken notice and apologised for the wait, both of which was expected but none of which was done.Luckily, the food was the saving grace, but we will think twice before dining here again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best sushi!,positive,50,29-Aug-18,"I went there for my birthday treat with my hubby.Please make reservation and get the counter seats!The chef will prepare every single sushi and serve directly to you piece by piece. He will only make the second piece once you ate the first piece.All very fresh ingredients, melt in the mouth.. you can opt for less rice too.They add surprise element by serving the birthday cake / dessert by turning off the light, singing the song, the chefs all wear masks (Japanese characters.one of them was Pikachu). Birthday hat and balloon... so cool!!Great place to celebrate special occasion and you can arrange surprise too!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",A decent branch of the Little India staple,positive,40,1-Jun-16,"I was a bit apprehensive about trying this place. We had been regulars at their Little India outlet but have stopped going there for a while as (a) its quality had dropped, and (b) there are better alternatives nearby. The Dempsey outlet looks a lot...More"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Dodgy Seafood hawkers,negative,30,13-Jul-13,Seafood very fresh but be careful that you get what you pay for. Some hawkers will try to sell you over priced seafood so make sure they weigh it in front of your eyes as you pay per 100 gramms.
French,Saveur,Nice Restaurant,positive,50,17-Aug-16,Had a lunch here last Sunday. Nice food and ambient. The price is affordable for French cuisine. Enjoy my lunch here.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Gathering with Friends,positive,40,06/16/16,"Had dinner with my friends at London Fat Duck, located at Scotts Square basement tonight. Nearest MRT will be Orchard station.It's the few restaurants that still serves dim sum all day. Nice roast duck, roast pork and smooth porridge. Restaurant has about 40-50 seating, with 2 big tables good for 8 persons each. Polite waiters and waitresses served promptly.Enjoyed. Tasty food at above average prices."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Set expectation before going: novel open kitchen dining concept, not so good for intimate dining",positive,40,10-Jul-12,"It was a dinner for a real special occasion. For a dinner that is more than S$500 per person without wine, I had expected the dining experience to have sent my spouse and I to the stars and back. The food is undoubtedly imaginatively executed and tasted fabulous at every dish. 5 stars for food quality. We were not sure we got value for our buck though. That is very subjective matter especially if trying to compare amongst restaurants in this end of the spectrum. As for the atmosphere, we did not enjoy sitting on a high chair (uncomfortable for thighs and lower back) at a open teppanyaki table with 2 other couples throughout dinner , and the conversations are audible to everyone else at the table. Maybe we are more conservative. Maybe it was also how sound travels around a small room and across a stainless steel surface. If you are planning on having a dinner where you can also enjoy your private couple space for intimate conversations then this dining concept may not be for you. It is a matter have having the correct expectations. Overall, it was a great meal and memorable creativity, however I do not think I will come back again for a while until the dining concept is tweaked."

We were pleasantly surprise when Terry took the initiative to offer us brand new stemware when we just wanted a glass will do. Service was prompt and delivery of food was just right with our flight of wines. Although the restaurant was pretty packed that night, Sook Teng managed to handle our request well and always with a genuine smileI am here again tonight with another group of friends for a casual dinner and that high level of service with tasty fresh cuisine consistently delivered by Bowie.Well done and keep up the good work and smile!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but needs little improvement,positive,40,6-Feb-18,"The food is good but some items are too spicy , also the AC is not very effective, Oh yes the seating chairs are fixed to the floor so does not make the entire eating thing comfortable.Their menu is good and preparations are also good , service is fast ."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best Steak Frites and Ambience,positive,50,6-Jun-16,"This is my favorite place for authentic steak frites in Singapore, with a very reasonably priced menu and great al fresco atmosphere flanking the Singapore River along Robertson Quay.

French,Saveur,Will come back again,positive,40,22-Jun-16,"Ordered : foie gras with lentils, salmon confit, baked chicken, salmon, beef, chocolate &hazelnutFoie gras: creamy,melt in your mouth goodness, paired perfectly with lentil to bring down the oilyness. Salmon: 2.5 out of 5 stars. Barley risotto is sour and uncomfortabke, salmon skin is excessively salty. Only good part is the soft,moist pinkish salmonC&H: heaven on first 5 bites.Jalat after. Crunchy bits gives texture to this art piece dessert and the raspberries help to lessen the jalat feel. Pure sinful .yum."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious wasabi prawn & soft shell crab,positive,40,04/25/15,"Ate dinner here with my team. We ordered a couple of dishes which included this fried soft shell crab and wasabi prawn which was really really good. The ambiance was typical fine dining Chinese resto, service was ok, but what won me over were those two dishes. Would come back to order them if ever I am in the area. The place is good for both family and business gatherings."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wow is their food ever good!,positive,50,9/2/2014,"As a group of six persons we enjoyed their chill crab and pepper crab tremendously. Finger licking good. Also their puddings and jellies for desert, especially the durian one, delicious. Friendly and helpful service personnel, especially when it comes to help us cracking the crabs open. The atmosphere is laid back but attentive service staff who doesn’t mind going the extra mile. Definitely a place to go back to and enjoy more sea food."

Mind-blowing!",positive,50,7-Sep-15,"Made a lunch reservation for 2 through email and the restaurant replied very quickly, hassle free! Upon arrival, we were greeted politely and made to sit at the beautiful sushi bar. The restaurant was very quiet and ambience was fantastic. Ordered the 15-piece lunch set and was not disappointed at all! EVERYTHING-from the appetisers, to the nigiri sushi, to the desserts at the end...everything was perfect, flawless. Highlights of the meal were definitely the Uni, Chutoro and Otoro! The grilled tiger prawn is worth a mention too! This meal is just too good! Friendly chefs and brilliant service. Definitely will be back in no time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Used to be a great place, but alas, no longer",negative,20,24-Jan-12,"Pushy stall owners, only ok food, and ridiculous prices! Not a place I'd be recommending. Waited more than 25 minutes for our food, then went back to the stall to realise they had lost the order. And when the food arrived, it wasn't anything to write home about."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Yummy, cheap and fun",positive,40,26-May-16,"Great hawker market for a cheap meal in Singapore. Lots of stalls around the edges with tables in the middle the only problem is deciding what to try! We had a delicious satay and fried carrot cake with two very cold large beers. Top food, great experience wish I could have dinner here every night!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Okay tasting local food, but all located in one hawker centre",negative,30,27-Feb-15,"I visited Newton Hawker Center on 26th Feb and at 730pm, the car park was almost full and the parking attendant was making his rounds and issuing parking fines! Do note, they do not have a gantry system, so have your parking coupons ready!There are a lot of BBQ Seafood stalls in Newton and most of them sell the same stuff. Do note that though they tout and push each shop, every customer has the right to say NO! The touters get commission based on what they sell to you. To avoid getting cheated, pay upon ordering and INSIST so, else you might end up with a 3 digit bill at the end of your meal, with no explanation.Here's a review of the food we shared amongst 6 people.The Ocean BBQ #01-016 We just picked the stall we sat right next too, but I did notice that the stalls facing the inner circle seemed to be more popular. This ocean BBQ, is one of the outside stalls facing the car park.1. Lemon Chicken $15I loved lemon chicken and we ordered this. Expecting to be a thick chicken cutlet, I was surprised to see it served as fried cubed chicken. Some pieces were of the thigh meat, hence more flavourful, some pieces were breast meat and very dry. The sauce itself was decent, very lemony and you can taste the slight blend of honey. But I guess having cubed-sized chicken makes it easier for sharing.2. Sambal Singray $15My friend mentioned that the sambal was nice and it was! It was slightly sweet and for someone like me who doesn't eat spicy. This was the perfect sambal stingray for me! The stingray was meaty and the meat was easily separated from the bones. 3. Sambal SotongA similar sauce from the stingray was stir fried with the sotong, hence making the sotong abit sweet. The sotong tasted fresh and the serving was big enough for the 6 of us to share. Chances is, I might hit this stall up again, the next time I'm here. Definitely in love with their sambal!Bedok 85 Fried Oyster #01-0401. Oyster Omelette $5They were very generous with the oysters, The egg was crispy on the top layer, but on the bottom layer, it was soggy and was very mushy. I didn't quite like it in the end. If you want really good oyster omelette, try Kim Keat at Bradell.2. Carrot Cake White/black $4Even though their sign boards still says the carrot cakes are sold in $3 portions, They have increased their prices. The black had alot more egg and was sweet. The white wasn't crispy and tasted bland. Overall, another upsetting local dishKwang Huat #01-015 My friend was patiently waiting for this stall to open at 745pm! And at 730pm the owners were ready to take orders, but we didn't get our food till about 750pm.1. Hokkien Prawn Mee $5For $5, you get a satisfying plate of prawn mee with a lot of gravy, and 4 big prawns. The gravy is truly tasty and yummy. Although you can tell they did not use any lard, so it's missing that special taste. Some sotong and egg is what you get with the prawn mee, no three-layer pork meat either. I guess this stall is now muslim-friendly. 2. Char Kway Teow This was a rather OK dish at best. I couldn't taste the wok-hei and there were a lot of cockles and no other ingredients, there were like 2 slices of 50 cent coin sized fish cakes.. I do not like cockles, so I found this very upsetting. Char Kway teow to me is my most favourite dish in Singapore but I wouldn't come back here for this.Singa Cafe #01-014 Their sugar juice drinks are $1.50 and can drinks are priced at $1.50. Very reasonable pricingSoursop Juice $2I loved that their soursop juice was full of soursup meat. The drink was served with a plastic spoon, which you will need to scoop up the fruit.For those unknown to the benefits of soursop.Soursop contains a number of natural substances that have biological benefits such as, relieve stomach distress, fever, pain and respiratory problems such as cough and asthma.TKR #01-030 After walking around, we realized the prices were standard for the chicken wings $1.30 and 60cents per satay. We decided to go with TKR as it was a chinese stall, which meant they sold pork satay!1. Pork/chicken/mutton Satay 60 cents eachWe ordered 10 sticks of pork, 10 sticks of chicken and 10 sticks of mutton which added up to $18, and they gave us 5 bowls of satay sauce. The pork satay had alot of fats in them, which for me, I actually enjoyed. For the health conscious, you might want to just take the chicken sticks, which were more tender. The mutton was considerably drier than the chicken and pork, but it didn't have the weird smell. So I was okay with it.2. BBQ Chicken wings $1.30 eachThe chicken wings were pretty good. I enjoyed the crispy roasted skin. The meat was very juicy and I felt that for BBQ chicken wings, these weren't too oily and is a good choice for me! I've had BBQ chicken wings dripping with oil and that's usually the reason why I avoid them.They were presented very nicely on the styrofoam plate. They definitely gave some thought into present"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bad food ,negative,20,25-Dec-16,"The interior of this place is really nice. Unfortunately, the food was really bad. The manchow soup tasted more like Manchuria gravy, far too spicy and garlicky. The jhalfrezi was sweet, the daal makhani too watery. The only thing that tasted good was daal tadka. The quality of the food has been consistent, it was just as unsavory the last time I dined here. "
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore","Decent visit for a family,Nice decor and location in quay",positive,40,6-Oct-18,My professor hosted annual getogether at the restaurant.Decor is a balance of colours by a blend of dark shades with comfortable hues of light colours.Buffet option was a delight with both veg and non veg options.The dessert options can be improved though.Just gulab jamun and...More
French,Saveur,Average service,negative,30,31-Mar-16,"Service was very average. My plate was not cleared after we were done with the meal. For a good 20min. Staff were walking right past us and never once asked to take our plates away. Had to ask for them to clear it and bring out the dessert. The salted caramel lava cake is honestly one of the worst desserts I've ever had... The ""cake"" had a rubbery texture and the entire filling was salted caramel so the sweetness was just overwhelming. The duck confit was the only saving grace and that's the only reason why I'd ever consider going back...Disappointing experience. Been here twice before and this was the worst experience. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet worth it!,positive,40,11-Nov-17,"Worth the money, selection interesting but just go for sashimi!
Orders can be delayed and missed. Otherwise worth a visit."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood, well priced",positive,40,3/1/2017,Went here with a large group (20) and the venue and service were perfect for the occasion. One of our local Singaporean friends ordered a banquet and the food was all really tasty. Chilli crab was pretty good but lacking on the chilli front. Beer was Ice cold.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food with a terrific ambiance.,positive,50,08/17/14,We had chili crabs and pepper crabs at a business dinner. The crab was great. Very good prawn chow fun as well. If the weather is good be sure to sit outside. I like this place.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",his signature dish really is amazing,positive,40,20-Apr-16,"With the Michelin guide coming to Singapore, I figured we should try this restaurant while we could still get tables. I had trouble with paying this much food for essentially minimally cooked ingredients. After receiving my Visa statement, I still don't think this was worth it but I am glad I tried it. The restaurant is beautiful. You are seated at individual stations with maximum 8 guests. I found it strange that they were so insistent on us arriving on time as the whole room eats together and yet a couple arrived about 45 minutes into our meal and had an abbreviated version of our dinner. It was off-putting simply because they were SO annoying about the time issue beforehand. The food was good but because it is seasonal, you have no say in what you eat. Therefore instead of the salt smoked Alaskan king crab (which I can also get at home but is still a treat), we were served Atlantic lobster, which I grew up eating fresh out of the sea every summer. Needless to say, no matter how fresh it was before it got on the plane, it's not going to taste as good as in Canada. The signature dish was very tasty. Unlike my expectations, there is some sort of marinade (the chef confirmed it) to the shrimp so it is not just a pile of raw ingredients as some critics have suggested. Dessert is served in a lounge with a view and was very nice French style chocolates and cakes. Was it worth $1700 for 2 people? I don't think so, but I'm glad I tried it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One menu item is all you need!,positive,50,19-Sep-18,"Went here for a casual business lunch... what a great place.As far as I can tell, apart from the appetisers there is only one menu item which is steak and frites... and that’s just fine with me.Cute little place, reasonably priced with really great food."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fantastic dim sum, great service",positive,40,10/30/16,"I decided to bring my family to the dim sum buffet in Peach Blossoms, since it has been a number of years I last patronised the restaurant. The decor remains the same, and the service remains great. The dim sum buffet was quite different from the one three or four years ago. For one, they have a trolley that carries several popular dim sum dishes from which you can choose from. Secondly, they offer a select range of choice appetizers you can choose from (one choice per diner). So you get to try abalone, lobster, sharks' fin dishes in the buffet.Choices are abundant in this a la carte buffet. You can choose main courses, porridge, noodles, rice, djm sum, soup and even desserts. Since it's a buffet, you can order dishes any number of times. Portions are not small, nor are they huge. The food is also not too oiley. I didn't get the bloated feel after the meal.The buffet is available between 11:30 and 3 pm. It's a good deal, for a person at $58++. Children below 6 years old are free. Great to try if you will like to!"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",A good fast food joint,positive,40,22-Jul-13,This place is a bit expensive as compared to similar category places like Komala Bhawan but the place inside feels much bigger with a better ambience and food taste/quality. A lot of options make you come back to this place again and again.

French,Paul,Poor Service at Westgate branch,negative,10,13-Dec-15,"Yesterday I experienced the same poor service experienced shared by this post in tripadvisor, https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2518800-r192965790-Paul-Singapore.htmlI wonder if it is the same waitress. Her attitude was the worst. First, no one attended to us when we first entered the restaurant. Then one of the staff indicated a seat. We sat down and this waitress told us the seat had occupants that went to the rest room. We moved to another empty seat and she told us we couldn't seat there because it was a seat for 4. These were obviously two circular tables of 2 placed together to make a 4 seater. The restaurant wasn't even crowded but she insisted for us to move. I left the restaurant and I'm never going back again."
French,Angelina_MBS,Food and Dessert,negative,30,30-Dec-16,Came here for 1 for 1 with the entertainer app. Mains were good and hearty. Seafood risotto had a bitter aftertaste. Beef stew and sea bass (no snapper that day) was well cooked. Signature mont-blanc was normal and tasted similar to red bean paste. Opera cake was nicer in my opinion because I'm a chocolate lover. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Save some cash and sample new tastes,positive,40,26-Aug-13,"Experience a little atmosphere in a tourist-safe area. Try some dishes without breaking the bank. Hawkers from individual stands will try to convince you to eat in their booth, but be patient and walk around until you see something that interests you. Hawkers are assertive but not aggressive. Be sure to establish the price as you order, not afterward. Dont rely on the posted price."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Dim sum buffet ,positive,50,01/13/16,"I saw the recommendation for the Dim sum buffet through this website and have tried it.I came with my friends to celebrate a birthday bash. We were served with a plate of birthday wishes in the form of chinese poem. The food quality is good and value for money.Their sevice staff is very friendly and attentive to us. The birthday wishes are also well written. I understand the poem was by their service staff, Terry. This venue is worth a second visit."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced tourist trap,negative,20,19-Feb-13,"Newton Hawker centre is an overpriced tourist trap, particularly the stalls selling seafood. You can get food of the same or better quality at lower prices at any of the hawker centers in Singapore. The stalls on the edge, away from where the tourists normally go are much better value. If you want the atmosphere, and the seafood than Long Beach at Dempsey is better (although it is also a bit of a tourist trap) whereas if you want the Hawker experience than Lau Pa Sat has a wider variety at proper prices"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic and excellent place!,positive,50,22-Aug-17,"Came on a busy Sunday afternoon for the lunchtime buffet using the Entertainer app (1-for-1 promotion). We ordered the sashimi platter several times and it was amazing. Highly recommend the sashimi (Tuna and Salmon) as it is very fresh. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. However, with that being said, I think the place can also improve further. For example, my partner and I were seated at a table which was very squeezy. We were placed next to the utensils drawers. It ruined the ambience for me, as I was constantly listening to the staff pulling and closing the drawers (it was very loud as well). The restaurant uses the ""tablet menu"", and for my partner and I, the table was already small enough (2 platters and the table would be too full for even a cup of water), there was no space (no drawer, compartment below table) for the tablet so we had to lean it against the wall standing up. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Reliable,positive,40,13-Aug-16,"We prefer this branch over the little India branch. Clean, fast and efficient. Service is good and the food is always reliable. Wish they brought back the crab meat starter which is no longer on menu."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent Sunday Dimsum,positive,40,08/15/14,Get there early and great for a Sunday lunch. It is queue and wait and well worth the effort. Reasonably priced for good dim sum and sufficient through put of people not to be stale.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family lunch ,positive,40,4/8/2017,I craved Singapore based pepper crab and went here straight from the airport. While the staff were attentive the place definitely had a worn down vibe and a bit touristy without the benefits...a bit pricey and the food was ultimately serviceable but nothing grand to write home about. Go if you are hungry and in the neighborhood but don't make the effort to go if out of the way.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Awesome food,positive,50,10-Jun-13,Brilliant place to eat for vegetarians... Had north Indian mean - was a delight. Would recommend it to any vegetarian Indian travelling to Singapore. Very reasonable at cSGD10 per person for a meal.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Duxton Hill French Bistro,positive,40,9-Aug-12,"We enjoyed a recent trip to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill after a recommendation by a friend who had just returned from Singapore. Cute little renovated bistro very reminiscent of Fance Soir in Melbourne and thousands of actual bistros in France. We all decided on the signature salad, steak and fries. Green salad came first and was followed by a plate two thirds covered with French Fries. The steak was perfectly cooked to order and came already sliced into strips with the very tasty rich sauce. Tables quite close together in the French style so could not help but hear and notice Irish fellow next to us making a ""chip butty"" with his fries and bread roll. Wine list was quite good with many price points. We shared two desserts of chocolate fondant cake and tarte tatin. Both great tasting, but the tarte was a base of thick cake, not pastry, but perhaps this is a method that lasts longer in the heat and humidity of Singapore. All in all a fun night."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic sushi,positive,50,14-May-14,"We got a recommendation to have some sushi while in Singapore, we found this small place simple sushi bar in Hotel Raffle in Beach road. You enter to a small sushi counter, maybe 20 seats. Youa re severed by the chef directly. One of the best restaurants ever, simple, fantastically fresh, quality outstanding. Very simple to order, they just asked if we didn't eat something, then just served what they had and was good for the day, didn't need a menu.I will go back any day. Price is quite expensive, but for the quality fair. Reservation recommended"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at Shin Minori,positive,40,14-Sep-16,"It was a pretty good dining experience. The service was fine considering that it was quite crowded. Ordering the food was very easy. The food was good and varied. Atmosphere was cosy. Overall, my family enjoyed the dinner and would recommend this place to others who like Japanese food. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is good but service is unpredictable,negative,30,09/22/12,"I've been patronising here since its inception when our favorite Jumbo Restaurant left Serangoon Gardens Country Club. The ambience is grand wt high ceilings & spacious. Very good for inviting guests & family gatherings. Food is good but slightly on the pricey side. Dim Sums are good and lots of variety to choose from either order through waiters or pick from the push-carts. Seafood is presentable and nice but the crabs may not be always packed and meaty unlike No Signboard Restaurant which never fails to serve good quality meaty packed crabs. Service can be unpredictable & depends on your luck. Our first few visits were unfortunate to have this one female supervisor, Mag, who was blatantly rude, unprofessional & ill-treating us & other neighboring tables too. I feedbacked to Simon, the manager, but he coudln't do much to improve. At times, we had an excellent supervisor named John but sadly he has left after our 6th visit. Simon is stll there and he still behaves with an indifferent attitude, one ear in one ear out. Occasionally, the waiting time for our dishes was late and delayed despite several reminders. I reckon Simon needs to improve his attitude to serve diners with a heart and not just as a manager title. I find the elderly aunties who serve dishes are nicer, more pleasant, courteous and friendlier than the supervisors or Simon. With UOB cards there's discount.I normally hold celebrations like birthdays, Mothers Day, reunions, gatherings in this place due to its proximity to my house. Oyes, parking is ample and can be valet too. Sad to say, the standards have dropped through the years. Also because the management are not willing to listen to genuine feedbacks from their loyal & faithful supporters. Seems to play hard to reach giving the impression of aloofness & cold."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chats are disappointing!,negative,30,10-May-12,Kailash parbat being an Indian chain is popular for its Chaats. Our first visit to KP (last year) made sure we are a regular visitor to this place but after that all visits have been highly disappointing.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy Sri Lankan black pepper Crab,positive,50,8/1/2016,The best and biggest Sri Lankan pepper crab ever. 2kg for 2 person to share. Steamed razor clam from Scotland. Stir fried Baby kai lan with crispy salted fish and their signature crispy tofu. Full with Great satisfaction!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's a must!,positive,50,7-Sep-13,"Yes I know the locals will say its not authentic enough and way too pricey! But it must do something right when it's been here for decades and still one gets an excellent meal for good prices. My recent visit happened on a Friday night, filled with families and friends all feasting on crabs, lobsters, shells and the typical local fair. Each stall will bring the food to you, which is what I love about street food here, one doesn't need to navigate the crowds to find a seat and then try to not spill your food. We had giant grilled prawns, a round of satay and vegetables. Tasted great and the along with the atmosphere a must for not only those living here but the tourist as well. For the tourists have no fear, it's clean, all B ratings, friendly and has bathroom amenities too."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Great vegetarian choices but taste is average,negative,30,31-Jul-15,It has brances in various locations and the taste also varies between locations. The best location to have good food is at the Changi Airport T2 or Syeed Alwi Road. Some dishes are good and some dishes are just average. South Indian Meals is just...More
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced,positive,40,7/5/2014,"I went to Yum Cha with friends while visiting Singapore at the end of June. The dim sum was good but I have had better, and overpriced for what it was. It was nice to see the place filled with locals, and our service was good. This place seems to be highly recommended to tourists but I believe there is better dim sum to be had in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,expensive but doesn't have to be,positive,40,29-Jan-12,"When you step into L'Angelus, you certainly step into a little bit of France. This is an expensive restaurant but a great little one. Mains are around $40-50 and the starters around $20. I've lived and cheffed in France and the snails were the best I've come across especially when you put their greasy bread topping to one side. We each had the steak tartare, mixed by the front of house staff behind us and accompanied by fries. I have to say though, I love my food but this was too big a portion and just the right size for two to share. The same can be said for the creme brulee. When we go back I think we'll go all lady and the trampy and share each course. I think L'Angelus would be better served by cutting the portion sizes which would let them cut the prices. Until then... just share your meals! We had superb service despite the restaurant being full."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Definitely Not Value For Money!!,negative,10,11-Jul-16,"Only the food photos on website looks good, but it is not. One of the worst Japanese ala carte buffet restaurant we (4 adults) have experienced. Website said ""authentic"" Japanese food, which I have my doubts! Our first and last visit. The price does not include the basic drinks i.e. water and/or green tea. Service is bad too. Chefs and waitresses speaks only Chinese, not that I have problem with Chinese, but this is just to highlight to visitors who are non Chinese speaking."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly service,positive,40,23-Sep-17,Food was okay. Not fantastic but the food arrived really quickly despite the restaurant being quite busy. Staff were quick to clear empty plates.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun,positive,40,28-Jul-17,Love this hawker centre!! I live near Orchard road and it's the closest. Good food and beer! Prices are very reasonable!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Awesome Dim Sum Buffet, great value, nice ambience n great attentive staff",positive,40,06/22/18,"Not my first visit to Yum Cha Restaurant, happy that food and service still good. The aunties were very nice and attentive to my kids, ensuring food are served fast so that wont get hungry. Nice variety of dim sums, love most of the items. We enjoyed it. Would be nice if they can have family buffet rates/sets. Think kids do not eat too much so buffet price is slightly high, but overall experience, good!"

The resturant set up like a food court. All the food are very tasty and in the right location."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab,negative,30,2/4/2014,"I was told pepper crab originated here. It wasn't as good as the other place in terms of taste. The crab we had wasn't fresh.
Other dishes were alright but the food in general was overpriced!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Excellent Seafood, lively resturant",positive,40,08/23/15,"We ate twice here during June and August. The fresh coconut juice, salt and pepper prawns, lobster, black pepper crab and chilli crab are all exellent. The atmosphere in the clearly very popular and busy restaurant is very lively. We all thouroughly enjoyed the food. Service seems rather brusque, but the restauant was extremely busy on both occasions. One one occasion we were billed for peanuts we did not have whichwa quickly corrected although with no apology and why in this quite expensive establishment do they charge for hand wipes, essential if you are eating the crab."
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and pastries,positive,50,28-Mar-17,This is my favourite new cafe to have a long black and palmier. Love the palmier and it's the best I've tasted by far. The set meal is reasonably priced and quality of food is good.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Priced for tourists - be aware,negative,30,4-Jun-15,Food quality is good but most of the seafood stalls (for which Newton is known for) charge exorbitant prices because the centre is popular with tourists. It is near Orchard and regularly on the tourist 'must do' list.If you really want good seafood try the East coast seafood centre which has a better ambience and probably similar prices.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",MUCH ABOUT NOT TOO MUCH !,negative,30,21-Jul-17,"I chose to dine at Shin Minori after reading an online review.The ambience was average and the seating cramp.Staff were well mannered but not too helpful. The supervisor (maybe captain or manager) made sure we knew her status because when I asked her for assistance, she would delegate a waiter or waitress to respond to me instead.The first 3 plates of sashimi were fresh but after that it was soft and warm.Other dishes were mostly served singular and in extremely small portions. It was frustrating to see the food served in this manner. They were like children's masak masak dishes! However, must say the salad was impressive... crisp and tasty dressing!My daughter had a cake after dinner and said it was small in portion and tasted below average.After our visit, my family members said it wasn't value for money and they'd prefer to eat elsewhere.    "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food and atmosphere,positive,50,14-Sep-16,"Friendly stall holders, wonderful food! Prices are very good, service is excellent. Drinks are at reasonable prices. Table service is fast and efficient. If they don't have what you want, they will find a stall that does!! Best hawker we have been to"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Japanese buffet place but lacks punch on the taste,negative,30,3-Jan-17,Was there for lunch to celebrate my gf birthday. Menu variety was ok and ordered food comes quite promptly. But my hamachi sashimi cut was way to thick hehe...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mother's Day Dinner,positive,50,17-May-17,Service was polite and efficient. Food was good. The dining party enjoyed all the dishes ordered and we have decided to make this restaurant our go-to Japanese Ala carte buffet resto. Says a lot since we live in the Northeast and our weekly Japanese go-to wAs in the East.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lively, noisy, fun - and terrific food",positive,50,19-Feb-12,"Singapore's hawker centres are one of the city's joys; great food at very cheap prices. Newton is well-established, with plenty of choice: chilli Crab, black pepper crab (even better than chilli crab!) and Tiger prawns. The place may look chaotic but it's not: grab a table (and remember its number), then cruise past the various stalls and choose your dinner; it will be delivered to your table swiftly. A really great way to enjoy the local food, with plenty of atmosphere."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Not worthy,negative,20,17-Sep-18,"We ordered masala dosa and tomato rice
Masala dosa taste was just ok
Tomato rice taste was good
They offers 4 types chatni but believe me only white coconut chatni is only good other 3 are just waste and we just taste once then did...More"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Too pretentious for a bistrot,negative,10,10-Feb-15,"Hi everyone,  My friend who is living in Singapore was trying to book a table for my venue with my family but it seems to be a ""tourist trap!"" We asked a booking for 14peoples, they called me to inform that we have to pay minimum charges 150SGD which is around 100USD for a steak and fries???? Couldn't be serious? Even we take many bottles of red wine but seriously for 14 people it is a LOT! I am disappointed of the reaction of the owner. Is that not too greedy to take advantage of tourist in this way? There is a lot of restaurants in Singapore, we found a great one in Duxton Hill ""l'entrecote"" with charming chophouse in the area so we did our booking without any problem!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Authentic, wonderful food - perfunctory service",positive,40,12/26/15,"A really great meal in a nice environment, but the service is strange ... we ordered soup, dim sum, main courses, rice and vegetables and every dish was delivered together, all at once within five minutes ... when we asked if they could keep the food hot so we could eat the soup first, we were not accommodated ... when we finished, no one asked if we wanted dessert or if we wanted a check ... we just sat and sat and sat until the entire restaurant cleared and still no one came to the table ... the staff just proceeded cleaning up and ignored us ... it was a wonderful meal but a bizarre experience ... it was not until we asked that we were told to go to the cashier ... "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best places to eat in Chinatown,positive,50,12/27/16,"I've read some articles about this restaurant, and convinced me to give it a try. It is located among the major streets in Chinatown area. The ambience is not that attractive, however people keep on coming back for its taste. I highly recommend the xiao long bao, and their garlic pork."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go!,negative,10,19-Feb-12,The place is run by a mafia of aggressive hawkers who charge $500 per chilli crab.
French,Poulet,Poultry at Poulet is magnifique,positive,40,6-May-14,"Was my first time to Poulet (T3 outlet) at the invite of my friends. He was raving about the dishes, especially their poultry dish with mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Other than the poultry dish, we also had the french onion soup, the oxtail stew, some fries for appetizer and another friend of my ordered the brisket. The review: true to the recommendation, the poultry was very tender and moist. Apparently it was soaked in brine for a whole day before it was slow roasted. However, it did not go well with the mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Simply put, it was more like Carbonara sauce from a bottle off the supermarket shelves . There is no taste of mushroom or Chardonnay, just heavy cream. The french onion was average. Another dish worth mentioning was the oxtail. My wife had a few atttempts at making oxtail stew at home and the lesson learnt to a good stew is slow cook or pressure-cooking. Poulet did just that and the result is a tender, beefy oxtail stew. Though i did not taste the red wine in the red wine sauce, the oxtail itself was good enough. As for the brisket, forget about it as the meat was dry. Overall, i would recommend Poulet to my friends, though i would ask them to skip the ""Mushroom"" ""Chardonnay"" sauce and go for the poultry itself."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Very friendly and affordable place,positive,50,4-Sep-14,"Very nice and caring people,we went for breakfast and were given very good service, have variety of South Indian chutneys including for Jains, South Indian coffee is a treat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Mixed skills and different quality local food,negative,30,3-Apr-13,It used to be one of the best places to eat at in Singapore and my family often frequent there but much has changed. Not every stall that you go to serve you good local food. You've to be wiser and more selective now. I recall the Thai food stall there is one of the best. 
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",AB,negative,30,26-May-15,Pure Vegetarian food . we can get taste will be moderate. nothing much to say !. Near Mustafa Centre is an advantage
French,Saveur,Disappointed after the hype,negative,20,6-Oct-18,"The duck confit, sea bass and aglio olio were all below average. The only food that stood out was the panna cotta"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Authentic Indian food,positive,40,8-Jan-18,"We have been dining at Kailash Parbhat, opposite Mustafa centre regularly. One thing we have noticed is that quality and taste only gets better every time.Our favorite there are - Lemon coriander soup, panneer tika (starter), Veg chilli milli and ofcourse lip smacking chats. Highly recommend this place for residents and visitors alike, though the price may be bit on the higher side."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE BEST BLACK PEPPER CRAB EVER,positive,40,10/20/17,"Arranged by our hotel,very busy Saturday night,We sat outside and enjoyed the cooler weather.Due to the very busy night service was a bit slow but understandable . We sat on a couple of beers and watched the action.We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and side dishes and were not disappointed when they arrived. A Large crab with the most magnificent pepper flavour I have tasted plenty of meat and rice."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A night at Shin Minori,negative,30,23-Jul-17,"I went with my wife for dinner at 21 July 2017 using the reservation service from Chope. This was our second visit to the restaurant for this year.1. Service was average to slightly above average. The restaurant was busy but staff were responsive. Most of the staff don't look too happy, except for the filipino waitress who was serving our area.2. Food was below average in general. Salmon sashimi was good as usual. Sushi was one of the winners, although I felt that the rice portion could have been reduced by 50%. The swordfish sashimi was not palatable - yes, this was the same as our first visit. Swordfish/Mekajiki is one of my favourite, hence I ordered it again, hoping that it would somehow it would be better this round - sigh! All other dishes were below average.3. Ambience - you almost have to be shouting to have a conversation. So don't expect too much.We had wanted to use our Entertainer app, but only realised that it was for lunch buffet when we arrived. Hence, we paid over $100 for 2 pax for the dinner.For this amount of money, I definitely can find something better. I suggest to go this place only if you are big fan of sushi, salmon sashimi and only if you have a 1 for 1 promotion coupon."
French,Angelina_MBS,Not for me,negative,30,10-Dec-16,"I went there due to the popularity of the dessert.Environment: Nice for tai tai high tea, chit chat and tea for few hours. Service is goodDesserts: Very pretty and nice looking. Taste good but all very sweet to me, it sounds funny if desserts are not sweet but it is way over and all of us cannot even finish it as once you ate more, you feel bloated.Price: Mid range, to me it is quite expensive to pay $10+ for desserts"
French,Angelina_MBS,Morning pastry and coffee,positive,40,14-Jun-15,"Coffee is average but cakes is quite tasty. Felt this place had a classical European touch.Nice environment and relaxed atmosphere. Recommended.. Best thing is that although the restaurant is full on a Sunday morning, you won't find it too congested. Recommended!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Tokyo Standard Japanese Sushi in Singapore,positive,50,13-Jul-17,"It had moved to Carlton hotel some time ago & this was the first time we went there, & we had the OMAKASE for our dinner. It has a seating for 12 at the counter, & three more tables at the side & a private room; obviously u need to make an advance booking if you want to get a counter seat. This is the place to go in S'pore if you demand same high quality Sushi as you would get at those high end Sushi Restaurants in Japan, so be prepared to pay a hefty premium."
French,Angelina_MBS,Affordable French Dining at CBD,positive,50,29-Dec-16,"Strongly recommend their set dinner. Was very impressed by the chestnut blonc cupcake. Portion is just nice, and the overall food taste is delicious."

Great sake too and hot tea on tab. I cant praise the food enough - words will do it no justice so just treat yourself and GO !!!!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good Food,positive,40,13-Feb-16,"We had been here a few times. The good is definitely above average, the service is excellent but I believe due to the Brand name ""Kailash Parbat"", the place is overly hyped.. Recommended to try though. Huzayf"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not as good as expected,negative,30,20-Oct-15,"Heard and read reviews that the steak from this place was one of the best. However, I was a little disappointed as a birthday dinner turned out to be one of the most unforgettable experience. There was a fly or mosquito flying around inside the restaurant and service was bad.The steak is not too bad and the portion is huge but the salad and cold fries were disappointing."

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fat Duck!!!,negative,30,07/30/15,"I am not a fans of Duck meat but London Fat Duck had left a deep impression in my mouth. For health conscious people might not like the fatness of the meat. I Iove the fatness of the meat, soft to chew and the roasted Skin is crisp, goes very well with the plum sauce. Tried their signature Chee Cheong Fun, it's actually the fried prawn spring roll wrap with Chee Cheong Fun, interesting combine and its delicious. Black Pepper duck Snow Bun taste like McDonald's Prosperity burger. Overall feel the food is good but might not want to queue too long for a table. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Things have Changed!,negative,30,14-Dec-16,"Had another dinner there recently. Angelina's appears to be trying to cater to a different market segment now. Red Snapper has been changed to a cheaper fish. No more complementary bread rolls. On the day I went, only 4 types of macarons."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Double Celebration justifies the price...,positive,50,19-Feb-15,"Was there to celebrate wife's birthday with her favourite niece, nephew and spouses. Interesting that the chopsticks were visibly damp - reason is to prevent food from sticking and apparently it's also a Japanese welcome. Food, ambience and service are as described by the other reviews.. price too. We thoroughly enjoyed the recommended sake and champagne! Thoughtful of them to provide a dainty birthday cake but even more thoughtful was an additional Anniversary dessert - they probably took the cue from our noisy Yam Sengs... much appreciated."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing this time....,negative,30,16-May-17,"We have been to this restaurant many times, the steak was very disappointing this time we actually left most of it - such a shame as it was a birthday celebration meal"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin- up! :),positive,40,20-Sep-16,"This is another outlet of the now closed Shinkei, which was previously at Toa Payoh. The menu is generally the same, with a few slight additions to the barbecued section. Service staff were very meticulous and efficient, always clearing the tables the moment they see empty plates. The manager, Winnie, is very polite, and she is very attentive to details. Remembering the preferences of the customers, she will show initiative in helping them attain their orders quickly. Well Done Shin Minori, all you need now is to have more promotions for loyal customers like me! :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Service!,positive,50,8/9/2016,"The food is really amazing, as its freshly prepared and extremely delicious. We did have a small issue with the sambal chili used (Because it smelt wierd on the bass) but overall the experience is really amazing.

Park right out the front and Ideally go next door to Red Dot (see photo) to have a brew or a cocktail first. Sit at a table the garden and listen to the birds - it’s rustic and we love it and we were treated to an approaching thunderstorm yesterday without the rain...bliss.
French,L_Angelus,Better service then rumored,positive,50,7-Aug-14,"We were invited to this restaurant by a collegue who lives here. Wether you choose this restaurant or another, this area is vibrant and lively. In the weekends they close off the streets from car traffic and the restaurants expand their premises to include the street as well. A beautiful area neighborhood with two story buildings called shop houses. Our friend said early that the food is among the best but the service can be up and down. On our visit - it was impeccable. When looking for a champagne we were offered to try a glass before ordering a bottle. We ha the sea bass tartar and escargot as starters and the veal for main. It all tasted superb. And for wine aficionados they had a very nice collection to try from. Bottom line - I have read the other reviews but our experience was top notch."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Excellent for South Indian cuisine in Singapore,positive,40,12-Jul-13,"Excellent restaurant to get-together with family and friends or to eat by oneself. Curried and fried chicken, mutton and fish are very good. Tends to be crowded during weekend evenings but one may reserve a table."
French,Saveur,Great French food!,positive,40,9-Oct-16,Value for money for the duck confit! They revamped their menu end up I preferred the previous pork belly thou. The creme brulee was excellent too!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad service,negative,10,15-Mar-17,The staff can only converse in mandarin. Last order was made known to us at 2130hrs and closing time is 2230 but at 2200hrs their staff were all packed and waiting at main entrance to close the restaurant. Feels so unwelcomed.
French,Saveur,"Great food, nice ambience at very affordable price",positive,40,9-Jan-16,This is my first visit to Concetto although have been to Saveur several times already. The festive set meal is quite limited but we have option to order from a-la-carte menu too. This might not be possible during Christmas period in other restaurant. Overall the food is very delicious and will definitely visit again.
French,Saveur,Nice and cheap!! ,positive,40,1-Oct-16,"You won't get disappointed at Saveur, good food with good price!!

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not so good anymore,negative,30,1/3/2016,"Must have when in Singapore, Chilli Crab.Jumbo is fully reserved one week ahead, so no choice, we have to settle for Long Beach. This is our second time here after a year.We book table inside (Aircond) but when arrived was told no table inside so have to sit non Aircond table outside. Since they are packed all the time, its take it or leave it.As tourist, well, we have no choice!We order Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Fried Kangkung.Chilli Crab is good but not as good as before. Standard has drop. Black Pepper Crab is spicy but nice. Well, the meal cost SGD 305 (with GST) inclusive of Chinese tea and desserts, rather expensive! But it satisfied our Chilli Crab crave :-)"

Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","Great Choices, fabulous location",positive,40,14-Sep-13,Excellent choices unlike Chennai. Serves wide range of north and south Indian cuisines. Prices are slightly steep but that is to be expected in Singapore

This place is affordable and delicious. I've taken large groups here and they handle it beautifully. We love that we live close enough to be repeat customers. The setting is very very royal and food is great"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Fast and decent Chinese food. Don't expect a long leisurely dinner!,negative,30,03/19/12,"For fast and decent Chinese food in the ever-crowded Holland Village, it's hard to beat the massively popular chain, Crystal Jade. From fried rice to dim sum, it's consistently good and the service is wickedly fast. That means, however, you'd not be able to enjoy dinner in a leisurely manner, hold hands and stare into your spouse's eyes lovingly. It's strictly dine and dash here. It's my default place for Chinese food when in this area if the crowd gets a bit too much - which is often. You do have to wait on busy nights, but the lines do move pretty fast."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Extremely good, but atmosphere and wooden chopsticks",positive,40,31-Mar-18,"No complaints about the food,perfect! Missing is though a bit of atmosphere it’s just empty rooms with chairs doesn’t help creating a good conversation. For a Michelin star restaurant having wooden chopsticks...."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steaks, attentive service, quite expensive",positive,40,12-Apr-13,"After three days of mostly asian food, a colleague and I decided we wanted red meat. This restaurant has quite a small interior but plenty of space outside.Staff were attentive, steaks were fine. My rib eye was a bit too fatty so a fair amount of waste. My colleague had an entrecote which didn't look like it had been rested properly because there was plenty of blood on the plate by the time he was done. But he seemed happy enough.The bottle of wine we had was fine but expensive. Overall, fine, but not outstanding given their prices."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",good choice for hawker center,positive,50,1-Sep-13,"clean, convenient location, non offensive /aggressive barkers, over all good choice, Not sure if true but we were told this is only open at night"

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good food but service can be better,negative,30,29-Apr-17,"Used to go there a lot but now very occasional .. taste is quite ok though may not compare the original Madurai taste esp main Madurai specialities like idli, jigarthanda .. also slightly more salty (almost all items) .. service needs a lot more better...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",decent variety of japanese style food but could be a better experience,negative,30,29-Jul-17,"the place looks a bit crammed because of the way they arrange the tables and seats. order via tablet (which crashed a couple of times). sometimes they miss a few items in the order. called for service (via the tablet) but no staff came over. slowly in clearing dishes. sashimi quite fresh. other hot items are quite average. some came piping hot, some came a little cold. noisy on a weekday afternoon. stated last order at 2.15pm but staff came to remind us last order at 1.55pm."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, cheap eats!",positive,40,1-Aug-12,"We were recommended to go there, we had great food but wished we had of been stronger to stop Restaurant owners approaching you (although there are signs that say they cannot). It all looks good but you have to enjoy the hawker style eating outdoors to feel comfortable. It would be even better if you could speak their language! I wished we had eaten at the Crab place but maybe next time. Taxi to get home to Hotel was a bit of a wait. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect food,positive,50,19-Nov-17,"The place looks deserted from some distance but when we went inside, it was full of people.

The food there are nice, such as chicken rice, Hokkien noodles, satay, and seafood. But since the seafood price don't show on menu, they charge tourists more. Make sure you compare the price before you order!!!! I am serious!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Not that great,negative,30,13-Dec-15,"Ordered the famous hot chocolate and it was really very good. Tasted like real chocolate. Just too rich and sweet for me, suggest to share someone if you do order this if not might have sugar rush. I also ordered the lorraine quiche which i thought was really over priced. It tasted like it was microwaved. Nothing special. The salad was very little, just tossed carelessly with some sauce, maybe balsamic vinegar yet doesnt have much taste. The nicest thing on the plate was the cherry tomatoes which i can get from supemarket. So yeah, i am not impressed. "
French,Poulet,Affordable French Cuisine,positive,40,26-Mar-16,"I had the Poulet Roti with Mushroom Chardonnay Sauce, the Tiramisu in a bottle, and the Creme Brûlée. The price was not too pricey yet I could smell and taste the truffle mashed potato that I had along with the entree."

Great service as you grab a table which is numbered, order your food and drink and they bring to your table freshly cooked. Satays, calamari and chicken wings were yummy. The satays so delicious that we ordered another batch of 50 amongst a family of 5. Relaxing outdoor setting on a balmy night eating Satays and drinking ling neck Tiger beers and the kids drinking freshly squeezed juices was sensational and very reasonably priced."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cosy family dinner away from the city,positive,40,10/20/16,"The set dinner menu was excellent for a table of 10 and we could not even finish it all! Had to 'doggie bag' the left overs.The ambience was great and what was more excellent, was the attention being paid to the us by the service staff and especially one of the staff - Shirley Sun. She was a great and pleasant host to us all! She was quick and pre emptive to know our needs and wants which she never failed to deliver within a prompt amount of time.The food was good, not excellent but enough to satisfy our love for chilli crabs!I will visit here again with my family!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lovely Food,positive,40,9/3/2017,"We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for 5 nights, but only ate once at one of its restaurants - Peach Blossoms - after reading Trip Advisor reviews. We chose off the menu, rather than having a fixed menu, and found the food to be very good, as was the service. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Dim Sum,negative,30,08/27/16,"Foods were average, location at level 2 easy to find the place

The place is good to pit stop for snacking..before you continue your exploration at famous Chinna Town."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",$53 National Day promo or not?...,negative,30,2-Sep-18,"Went for above promo. Ordered sake for 2 pax, orange juice for another Pax. Service staff aren’t keen to serve 2 sake bottles, despite the tiny bottle size. Therefore they prefer to waste time running to-and-fro. When we requested for 2 bottles instead of the unnecessary running about, we were told : per table having the same drinks were only entitled to 1 bottle. To the management of shin minori; does the $53 promo means it’s for per Pax or per table?Have better business etiquettes, train your staffs better , to upkeep the service standards. For the template replies of “reduce wastage” , why not , for such future promo , introduce a wastage chargesas well?You are risking negative words of mouth , and a permanent loss of re-visiting customers with such inflexible tiles.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good value steak,positive,40,5-Sep-14,"Very decent steak for the price. The strips are just the way they should be and you probably either love it or hate it, thin, content less and a little bit like chewing paper. The steak on the other hand was lean, without tendon but tasteful. Avoid the heavy sauce and just go for the steak and walnut salad."
French,Saveur,French Food Birthday Dinner,positive,40,9-Oct-17,"The other reviewers were spot on. The food was delicious. Definitely try the foie gras and salmon confit.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally not worth it!,negative,30,12-Sep-16,"Nothing to shout about.....food was alright, not fantastic. Over rated & overpriced!!!!

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum high tea time,negative,30,12/5/2016,We were on our honeymoon when we visited Singapore in Jan 2015 (can't change the year so have put 2016) and this was our first meal that we had picked prior to coming to the city. It was very highly rated among others in Chinatown so we decided to give it a try. We tried a lot of their dimsum and it was good but I wasn't impressed. Service was also a bit slow so I was little annoyed. Overall i'd say it was an Ok meal.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good Chats, but on the expensive side",positive,40,30-May-15,"For a gujarati vegetarian in Singapore this place is like heaven. Variety of food options and some pretty good chats.If you like cholle bhature, you should try the different variety of bhaturas served here.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Just Like Eating in Paris,positive,40,6-Jan-17,"I'm a big fan of the Paris chain Le Relais de L'Entrecote, which offers a simple menu of salad, steak and frites along with a mustard based sauce. Well, Singapore's L'Entrecote absolutely nails it! It's not as good as it's Paris counterpart, but pretty darn close. I wasn't disappointed, and would go back anytime. They have a decent wine list, as well. "

French,Saveur,Food was not very tasty,negative,20,9-Mar-17,"Second time here because the first time round I misread the terms and conditions of the chope voucher and ordered the set meal. This time round, the service of the stuff wasn't very responsive or friendly. Didn't feel very welcome by one of the female waitresses. Food was pretty bland especially the sea bass that I had. Funny how the potatoes had more flavour. The pasta appitiser was the only thing worth the money out of everything I ate that day. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One choice,positive,40,1-Oct-17,"French to the core. Only one dish, steak frites. Both came out perfectly cooked as ordered. I would've preferred to forego the sauce on top, but my wife loved the sauce. Horses for courses. Massive amount of crispy frites. Feed two armies on them. Not cheap, would not want to spend that much every night."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sorry Les Bouchons,negative,20,25-Mar-18,Sorry my friends. You lost your magic. Once an excellent place for steaks in a nice atmosphere by the river. So what has changed ? Service ! Or lack of service. I was there on a weekday for a casual business dinner. Plenty of staff but we had to call for attention several times. Very inexperienced waiters. Good wine list with fair pricing (for Singapore standard) restaurant was 20% full when we visited. Please work on your training program and I’ll be back.

French,Saveur,Food taste good and affordable but service average,negative,30,9-Apr-16,"You don't get the welcome greetings nor look as you step in. We were there for snack but no sandwiches except mini mushroom soup and mini small pasta which both taste good. Soup served in a tea cup size. See my photo. But ice lemon tea was served super sour and I had to request for a change. Waitress said they made a mistake of 3 parts lemon and 1 part sugar instead. Oh well, if you are just passing by and it's not crowded. Hop in. But won't make a trip deliberately just to eat there."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Classic hawker food,positive,50,21-Mar-12,"Great all-round hawker food experience. Food is good and reasonably priced (though make sure you check prices in advance with the vendors!)

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",perfect morsels of sushi,positive,40,1-Sep-12,"easily one of the best high end sushi restaurants in singapore, the freshness of the fish is incomparable, and the temperature and texture of the rice is intentionally perfect. every morsels brings out the best of the ocean flavours. patrons are seated around a large sushi counter apparently carved out of one piece of wood though i thought the lighting seemed a bit bright. people talk in hushed tones in reverence to the zen-ness of the place. its interesting they dribble some soya/mirin dressing very lightly over every piece of sushi, but sometimes it does seem a bit salty for my liking. it is not cheap so best to go for lunch as there are 3 sushi sets from $75-180, and the omakase at $250. i hear that at dinner a similar omakase goes for $450. having been to sushi kanesaka in tokyo, which was simply mind-blowing with the variety and quality of the fish, shinji would suffice for folks not able to fly to japan for a sushi meal."
French,Paul,An Oasis,positive,50,17-May-17,"I stopped for a late morning coffee after some frenzied power shopping. Paul is an oasis of calm in the busy centre. The coffee is good, as is the range of European cuisine on offer. I will definitely be back."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of stalls but mostly same type of food,positive,40,21-Sep-15,"Very big food court with lots of stalls. However most of stalls sell the same food with same price. I'd say you have about 4-5 stalls that sell seafood, 4-5 that sell brochettes etc. very nice ambiance. Place is amazingly clean considering the number of people and size of the place. Beware of people at the entrance guiding you to a table. Since they are selling mostly the same food, they literally jump on you to sell you their menu. If you refuse to buy than start the insults...i cursed at the dude for being so impolite and on my way out he started the same manège with other tourists... Other than that enjoy the food!!!"

An expensive experience but worth it.

It's a good place for a business lunch as they don't hang around getting you your food, but equally don't hassle you out the door as soon as you're finished. Will definitely be there again (in two weeks in fact!)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Slow Service,positive,40,13-Sep-18,"Went there with colleagues on a weekday lunch. Plenty of parking in the building.Food was relatively good. Sashimi was excellent. Thick juicy slices. Shrimp Tempura nice too. Sushi was average. The Chopped Tuna Belly Sushi was horrible. We left them mostly untouched (and was told by staff not to waste food).Service was acceptable but very slow. We waited almost 45 minutes for some dishes. After chasing for some orders in vain, we placed other orders, thinking that the earlier orders were lost in transit. But they all arrived together at the end, forcing us to eat when we were already full. All in, we were there for close to 2 hours.We ordered the a la carte buffet at $43.90++ each. Ocha at $1.90++ not included. With Entertainer app 1 for 1 main course deal, it worked out to only $28 per person. Not a bad deal. I was told similar offers are available on Chope. Come here if you like sashimi, have an offer and 2 hours to spare. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Nice variety, great value",positive,40,6-Mar-17,A good variety of Japanese food at a great value! Come hungry! Be sure to make a reservation as they are always full especially at dinners.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit,positive,40,30-Jul-16,"Many, many years ago, the hawker centre was at the Orchard Road in front of Cold Storage supermarkets. It still has a similar vibe. Chinese, Malay, seafood.... Clean and true food. A definite must visit!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of food,positive,40,2-Mar-17,"As per other reviews, the food were all pretty yummy , especially the crunchy maki! Serving of the food was also fast"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Decent crab...Not so decent servive,negative,30,05/23/13,"As a huge seafood lover I was dying to try the famous crab on offer at Long Beach. I was not completely disappointed but not overly enthralled either. Inviting some friends visiting from Sydney to dine with us we reserved a table outside. On arrival we were greeted by a cacophony of noise from the incredibly crowded dining room and were relieved to escape to the relative calm of the outdoor seating. Once we were able to locate a waitress we ordered a staggering amount of dishes (we were all super starving). Crab, lobster, prawns and other sea dwelling delights were ordered in abundance. It was probably a good thing we did order so much as from that point on all the serving staff seemed to disappear. We would have had a tough time requesting any more dishes. Anyway, on to the important bit...the food. Some dishes were borderline delicious others a little more mediocre. Stand outs included the famous black chilli crab and wasabi prawn. To be perfectly honest though I have had much better.All in all Long Beach at Dempsey definitely has an air of mass production and tourism about it and the service leaves a lot to be desired! I would eat there again but I believe this restaurant may have had it's hey day."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average,negative,20,06/29/18,Foods taste average. Nothing much special. Environment is a bit smelly unsure why. Not crowded. Easy accessable. 
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","Good food , simple and fulfilling ",positive,40,28-Jul-17,"This vegetarian restaurant is opposite Mustafa centre in little India and is also open 24 hours , the place is very popular and bustling with crowd in rush hours throughout the day, food is simple yet fulfilling and taste is authentic South Indian . Lots...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Food,positive,50,7-Feb-16,"This is a must visit place for Indian vegetarian food lovers, there are plenty of options ranging from Chats, Snacks and main course food. Don't forget to have the masala chai here and of course don't leave without satisfying your sweet tooth :)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique hawker center,positive,50,1-Jul-16,"OK, it is influenced by tourist, but still authentic enough to be recommended especially noting the location. It is a 15 Minute walk from Orchard corner Scotts. Too bad that no authentic Laksa place remained after the recent Renovation. Washrooms much better now."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner,positive,50,26-Jun-17,"Feels the same since we came in 2012. Definitely much improved order taking system which is fully automated!
Food definitely improved!"
French,Paul,Best pastries in Singapore,positive,40,26-Aug-14,Went there for breakfast. They simply have the best pastries in town. The breakfast is actually a good deal by Singapore standards.Zero atmosphere specially if you're sitting outside. It is in a huge shopping centre where the shops open at 10:00. Paul opens at 09:30.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Food,positive,50,04/30/15,"Found the restaurant when in China town,my friend ordered and what a fabulous Dim Sum lunch we had. Was introduced to some really different food.The menu was large ,food was hot in temperature ,good service,friendly and typical Chinese atmosphere,thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Restaurant was busy with Chinese and Europeans.What a treat and will definitely go back on my next visit.The Singapore noodles were wonderful which is one of my favourites and a huge portion.It certainly was worth it."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good food - God ambience,positive,40,9-Aug-16,"In a row of restaurants opposite Mustafa centre, this occupies prominent place. The meals at 7.5 Singapore dollars is a steal. Even the mini meals was good.
Food is tasty and service is good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lack variety but excellent for the signature duck dish,positive,40,6/4/2015,"Went for the famous Signature duck. Fatty and juicy and reminds me of the roast goose in HK. Would be even better with the plum sauce but the chili paste is a good replacement. However I find the signature black pepper duck bun to be more special with the kick of black pepper spice. Make excellent alternative to Tim ho wan style bun. The wonton noodle is not bad at all, so is the char siu (glaze pork) and the roast pork belly. All in all makes a wonderful lunch. However as they are new, the operations need to be more finetune. Wrong sequence of orders, long queue at the register counter etc, but I am sure they will get this right soon."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overwhelming ,negative,30,1-Nov-14,"Went for dinner one night on the recommendations of friends. It's outdoors and even at night is hot! You walk in and it is overwhelming there are so many food places!!! The second you sit down you are swamped with people giving you menus telling you to eat at their food stand which we didn't like, we wanted to walk around and browse before we chose but it was almost impossible with people heckling you!! The boys decided on Chilli crab, nasi goreng and chicken and rice which was amazing and not expensive compared to home! Chilli is put on everything so make sure you make it very clear if you don't want it, they won't remake a dish or give a refund! At least the whole coconuts with straws were a great respite from the heat. "
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Charged for Food tasting!,negative,10,3-Sep-18,"Charged for food tasting which I had already committed to order! This is absurd! The food differed greatly when it was catered for my Dad’s birthday celebration. Average taste for north indian dishes.
Extremely disappointed, do not order from Riverwalk Tandoor!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average Chinese meal,negative,30,02/27/17,Lacks a bit of flavour. Good wasabi prawns. Chillie Crab was average have eaten better. Razor clams were good. Good tea.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very good value high quality meal,positive,50,3-Sep-18,"Very good value (coupled with Chope’s discount). Starters, mains and wine all very well priced. Will definitely visit again"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only worth it if you got birthday voucher,positive,40,6-Nov-17,Abit pricy at $40++ for weekday lunch buffet. Sashimi and sushi are nice. Only worth it if one of you has the birthday voucher.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very pleasant experience,positive,40,22-Nov-16,"We were there to celebrate friends' birthday. With a total of 10 people, we were given a nice room. The food was fresh - i love the sashimi. The rest of the food were great except for some grilled/ bbq items which were very dry and hard to chew while some orders were forgotten. The service was great as the staff came in to check on us. The price is reasonable and we will definitely go again."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice spin on roast duck : Dim Sum ,positive,40,7/4/2017,Chanced on this in the basement of the high end mall after deciding $26 is too much to pay for a hot dog no matter how hipster the coffee shop is ! As a 'ang mo' local slang for a white guy I'm not an expert on dim sim & roast but you can taste the difference between here and equivalent or even more expensive places. London refers to the imported duck they use and it's a singapore restaurant rather than a franchise of a Hong Kong chain like some others.Overall well worth a try I recommend the pepper duck bau and the roast pork :)
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Not quite what i expected,negative,20,14-Aug-12,"Went with friends for a birthday celebration, well, without the birthday cake thingy.It was my first visit, not knowing what to expect. But the reviews on this site says great stuff!The food was by far, just average. We have had better, but one certainly can't expect much for a S$46++ prime rib for 2! starters were below average, escargot had too much oil, the salads which came with the rib were full of mustards, fries were great as it was served hot. Skip the desert if you can, totally forgettable.Took about 30 mins for the main to arrive, we ordered 3 sets of prime ribs with various done-ness and an additional main to share, we were given fries enough to feed 10. We are well aware that the fries are free flow but the servers seemed to be conditioned in such a way that all accompanying fries need to be served with the mains, regardless if the table was overcrowded for more plates or for this case, baskets of fries. My point is, if the fries are free flow, come as when it is required, they do not need to arrive at the table with the main when there were more then enough fries. The servers do not seem to understand it, and they seem to be constantly under pressure, not sure why but they all look indifferent and definitely not too happy to be working there. They were amateurish at best, and didn't know what to recommend or even to caution if we have over ordered, which we did!The restaurant was full but i am not sure if it was just me, it was terribly hot and stuffy in their, definitely not a pleasant atmosphere. While the prime ribs looks pretty reasonable on the menu (S$48++ for 2 persons), the total bill didn't tell us that, it was close to S$600 for 6 persons. To be fair, other that the 3 prime ribs, we had king prawns (S$40++), a bottle of wine (S$105++), 2 coffees, a scoop of ice cream, escargots, caprese and creme brulee. OK, this was a case of us over ordering, just a note to self not to repeat it if i am to come back here, or try their better outlet on Club Street. (By the way, we came to Robertson Quay as Club Street was fully booked)Tip for those who wants to visit, the rib is big enough for 3 or even 4 if you are a small eater. The fries should be sufficient to let you walk out of the restaurant feeling full."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Underwhelming - there must be better restaurants in China Town,negative,30,3/6/2018,I was really underwhelmed about this restaurant which is a shame as there are so many other places nearby which I passed to get here!The restaurant is well signed posted but so be sure to look up as the restaurant is located on the second floor. It has air conditioning which is a plus.The staff were as helpful as they could be given that their English was so limited. We struggled but found a way to communicate.I found the food very oily. My spring rolls were literally dripping with oil which was not very appetizing. As for for the rest - it was okay - average at best.I would not return simply because there are better places out there.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",don't change what is not broken ,positive,40,24-Oct-15,"Newton was my preference to go to after flying in to Singapore on a Friday evening. As a child my parents would use to bring us to visit . Not much has changed ., there are plentiful of choice, Chinese food. Indian , Malay and old favorites plus seafood n great dessert stalls As usual the eye was bigger than the stomach ! We have grilled sting ray with chili sambal - the best ! $12 The satays 80 cents each with min order of 10 sticks were good ! Fried egg oysters, Chinese style fried carrot cake n Indian mamak style fried instant noodle was on order tonightPlus durian ice kachang ! N freshly squeezed sugar cane juice , Great n tasty on a warm eveningLove the fact that you order what you like, choose the size you want and they bring the food to you . Most of these stalls are long time vendors and will still be here for many years to comeAh Newton .. We will certainly be back "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Can try,negative,30,12-Mar-17,"Food was serve slow during lunch time. Service with service crew is OK, but the front counter not so welcoming."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful place for a group or family meal,positive,50,11/30/17,"Spurred by good reviews on this site, a group of us went to Peach Blossoms for dinner. The location is great with potential views of parts of the Singapore skyline (not the best parts though) and the pretty Marina Mandarin interior hotel lobby. Menu is extensive (and expensive), service excellent, and interior decor attractive (but not romantic). Place was full of groups/families; didn't see couples. Food was very good. Try the avocado/chocolate ice cream dessert to conclude your delicious meal. Strongly recommend reservations."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This is a must try.,positive,40,16-Jun-12,"My husband and I went to Newton Hawker Centre last Sunday for lunch, and were recommended by this Chinese stall to try their Rojak. Do not be mistaken, this is not the Indian one, but the Chinese style. The Chinese one is quite unique, with pineapple, pear, and you tiao. The portion is quite big too. :)"
French,Paul,Ms,positive,50,16-Sep-17,"Wow good food. I ordered pan fried salmon with 2 side dishes and it was really tasty and delicious. But it's more high end prices. Good ambience and easily accessible. Located at famous Takashimaya mall and near orchard mrt. Service staff short handed, need to ask 3 times for a glass of water to come. I enjoyed my lunch very much there. It was my first time to patronise the restaurant and I will go back again."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good experience but once is enough,negative,30,16-Apr-15,"At the cost of 300 over dollars per head, I thought I would be served lobster, tuna belly or some horse meat sashimi. But none of the above. Instead , I get run of the mill type of fish like red snapper, tuna , yellowtail and octopus. But to give credit to the chef, the fish served are really fresh and the sea urchin (uni) has got a tinge of sweetness rather than the salty taste usually associated with it. Service and ambience are acceptable. Overall, the quality of food served is good and I never thought i'd say this but the best part of the meal was the fruit dessert. The honey melon was outstanding. It had this soft, translucent texture and tasted of bubble gum and wine. Unfortunately, the portion was small and it left me wanting for more. I would recommend this restaurant only if you or your loved one are celebrating a special occasion and want to splurge. But for the price, for me, once is good enough."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Another Great Meal,positive,50,04/16/17,"We had family Easter lunch at Long Beach and it was another great meal. Food was very good - chilli crab was not too sweet with a nice bite, cereal prawns excellent, crispy squid a must. Service was excellent and Toni who served our table would be one of the best I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much effort and all with a wonderful smile. Well done!!!"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Mini meals!,positive,40,5-Jun-17,Good mini meals. The only trouble in this place is getting a table as everything is self-service. Its quite crowded at meal times.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exemplary Service from Restaurant Manager,positive,50,03/17/17,"Booked the place for dim sum lunch under the Meritus card voucher - giving me 30% discount for food, a bottle of wine and a cake. To my dismay, I was informed the voucher cannot be used for the buffet dim sum. My pre-selected white wine, Sauvignon blanc, was also not available at the restaurant as they only serve Chardonnay. Both were not told to me when I booked the restaurant via the card concierge. Fortunately, Mr Alden Goh (Restaurant Manager), noticed our unhappiness and turned the situation around. He explained the terms of the voucher and although the restaurant does not carry Sauvignon blanc, he made arrangements for us to have it (instead of the Chardonnay). He also made sure that we are well-attended to throughout the lunch. Although, we still could not take up the buffet dim sum - took ala carte, the food was of good quality and the entire dining experience went really well. I must say that the service we received is exceptional, thanks to the exemplary service from Alden. Thank you!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A Let Down,negative,20,26-Jan-17,"Was looking forward to have a value for money dinner and great company on Tuesday, 24. But was it was a total let down. Thank God the sashimi was fresh and they were generous with their servings. If you are not a sashimi fan, you may wanna give this place a miss. I must say they do have a good variety on the menu for the amount they charge, but.... the bunch of us would rather go for value and quality to variety!Most of the grilled items we ordered were so tiny and dry in texture and some of them are cold!!!! We were sooooo totally mislead by the photos in the menu. Oh ya, if you are conscious of salt intake - this is not the place for you either, their cooked food is en general to the salty side. We wanted to put in a special request but the tablet that has a remarks xolumn doesn't allow us to do so. Food came fast but the service were not up to standard. There were 8 of us with 3 tablets (it is obvious that they have linked the table to fit our number of pax) and we ordered using different tablets. To us, it's basic knowledge or only logical to serve the food to the table where the orders were keyed. But 2 of thier service staff did not do so. They just dumped the food at one side and expect us to pass on. The level of basic service should be up in this. Overall, it was a disappointment for me and it shall be my first and my last to visit this food chain. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice restaurant,positive,40,30-Jun-16,"Food is tasty, just they didnt included dessert in their buffet menu. And not so satisfied with the octopus sashimi."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",North Indian Vegetarian Food,negative,30,26-Sep-17,Good restaurant near to Hilton. The food and service quality was average but lots of choices are available. The ambience is good with many staff.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Nothing special,negative,20,2-Jun-16,"Reasonable curry taste, fish head not that fantastic , cause its steam and add on curry sauce. Not value for money, but worth trying for first timer. Careful its quite spicy."

Chole bhatura was tasty
It is located close to Mustafa centre."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Great as usual, but stale bread!?",positive,40,7-Oct-17,"We came here again with family who were in town. The menu changes by the season and the choices were interesting, though we were happy the singature dish of uni was still the same. There was a lobster bisque-like dish which was delicious and I wanted to soak up the last bits with a bit of bread, but the bread was stale and rubbery. I couldn't believe it. I love this restaurant but I was really disappointed by the stale bread, simple thing but at this price point everything should be great and this was a big fail for me. Otherwise the rest was great and the sommelier was excellent, but since our first visit two years ago, I feel the quality has declined just a bit."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Terrible terrible behavior towards customers,negative,10,9-Oct-16,"Place no doubt has good South Indian food but customer service stinks.

French,Saveur,"Friendly service, good food at reasonable prices",positive,50,29-Apr-17,"Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the time we were at the restaurant. Loved the signature duck confit, as well as the appetizers (foie gras & truffle fries). A wallet-friendly restaurant to visit if you are craving for nice French cuisine without burning a hole in your wallet. :) "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",By far the best sushi & sashimi in Singapore!,positive,50,25-May-13,"I never knew sushi can be so delightful that with each mouth it makes me actually stop and savour the art behind each carefully prepared pieces of sushi and the freshness is undoubted. Exquisite! I usually avoid most ""tomago"" at sushi places and to begin with I am no fan of eggs but this is not that case when i head to Shinji, the tomaga has no ""eggy"" taste to hit and the texture is slightly springy and compact. The uni or sea urchin is creamy and makes me ignore my cholesterol levels. The chefs are fun and they do try to engage you in small talk, and sometimes you get to see the fun side of them when someone celebrates birthdays. I must say it comes with a premium price tag but in my opinion if you are craving for excellent sushi then you can't go wrong with Shinji."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value-for-Money Japanese Buffet,positive,40,11-Aug-16,"We visited on a public holiday for buffet lunch. The restaurant was full-house. It might be best to place reservations in advance. The food was fresh and delectable. We especially enjoyed the sashimi, yakitori selection and various maki creations. It is best to place orders for most of the items you want at one go. Subsequent orders take awhile to arrive or might be left out, possibly due to shortage of manpower. Other than this little inconvenience, we were pleased with the quality and variety of food. I will certainly return again with friends/family for fuzz free Japanese fare. The bill for our lunch buffet (4 persons) added up to approximately $185 (including drinks). "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good!!,positive,40,11-Jun-17,Food was good and fresh. Staff were attentive to arriving guests. Food was good - really recommend the fresh sashimi!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Brunch spot - cantonese style,positive,50,01/14/16,"I enjoyed every visit I had to Yum Cha restaurant. The Dim Sum dishes are not oily nor too salty. I recommend all their steamed dishes and also the custard buns. The Chinese tea served is of good quality too. We spent SGD68 (including service charge and GST) on 12 dishes, a pot of tea and the peanuts/papertowel. The place is very noisy though it seems to bring you back in time to the old days of Singapore, or feels like in Macau dimsum cafes."

The waiter did not know what a flute was-which is part of their breakfast choices.Later, when they served the omellette they forgot the bread!They don't ask if you want anything else.The lady working behind the bar making coffees and juices and serving out the pastries to wait staff is wearing 6 inch heels!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated,negative,10,12-May-12,"The food there is good, however, prices over there are way above the usual prices. Try other local hawker centres such as ""Chomp Chomp"" at Serangoon Gardens, Adam Road Food Centre or Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The food at these places are comparable to Newton Hawker Centre, in fact, some might say better, and the best thing is, its prices are cheaper and more..authentic. "
French,Saveur,Decent food at affordable price,positive,50,26-Dec-16,"Went with a group of 6 adults and 2 kids, chose this place as it's kids friendly.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet,positive,40,2-Aug-16,"Sashimi was great! basically the menu was quite limited, pricing wise, 2 pax for close to 100 bucks.The service staff was alright, few of them spoke loudly in canto.There was also a bbq station, and of course there were burnt smell from time to time.Hope they can improve on the menu, some of their special dishes are ala cart, I mean, i'm paying so much, they can at least have one complimentary dish per person right?"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Expensive Tourist Trap,negative,20,3/8/2016,"We hope this place is merely resting on past laurels, and hasn’t always served food this undistinguished and pricey. It’s not that the quality of the food is bad - it’s fresh seafood after all so how badly can you mangle it? — but the prices are stratospheric and the portions small. The pepper crab is the signature dish and for $50 for a medium portion, there was not much of it. (It’s brought from Sri Lanka.) A small side dish of a few pieces of broccoli was $12. The ambience is nothing special - a bit chaotic actually (which wouldn’t have bothered us if the food were more memorable). It seems to attract wealthy residents and people on expense accounts (for whom $200/four not including alcohol is normal) and tourists - who think they’re going to get something special (that was us). Give it a miss. There is much better food to be had in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for a quick cheap eat,negative,30,13-Sep-16,There is plenty of choice and the food seems fresh. Its very tasty and everyone is catered for. Definitely worth a visit for a cheap eat.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Avoid Stall 46 Jian Ha Seafood BBQ - major rip off.,negative,20,6-Jun-14,"The hawker centre was busy on a wet Friday night and had limited 'free seating' as most tables were for diners of a certain stall. 46 said we could order from other places so that suited our group. We had no complaints about the food: string ray, chili crab, 4 prawns and fried rice. The menu indicated prices but we were not asked or advised to the reality. $8.00 per 100 g it said but they claimed $80 for 4 prawns- $20 a prawn!!! Served with plastic plates and forks. I'm sure they were not over 200 g per prawn. It's too hard when they have been eaten. We asked for a small serve of the sting ray but were charged for the large. We also asked for a small crab and that was $40. That didn't seem too bad but to hand over $60 per head for a meal on plastic plates, wet ground and tables seemed a real rip off. Tourists beware. Ask for proof and cost. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Unhappy With the Taste,negative,30,28-May-17,Went there little early in the evening.Had a high expectations from the food because we tried earlier other outlet which is near to Mustafa.Ordered Gobi Manchurian. It came out to be Gobi Pakora style stuff (coated with lots of flour) which was awefull in look and wasteful in taste .Then we ordered Pani Poori . Not bad - StandardLater we decided to try Bhatura. Which was ok but not too good.Since Start was bad and mood was spoiled with Gobi Manchurian this we decided to stop there and could not order main course .Little pricy and could not find worth it for the starter quality.I might not visit this place again because there are a lot of places nearby which gives better taste.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Leaves a bad taste in the mouth ........,negative,10,19-Dec-09,"Dire. We've eaten at Les Bouchons in Club Street many times and always had great food and service. These standards are not emulated by the Rive Gauche restaurant in any way. After an hours wait I was served an American rib eye that was 75% fat and was clearly a very bad cut. Despite being summoned discreetly so as not to cause any embarrassment the waiter and management refused to accept that there was any problem and were extremely condescending and then became very rude. This was a simple issue about a bad cut of meat. It happens and it's just one of those things that restaurants know how to handle because mistakes do occasionally get made. It should be no big deal. Yet something that would have been so easily dealt with in any other restaurant was blown out of all proportion by two arrogant, small minded individuals who clearly need a refresher course on customer service. The attitude of the management is so staggeringly bad that Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is officially the worst restaurant I have been to, anywhere, ever. Vile, absolutely rotten."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place to go for crabs,positive,50,04/29/16,"We went there after a long day in the meeting and by 8pm they were full. Good that we have reservations. Of course Singapore is famous for their huge chilli crabs but this place also serve white peper crabs. Maybe for me chilli crab is now common, I kind of like the pepper crab more. It comes with additional white pepper sauce for those who likes the strong pepper aroma. My colleague who is vegetarian had to watch all those shell cracking but he insisted that his fried rice and shitake mushroom with beancurd were all very tasty too. The meal is supposed to end with a great dessert in durian pudding but unfortunately they ran out of it and we had to go with the mango pudding, which was good but you know, its not the king of fruit."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive but explicit ,positive,50,4-Aug-15,"The level of quality here is too dream for in Europe. Our chef was explicit and professional. Service and food was perfect. The only minus is the high price. The ""big"" omakase is expensive, but with a menu including 4 kinds of Uni, you will expect this. Sake was absolutely great. Best sushi experience outside and maybe inside of Jspan. "

The food is delicious and they serve us with just a quick click. The staff which is Terry, Amy and Nobel was friendly and the service was the best I ever had. I will come often to have my breakfast, lunch and dinner over at Peach Blossoms again. If you ever to to this place, do look for them."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",AT $41.90++ PER PAX FOR DINNER YET NO FREE WATER!,negative,30,2-Oct-17,"This review has a good rating.I must have visited at least 6 times in the last couple of years. In awe for the first few visits but not last night. My son’s second visit and he said he will return. Perhaps my expectations were higher or I didn’t enjoy any ambience there. There was none to mention. Sashimi especially the salmon, yellow tail and sword fish were fresh. Some maki and skewers were good. But a couple of dishes were very salty. Service was lacking. The vegetables tempura was the first few items my son ordered and did not arrive until the end of our dinner. We had to remind them at least 5 times because each time we were told another 2 or 3 minutes.It is already quite pricey and yet water is chargeable at 80 cents and green tea at $1.90. I can’t. Personally, I won’t go back but if my son wanted to, I will go with him. And I didn’t even take any pictures last night."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chili Crab experience with friends,positive,50,04/24/17,Chili Crabs by the sea in Singapore! We had both the pepper seasoning and the red sauce. I liked the red sauce with the rolls best. My husband liked the pepper version so we were glad we ordered both. We were glad we wore the bibs because this is a messy experience! You have to work for your food. Wear clothes you intend to wash afterwards.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Tasty and delicious food,positive,40,31-Dec-16,Good and balanced list of food selection. We were led into a VIP room near the main door however the shoe rack for 10 persons and many carton boxes have produced some odour. Hope this can be improved.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food is good - service and decor average,positive,40,6/12/2017,Don't get confused with Hestons London fat duck - the food was good and obviously popular with locals when you see the long queue for takeaway. The decor is tired and a bit scruffy bu the food was good.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Market,positive,50,29-Jun-15,"We were told the Newton Hawker market or Newton Food center was known for its seafood. We ate here twice for dinner and loved it. We tried chili crab, BBQ stingray, satay, garlic naan and craft (also draft) beer. We went one night at 6 and one at 7 pm. It really seemed to pick up during that hour. At 6 you have a choice of table but at 7, the temperature is cooling off, more stalls are open, our preferred time. The satay was 60 cents with a min of 10 satay. However, I was able to eat 20 satay alone! The chili crab was around $35SD and the BBQ stingray was $22SD. Both were very good. We were surprised by how much we liked the stingray. We weren't bothered by people trying to show us their menu. We just kept walking, grabbed a table and my husband went from stall to stall ordering for our family. We also at at Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell Hawker centers and this was my favorite."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crabs-BEST!,positive,40,7/11/2014,"Long Beach@Dempsey is one of my favorite restaurants to entertain my overseas friends. This restaurant is very popular among locals and tourists and best to make reservation. It gets really busy during dinner time so be prepared to wait for a table, for walk in customers.I always order black pepper crabs which Long Beach is well known for. A few of my favorite and familiar local dishes are : fried sambal kang kong, roasted chicken, Fried beancurd, sauteed prawns with salted eggs and baby squids. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide Variety,positive,40,13-Jun-17,Impressed with the wide variety of choices at their ala carte buffet. Glad that they serve single portions as well to reduce food wastage yet allow one to taste as many dishes as possible! Service was very prompt too.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Chili and Black Pepper Crab with history,positive,50,03/19/17,"Pros- Best black pepper crab for the money- Food overall is great for the price- Beer is cold and perfect after a long day in the Singapore heat- The restaurant sits on an old British military barracks, so the look and feel is original for the island and the entire shopping area sits on a hillConsiderations- Price: Like any place that serves these massive crustacean delights, be ready to pay around $90-100 SGD ($64-70 USD) for one- Location: It's a little off the beaten path, but still super clean, friendly, and where all of the locals eat- Reservations: Make a reservation if you can, because the place can be in full swing on a Friday/Saturday evening."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bet you cant stop licking your fingers !,positive,50,16-Jul-17,"Best Taste !Good Service !A Vegetarian Delight !One of the best Restaurants in Singapore. Never miss if you are in Singapore.Very popular with the local Indians as well as tourists, so one may need to wait a bit to get your table,especially in the evening. And the wait a get a little longer during weekends.But the wait is worth every minute.A bit expensive compared to other Indian restaurants ,but the taste and quality of the food served compensates for it."
French,Paul,Reputation is not enough...,negative,20,12-Mar-16,"Come on guys. Sitting there, alone, for 15 min, looking in the eyes of staff members at least 20 times, no coffee, no food, waiting to order - and yet no one (!!!) is asking what I need or if I want to order anything. Coffee is good and pastries are even better - very good. But as long as the service is cold and not friendly a cafe is can't be a good cafe. Cafe is an overall experience and this one failed. Even just a small cup of water or, better, a little smile, could grant a third star."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Far better than I'd anticipated,positive,40,20-Mar-11,"I had heard this was a bit of a tourist trap, but was favourably impressed. If the tourists like it, it's for good reason, as the food is really, really good and really, really cheap. We were the only westerners the afternoon we went though. The centre is nice to look at, a large wooden structure surrounded by greenery. It's arranged in a circular pattern of food stalls, very clean, with outdoor seating areas under overhead ceiling fans. The food is spicy and delicious. Do go and try it."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chili & Pepper Crab Experience in Singapore!!!,positive,40,06/16/14,Having visited Singapore many times and not had a chance to try this must have experience I made sure to tell my friends to put in our must do list this time!!! The toss up was between Jumbo and Long Beach with many friends being either fans of one or the other ….. The one we went to in the end was Long Beach … the Dempsey branch as both Jumbo and Long Beach have multiple branches ….. The Dempsey area in general has really developed into a great area with eateries and cafes bustling throughout the day and the night. The two must have dishes the Chilli Crab with the fried Bread and the Pepper Crab we ordered of course with extra pepper sauce on the side (which you have to order separately to dip the crab in for the full experience). Apart from these two dishes we ordered the butter prawns and the steamed sea bass in soy sauce. The place itself is one of those mass production eateries which have a formula and do large turn arounds and fast service …… The food started to arrive pretty fast and we put on our bib's and picked up the crab cracking utensils and got to work !!!! The Chili Crabs and Butter Prawns came first …. the Pawns were really good and hit the spot …. the Chili crab a bit Challenging to get to the meat for a first timer but once you did was definitely worth the effort. The Fried bun with the Chili sauce was also really really good ….. The Pepper Crab ( we ordered the black pepper …there is also white pepper crab which is supposedly also pretty good) which came had a completely different flavor and the friends kept asking which I liked better …. my answer was i liked the variety both were excellent and the combination was amazing ….. the steamed sea bass with soy sauce was also good but both the crabs being the hands down winners ….. A definitely must do experience in Singapore!!!!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,mmm mmm mmm mmm,positive,40,02/21/16,"Yum Cha has become my favourite dim sum restaurant in Singapore - buzzy atmosphere, Malacca style tables, trolley service, great dumplings and grumpy staff in the middle of Chinatown. Perfect ! You can also visit the nearby temple if heading this way. The dumpling pastry is excellent and the range of fillings pretty good - the one downside from this diver's view point is that the restaurant still offers a couple of dishes with shark's fin. Ho, hum. Is everything good ? No, I was disappointed by the cheung fun and the lotus leaf wrapped rice got the thumbs down as well. You may have to wait for a table at peak times but the turnover is quick and the queue orderly. Note that there are three ways of getting to Yum Cha, which is on the first (second in Singapore) floor, if you are laden or have a push chair - the stairs, and round the corner either an escalator or a lift. The well chilled beer is by the glass or by the pitcher, and tea is a good, non-alcoholic alternative. When you are starving and the trolleys arrive too slowly you can always ask one of the staff for the plates that you want and, if the sauce is a little for your taste just request some chopped chilli in soya. The greens of the day are fresh and cooked to order. Oh, and the price is very reasonable - maybe half that of London's Chinatown."
French,Paul,Middle of the (Orchard) Road...,negative,30,23-Jun-12,"I spend some time with friends sampling food at Paul's...it's located, conveniently, right in the middle of Orchard Road at Ngee Ann City, better known as Taka!In short, it's a salad place, the service a little of an afterthought and the name more of a hype. The queue is long and the food is just not great. The tables are placed close together and an overall sense of claustrophobia is prevalent. However, try the salads, they are fresh and creatively mixed with prawn or chicken and make for a good healthy stop-over break from luxury shopping."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Positive feedback of very good staff service by Peach Blossom Restaurant,positive,50,4/9/2017,"We have double birthday celebrations for my dad and myself at Peach Blossom Restaurant.The staff, Terry, Soon Teng, Akira and Christine served our table with utmost sincerity and earnestness to let us feel welcome. We let off our guards and spoke freely with them as if I had been a regular customer. But this was my first time there and I want to go back again for more occasions. Other staff Alden and Mun Fong smiled to us even though they were serving other tables.Special mention and praises to Terry who wrote well wishes calligraphy on 2 plates for my dad and me. He crafted dough figurines of a pig and shou gong for me and dad respectively. I will show pics of his masterpieces. He took great pain to wish us in the most appropriate poems.Christine read out his poetic phrases and sang birthday songs.They left indelible impression in our birthday celebrations. Kudos to Terry n Christine on the extra mile of services and special thanks to Akira and Soon Teng for their dedicated services."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great for Seafood!,negative,30,21-Mar-12,"As a local, this is a great place to come for seafood and a beer. It has a busy and noisy ambience, making it great for people spotting. However, the stall owners and touts can very pushy and bothersome, despite attempts to prevent such actions. The 1/2 dozen entrances/exits are also permanently 'manned' by smokers meaning you can't get in or out without a lung full of second hand smoke."
French,Saveur,Standard has dropped,negative,30,11-Jan-17,"Used to frequent this place when it first opened. Food is still value for money however standard has dropped. Cooking of the food and taste has dropped from what I remembered it to be and so has the portions. Still a value for money meal, but not as great as what it used to be. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible attitudes,negative,10,2-May-17,"Horrible attitudes of staff and even the branch manager. Refused to let us change table even though 90% of the tables were not used for the rest of the evening. When asked what buffet includes, service staff says ""Everything"" but in fact it only includes what is listed under buffet tab. when asking the female branch manager(?) questions, she wasn't even facing us when she answered, and worse, answered in an agitated tone. Honestly worst experience ever in a restaurant. Felt like a kopitiam standard."

But this Paul in Takasimaya takes the cake ad the worst. Customer service is practically zero. No body actually services you. Its a game trying to get attention of a waiter .And they don't actually look at u when they take an order ,serve . The waitress just dropped the cafe on my fable and rush off.To add to insult, the coffee we ordered were diluted. No coffee taste at all. Both the Caramel Latte and Cappucinno.And don't order the Surprise dessert. It is a surprise as the cream brulee is nothing like it. And the macaroons are so soft u have to chew into it.Worst Paul every been. Hope they really improve a lot. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Super bad experience,negative,10,19-Aug-17,The female supervisor service is very unprofessional. Show black face & very rude. I don't understand how can such a person can work in a Japanese Restaurant & in a supervisor role.
French,Saveur,"Duck Confit or ""counterfeit""?",negative,20,1-Aug-17,"Had lunch with my daughter on 31 July 2017. Mainly because I had a $20 Saveur voucher. Just as well I had the voucher because with just 2 entrees and 2 glasses of water (@30cents), the total bill came to $38.""Well that's affordable fine dining."" one might say, Sadly, the only reason it was affordable, was it was not very fine.While my daughter's chili crab & squid ink spaghetti was tasty, the portion was hardly sufficient for a decent working person's lunch.It was a good thing she was a genteel eater so we both finished at about the same time. If it had been me, it would have been gulped down in 5 mouthfuls.Now to my duck confit. An objective description would be ""The driest piece of duck's leg sitting on powdery mash, with a tablespoon of sauted mushrooms by the side."" I'd more aptly call it 'duck counterfeit'.Perhaps the ambience, or lack of it prompted us to defer ordering dessert until later. So rather than risking it, we decided to look for dessert elsewhere. This turned to be fortuitous because we happened upon a great cafe in Takashimaya - but that's another story.Suffice to say, my first (and, I think, last) visit to Saveur was a great disappointment. Affordable? Yes. Fine? far from it. Sufficient? {stomach still rumbling)."

I had been there 30 years ago it would be similar, then it was very much like to the seafood marking where we could choose our own food and They would cook it in front of you. However it is quite different now and the selections are very similar across the board. It was hot and could not find a table so we left. It was quite cheap however."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Elevated Contemporary Japanese....good, but not great.",positive,40,24-Aug-15,"Tetsuya Wakuda as a brilliant chef brings me back memories of my time in Sydney in 2000, so when I saw his restaurant in Singapore (back in 2014) was on the top 50 list, I needed to go! You have to meander above the casino floor to go to the restaurant, but once in you are transformed by the decor. Very stylish, very sleek. You are ushered to a room where there is about 8 chairs in front of a teppanyaki cook top where you chef prepares all sort of delightful dishes. It was very entertaining and inspiring to watch the process. The presentation was spectacular and visually very appealing, but the flavour (especially after our dinner at Andre) it was not great, mind you it was very delicious, but I guess I was expecting transcendence. Would I recommend the place, sure but maybe as a second or third choice of restaurants in Singapore. The food was wonderful, but I guess my expectations was a little too high."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese food at its best,positive,50,16-Nov-14,"This restaurant is in the Raffles building but is not officially part of the hotel. I went to have a look in the afternoon with a view to eating there that evening by myself. They wanted to know where I was staying and how to contact me before they would make the booking. I can understand that they might be worried about people not turning up as it is an expensive restaurant. Be prepared to pay a high price, but if you love Japanese food as I do, this restaurant is paradise. The food is prepared in front of you and every mouthful is a sensual experience and a work of art. With Japanese food, you think you will never be full, but after many little dishes, you begin to feel that you have had your fill. I ate mostly fish dishes, from little orange jewels of salmon roe to octopus. I don't drink alcohol and my bill came to 353 Singapore dollars, but I had no regrets as it was as good an experience as any of the attractions in Singapore and one that will live with me for some time. The kimono clad ladies ready to assist at every moment were delightful and the chefs are artists of great skill. "
French,Saveur,Good service and ambience,positive,50,22-Sep-17,"Staff were very friendly. Took the 3-course dinner set. Appetizer and dessert was very good and worth the value. Main course sadly was a disappointment. Still, price paid was affordable for the location."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fine dining in Little India,positive,50,28-Oct-15,"Authentic Indian food is the highlight of the place. Though it is a bit pricey, but the taste justifies the price. Chaats are yummy."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unpleasant experience at Shin Minori,negative,20,2-Aug-17,"The service was bad - preferential treatment for those having the ala carte buffet. When my family and Indonesian family friends were there last weekend, we were advised after being seated that our food would arrive in 20-30 min because they will service those going for the ala carte buffet first. As we were using the Entertainer app, they told us that the free items would be the chawanmushi after seeing that we had ordered it. We then asked whether we could cancel the orders since it had only been a few minutes since we ordered. However, we were informed that it was too late because the chawanmushi had already been prepared and was about to be served to us. The chawanmushi for ala carte buffet goers is different because our chawanmushi contained a prawn. As such, I would not recommend going to this restaurant unless you want to go for their ala carte buffet. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Classic steak et frites in a relaxing environment,positive,40,8-Sep-16,"The location of this restaurant is so relaxing which memories of old Singapore. The menu is pretty simple with steak et frites front and centre. And why not, for a once in while unhealthy meal with unlimited chips? House wines are good and the wine list boasts a few gems. Staff were friendly and attentive. Don't call to book a table - they don't answer their phone?! THe lemon sorbet with limoncello was a nice way to finish the meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious Crab,positive,40,5/8/2014,May Linn was our amazing server here. Friendly and welcoming. The food especially the black pepper crab was amazing. We also had the crispy duck which was equally outstanding. The restaurant was busy but we got seated within 5 minutes. Amazing experience and right in the centre of Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Singapore food,positive,40,01/20/14,"A friend took me to this restaurant to have lunch this afternoon while I am visiting Singapore. Good food being served there. Very authentic. I went there in the evening with my wife in the evening in the same day. We has deep fried oyster and lobster. Very well prepared food. If there are four of you, I would suggest ordering a crab dish. A lot of visitors around is ordered this dish but since there were just two of us, we ordered lobster."

As it is a buffet, we are glad that they ensure the portions aren't too big so that we could taste and try more items. Ambience was fine as well - quite cozy and not too crowded on a Wed night. Service staff was helpful too. "

Various other items ok - cold ramen, edamame, sushi, chawinmushi. Service was quick. It's quite pricey for an average place."
French,Saveur,Simple evening in town,positive,40,1-May-16,"Visited this restaurant with the GF over the Labor Day weekend. We were quite satisfied that the place was peaceful and allowed us to enjoy a lovely conversation over dinner. We ordered Saveur's Pasta for starters to share, and Chicken Roulade and Pork Belly for mains. The food was as expected: simple, affordable and definitely value for its price. Overall, we would recommend for anyone looking for a simple and unpretentious meal with their SOs."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Idli at its best,positive,50,1-Sep-12,"This is another place which I have been waiting for. Its such an irony that I have to visit Muraugan Idli in Singapore. Idli was so hot and soft, just melted in my mouth. The 4 varieties of chutnies and the sambar were too tasty,...More"
French,Poulet,A cuisine is not just assemble ingredients in a plate,negative,10,21-Jun-15,"Went to the Chinatown Point branch.First time I tried a ""French"" cuisine, and it is disappointing. We order half a roasted chicken that they are famed for. The chicken tasted bland, and at most, it is only warm, not hot. I suspected it was micro wave before serving, (the chicken skin is soggy as well). It was served on a big plate of mushroom cream sauce, but, when dipped with chicken, the cream overpower the chicken taste. you are effectively eating cream.Second dish is Duck with red wine. There is no taste of red wine in it. Again, the duck thigh is lukewarm, soak in the so called red wine sauce. The duck taste bland too, and it is too dry and hard. and quite an obvious smell of frozen duck. Both dish is a typical example of, just assembling ingredients together in a plate, and called it a dish.Where has all the culinary goes?Paid about S$16 (before +10+7 %) for above each dish. Though the ambient is ok, but not worth the eat. For foreigners, there is a food centre just right behind Chinatown point mall, plenty of good food there, get a half chicken, or half a real roast duck, and eat your heart out."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Excellent South Indian Food,positive,40,25-Aug-17,"Visited in end Aug 17. This place has some of the best Idlis that I have ever had (even in India!!!).

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,negative,30,14-Nov-16,"For the food, most of them were delicious and well prepared. Each dish comes in a small portion, which is good because you don't have to eat too much and can order other dishes. If you like that dish, you can always order more anyway. The waiters and waitresses were excellent servers. They are professional and friendly, not to mention interactive. They talk to you and understand your needs, rather than those 'follow the books, scripted words' kind of server. However, when the restaurant gets busier, they attended to us slower and the 'call for service' on their ipad was not working (or they are ignoring it). Atmosphere was okay, nicely decorated, however the seat we got was a window seat and it started to get very warm after a while."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed with the steak & fries,negative,20,20-Jun-16,Six of us went for dinner at their branch in Suntec. The medium raw steak is so tough it was a struggle to chew. Not worth the price. Also the fries were skinny.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So Parisien,positive,40,27-Sep-17,What was excellent is just how people can combine great quality with little choice. Good steak with excellent sauce. And no nonsense about wine. Not something like what kind of wine so you want? No Bordeaux otherwise go somewhere else. Had a very enjoyable evening with a reasonable bill. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch,positive,50,10/30/17,"It's was my first time visiting this restaurant and celebrated my friend's birthday.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good eats,positive,40,29-Sep-14,"If you aren't a local then be ready to be bombarded with hawker stand owners asking you to eat at their stand. We came for chili crab and we got a feast! We paid about 80 dollars for crab, fried rice and two jumbo shrimps. Not sure if that's cheap... But it was good! We ate at hawker stand 46. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great food!,positive,50,22-May-17,Food was great. It is my 2nd time there for their buffet. Love their sashimi platter! Would definitely go there again in future.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Went downhill,negative,30,4/5/2018,"We used to live in Singapore three years ago, and Yum Cha was one of the places we'd go to get good local Chinese food. The atmosphere used to be lively, as it was full of people. The food was still good, but there were only three other tables occupied throughout the time we were there for dinner. There are better places to go now. Sadly, it is not like it used to be."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Surprised Indulgence!,positive,40,5-Oct-13,"Tucked at the 2nd floor just above the smoke-filled Marina Bay Sands Casino the discreet door led us to this exquisite fine dining of modern European-Japanese cuisine. As guests of a surprised birthday gift specially planned by a very thoughtful hubby for his wife with some of her good old friends, we savoured the signature marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar, and Wagyu with Wasabi and Citrus Soy, the superb birthday chocolate mousse cake and lobster in the 10-course degustation menu. They are very good with a very deep pocket! Go all the way with a special room overlooking Marina Bay for a spectacular view of the daily 8 and 10 pm laser shows! Memorable indulgence with good friends! Thanks for a lovely evening!"
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Really??!,negative,30,26-Oct-12,The fish head curry was just ok. After a lot of hype I was disappointed that Muthu's was just ok. Also the fact that it was a wasted chance at eating somewhere better in Singapore that hurt...

French,Paul,Poor service,negative,20,20-Sep-18,"I have had food from Paul's for takeaway in the past and love the food. No complaints there. But recently we decided to sit down and eat.. over 30 mins before someone served us, even though we asked 3 different people who said they would come soon. We only ordered cakes that were all ready made, took over 10 mins for them to arrive at the table, and drinks order was wrong. The staff were polite enough but seemed to either have too much work to handle or need better systems in place to make it run smoothly."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Splendid Dining Experiences,positive,50,10/11/2018,Booked a table for 12 to celebrate Nephew's ROM. We had a wonderful evening on that day! We enjoyed the awesome food as much as Terry's innovative and surprised gifts to the wedding couple. Thanks to Terry's arrangement for the food menu and we loved all the dishes. The service was efficient and attentive. Plates were changed as soon as it gets a little messy. We never have to worry about tea top ups! Thanks to Terry and his team for an unforgettable evening!

French,Paul,"Lousy steak, horrible service. Avoid if possible",negative,10,24-Mar-17,"Ordered tenderloin steak. Taste horrible. I could get better steak at cheaper price elsewhere.What is even worse is the service and attitude of one staff who served us.We selected some pastries from the pastry counter to be served later. However, they first said that pastries ordered at counter is for take away only (when i been here few months ago and ordered from counter to have it at the table). Then, after checking at counter, they didn't know what we ordered. Lousy food and service.Will never patronise Paul restaurant again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent!,positive,40,11/10/2013,"What a difference getting a private room makes! We had a party of 10 this time, and the service in an air conditioned room was exceptional. Food is perfect, as always, prooer crab to die for, and the rest to match. There was a snag with the restaurant running out of bibs, but they came to the rescue with some linen towels that perfectly protected our light shirts from flying cracked crab parts."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overcharging and touting.,negative,10,21-Mar-12,"Too noisy, too expensive/overpriced food. Not recommended."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,awesome choice of restaurant especially if you have guest from overseas.. pricey but damn good!!,positive,50,02/14/17,"my favourite is the lobster cook 3 ways, black pepper and white pepper crab and order the chilli crab sauce by the side to dip with their special buns.. also the kampong mee goreng.. a must go place when i have client from overseas!"

There was plenty of space at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan (they used Rittenhouse 100 rye), which was made perfectly. In addition I ate some Wagyu beef, which was spectacular. The service was exceptional."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Pricey, but worth it!",positive,50,19-Jul-18,"Delicious seafood and great service, but for me the wagyu was really the star of the show! It is 10 courses and then some delicious desserts. Pricey, but definitely worth it,especially if you have only been to this caliber of restaurant in the US and Europe."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Just another place for the casual visitors,negative,20,01/21/14,"The location is good for visitors not knowing very little about Chinese food & culture. People who really like Chinese food would easily find better offerings elsewhere in a lot of food courts and eateries. Service was good though. Definitely not a suitable choice to bring your friends or guests, unless you are really very very hungry and happen to be nearby."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Be careful on the per 100g prices,negative,30,20-Apr-16,"We lived close by for quite a while so we went here now and again, the food is ok but its so easy to spend a lot if you start ordering what they are famous for - seafood. Many of the prices are per 100g and the cost quickly adds up. Its worth a visit but you definitely need to confirm the price before you order. The vendors will let you run up a bill before they let you know"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best North Indian food in Singapore!,positive,50,10-Oct-15,I've eaten at many Indian restaurants and this is by far the best for North Indian food. Have eaten there twice and excellent food both times. Their chaat especially stands out!
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak restaurant,positive,40,30-Oct-16,Met a couple of friends for dinner as it had been recommended. Menu offers mainly steak but there were a couple of alternativesWe all had rump steak which was served with chips and a side salad. I ordered medium rare and that's exactly how it was served. A delicious streak beautifully cooked and every relish to accompany it was offered.
French,Paul,Ants inside the food,negative,10,27-Sep-17,"I totally cannot understand. It was my first meal. I ordered a course menu so a basket of bread was served. After I take one of the breads, I realised that there were ants inside the basket. When I informed this to a female, she apologised and told me that she will bring another basket. However, I did not want to eat here anymore so I told male staff that I do want to cancel the order. I only had a sip of drink but he still wanted to charge me. I asked him to put the drink in take away cup but I didnt feel like drinking so I threw away. It totally ruined my day and I just wasted money. I will never ever visit here."
French,L_Angelus,Bon Appitite,positive,40,2-Jul-12,"Went to L'Angelus for the first time on Saturday evening. Over all experience was good and food was excellent. Some minor issues with ambiance to note:It was Saturday evening around 9PM. A couple walked in wearing flip flops, beach short and tank tops. I was surprised the restaurant did not tell them they were not dressed appropriately. I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant and spend over 400.00 ( for 3) sitting next to people who look like they should be in a hawker centre. The restaurant should consider the feelings of the other guests. Some are there for special occasions and this just put a damper on it. Also, the wait staff and maître d left the restaurant before we were finished and after we had paid. (11pm) We were only finishing up our coffee. Felt a bit slighted to see the maitre d across the street at a martini bar after we left L'Angelus. It would have been nice to be thanked for our business and made to feel like our evening was complete.Iif you are looking to impress an important client or someone special - this may not be the place to take them. My humble opinion."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good,positive,40,2/8/2017,We ordered chilli crab with mantou it was great. For the fish it was supposed to be steamed grouper but we asked for fried fish with sauce n it turned out not too good thou. The service is good and staffs are very friendly. It's better to call for reservation before you come to the restaurant as it's often full house. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",It was ok,negative,30,2-Oct-16,Went for buffet lunch and the food was served very slowly for all the tables.It was only later that they discovered that orders did not went to the kitchen. It was resolved later on.It wasn't a fantastic experience taking to account what was being reviewed. Variety of food for buffet is not wide in my opinion.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best birthday present!! ,positive,50,6-Jul-14,"Surprised that I experience the best Japanese food in Singapore!! I went to so many Japanese cuisines across the countries, even in Japan. Absolutely this is one of the best and high-end place. It will def satisfy foody's sight and taste.

French,Saveur,Good food at low price,positive,40,5-Apr-17,"Generally their menu price is at a lower end as compared to other restaurants. However, they serve very nice food. Value of money!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food acceptable but bad service,negative,10,31-Aug-18,"Their reception to birthday voucher redemption is kind of unwelcoming.We happened to have 2 good friends whose birthday fall on the same month.So we dated to go out together. Understanding unable to be at same table, we requested fortables side-by-side. They cooked up a liar to say all other tabled fully reserved by customers already and placed our 2 tables far away from one another! Perhaps they are not really magnanimous to offer birthday voucher celebration. They forget the other party is still paying full price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Highly Recomended.,positive,50,27-Feb-17,"Some of the food we ordered wasn't served. Very nice environment, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall the food was very good! Highly recommended!"

Not fine dining but perfectly decent food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Take care in ordering and enjoy,positive,40,13-Jan-12,"This place is now a bit of a tourist trap - but you can still get good, cheap food if you are careful. If you are going to order any seafood - make sure you know how much they propose to charge upfront. The fried kuay teow is always good value and delicious, as is the chilli stingray. Wash it down with some chilled tiger beer and you have a perfect late night meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Too Commercialised,negative,10,8-May-18,Visited Newtons Food Centre tonight. Very dissatisfied. So over commercialised its lost the Songapore charm and feel. Vendors are pushy and disinterested in being polite and happy. Food very average or not good. Can't say much for this place or any of the hawker centres we've heard so much about. Wouldn't recommend or return to any of them sadly. Visited Singapore a couple of times now and have to the food is definitely not as it used to be
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible Terrible Terrible....a full grown dead Cockroach in Curry,negative,10,20-May-14,"We visited this restaurant on 13 May 14 at around 2100 Hrs, We went to its branch at Kailash Parbat Restaurant, 93 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207669 for dinner and ordered a platter of Chhola Bhattura, Hyderabdi biryani and plain yoghurt.To the worst of our experience, when we just started eating and had half a bhattura,in chhola curry I found a big dead cockroach. We reported the same to restaurant manager and he had no explanation other than just sorry. It was a major hygiene issue and even I had starting symptoms of mouth ulcer after that food.Me and my family were really very very upset with the incident as we are pure vegeterian and could not have food that night. My 6 year old daughter slept hungry that night. It spoiled our night and my daughter could not have food properly throughout the stay in Singapore in any of the restaurant due to the same suspicion.We reported the incident to the hotel admin (Mr Amit on admin@kailashparbat.com.sg sales@kailashparbat.com.sg) that night itself but his response was again just a sorry. Terrible restaurant and average food....."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food Good Service,positive,50,1-Apr-17,The food is delicious and they have a wide selections for their buffet. Their service is fast too. Will go back again!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tiger Prawns & Stingray,positive,50,5-May-16,We have just spent three days in Singapore and had lunch at the Newton Hawker Centre twice. The tiger prawns cooked with lots of garlic and the stingray with a hot sauce were fantastic. Had them both days. Beer was also pretty cheap with a big bottle of Tiger only $7.50 (compared to what you would pay in a bar or hotel for a small bottle). Definitely recommend.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the duck and buns. Forget the rest.,negative,30,06/21/15,Singapore hawker food is hard to beat. Fat duck buns are tasty although a bit too sweet for me. The duck has enough taste and texture to warrant another visit if you are around the area and need a quick duck fix. The char siew deserves be a mention but is priced more than its weight in gold. Long live the hawker centers!! 
French,Saveur,Christmas Menu Not Up to Standard,negative,20,26-Dec-16,"Reserved a table for Christmas, as I enjoyed my previous experience at the restaurant. However, the recent visit was disappointing - chicken consomme was too bland, ""medium-rare"" beef was almost raw and the plate was full of blood with a charred sides & the lobster pasta tastes like your usual $3 hokkien mee. Their signature duck confit would have been a much better choice."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lousy experience,negative,10,8-Jul-18,"Was there to celebrate my kids birthday.Waitress could not understand english, and chose to ignore us upon seating us at our table.Our orders was missing in the system, asked for the manager, was again ignored.Wonder what kind of training was given to the wait staff, if at first you don't understand the guest, just ignore them?! Saw other tables guest, was waving for wait staff for service, and with visible displeasure as we were.Our bill came up to abt $200.00++, this is not a budget buffer, mind you.Was awarded favorite restaurant by bloggers, that is why we were there.Guess you have to be a blogger in order to get service.First time in my life, have to find food to fill up my stomach after a buffet lunch.Never again, will I step foot into this lousy restaurant."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good steak!,positive,40,11-Aug-18,"I went here many times and also another restaurant on Club street, every time I ordered a ribeye steak.

Very reasonable price for food and wine, staff were efficient."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very good seafood restaurant,positive,40,06/21/16,"Dempsey hill with all the restaurants, pubs and clubs is a very nice place to visit. During our last visit in Singapore we went to the Long Beach restaurant. The food was very good. We had the famous chili crab and several local dishes. We enjoyed it very much. Prices were also quite reasonable. Also for the beers and wine. Wine and beers can be very expensive in Singapore restaurants."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection of food,positive,40,10-Nov-16,"very worth and value for money even though it was quite difficult to locate.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great service ,positive,50,5/7/2017,"Our family had birthday celebration at the restaurant. Good food, great time. Service really good.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,From top to flop,negative,20,17-Feb-15,"It makes me sad to write this review as I was visiting l'entrecote since it opened. However, I realised that the quality got worse over time. My very last experience yesterday was quite special indeed. When I sat down at the table the guys on the table next to us warned us not to order as the food is terrible. Sounded like a very strong word to me so we decided to go ahead. I had bone marrow as a starter (as always), which was within my expectations. However, the salad was served at the same time, which was quite quite special (especially given the fact the the service was exceptional in the beginning). Later on when the entrecote was brought to the table I saw immediately that my rare is not rare but medium well as they meat is already carved. I tried a bite and realised no matter how this meat is cooked it wont be one of my enjoyable. I mentioned to the staff the overdone meat. She offered to get me a new serving, which I rejected due to the fact that it takes another 10 to 20 minutes and my friend already had his food. My disappointment was the fact that I was served carved meat. It's one look and the chef or the staff serving would have realised it's overcooked.Anyway, this was the first time in probably over 20 years (or possible ever) that i did not finish a steak. I felt very sad as I had quite a few good dinners with friends at l'entrecote and I knew the moment I walked out that i will not be back soon."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Undisputedly good sushi,positive,50,20-Jun-16,"Our sushi experience here has set the bench mark for future endeavours!Service was superbly good. Hot teas were promptly refilled, the placement of the ginger on the serving plate was switched upon finding out that my husband was a leftie, and not forgetting the hilarious party get-up that the chefs adorably put on to sing both of us a birthday song! Plus points there!The food was amazingly good (even better than the ones we had in Japan). The uni sushi was so creamy that it melts and slides down your throat.We understand from the chef that they fly in the fishes from Tsukiji market 4 times a week! Freshness guaranteed!To Chef Takahiro Ishizawa and his team, thank you so much!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular food and spectacular view in Singapore,positive,50,21-Feb-12,"I had to email to get a reservation beforehand and the restaurant is not that easy to find. However, the meal there was spectacular and on par with the 3 Michelin starred restaurants in New York. First of all we had a private room where the chef only served us. He explained every dish thoroughly and answered any questions we had.We started with a flan of salmon row from Hokkaido served in warm soup. The roe was perfect and the flan was great. Next was the sea urchin with fresh botan ebi from Canada topped with oestra caviar. The dish was fishy, salty and tasted perfect. The shrimp tasted like they were cooked, even though they were raw, and the sweetness of the shrimp balanced the brininess of the sea urchin and caviar.Next was the New Zealand John Dory with eggplant and sumi yaki sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked as was the eggplant, and the ginger taste came through in the dish. The French foie gras with South African mango was seared and spectacular. The mango added a perfect amount of sweetness to the richness of the foie gras and this was one of best foie gras that I have ever had.The seared Tasmanian abalone with pasta and tomato sauce was cooked perfectly and was a little peppery. The tomatoes and pasta added a nice contrast to the abalone. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and arugula added bitterness to the dish. The last seafood dish was Canadian lobster that was cooked with olive oil, garlic, shallots and topped with fresh tarragon. The lobster was fresh and sweet and the broth from the olive oil, garlic, and shallots was amazing. Our next savory course was Wagyu beef with fresh grated wasabi, garlic chips and spring onion. This was the best wagyu beef I've ever tasted. The meat was cut into cubes and cooked perfectly medium rare. The fresh wasabi was mild and perfect for the meat, which melted in my mouth. The final savory course was chicken stock with Japanese snapper and rice porridge. The fish was tender, the broth was great and the rice added a nice vehicle for both the broth and the fish.We moved to another room for dessert, which was granita of Kyoto grape. The granita was very sweet and the grape was great. This was a refreshing dessert. As we ate dessert, we looked over the harbor and across Singapore. The view was amazing as was the food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Recent visit,negative,30,3-Jun-17,"The tablet to order food keep hanging a few times. Thankfully the waiter agree to take our order. When I rang to book, they told me there still 1-1 promotion for lunch using UOB. I wrote remarks on my online booking after my call, they should call me to explain if the promotion has ended before the actual dining date. We ended up paying for 4, 1 free. Promotions should be listed on website so it's clear. A bit disappointed "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A lovely meal ,positive,40,14-Oct-17,"We decided to splurge on Waku Gin with a family member one Friday evening. Being from Sydney and having all eaten at Tetsuya, we were interested to see whether the S$400+++ per person menu was worth it. The restaurant is located in the celebrity dining area above the casino. Waku Gin is nothing like Tetsuya. The restaurant only seats a small number of guests at each of the two sittings each night in rooms of approximately five. When we arrived (prior to any other guests) we were escorted to an area where we could have a pre dinner drink. We were then shown into our room where we were served our first eight courses. The guests at the earlier sitting were a mainly tourists from Asia but there were a few more local guests. The staff firstly showed us a box of examples of the type of seafood we would be eating. Most of the menu is seafood with two beef courses. The seafood came from around the world including Canada. We were then served some entrees including sashimi and their specialty uni and caviar dish. The chefs then started to cook in front of us the various seafood dishes which included braised lobster, abalone, and fish. We also then had two courses of beef (one Australian and one Japanese wagyu beef), rice soup with snapper, then moved to the main dining room for dessert. Dessert included cake and petit fours. Overall the service was very attentive and polite. The food was very fresh - the freshness of the food was the real attraction. However the restaurant felt a bit cold and soulless ... maybe because of the layout and being quite dark. It was a nice experience however we were honestly a bit disappointed that it wasn't a bit more special and distinctive. Being so expensive in Singapore, we had expected better. The restaurant seemed to lack somewhat a bit of personality. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Expected More,negative,30,05/18/17,"Spent 4 days at the wonderful Marina Mandarin Hotel . We chose Peach Blossom for our last night , anticipating a special evening . We were let down by timing and lack of ambiance. Our order consisted of 2 soups , 1 main , special fried rice & 2 glasses of wine. Our mains appeared on the table as we were eating soup. We were a bit perplexed by the timing of the service. Adding to the disappointment was a large table next to us with 2 toddlers who were allowed to noisily run around their table. Their baby was also crying. We are parents ourselves but wouldn't choose to bring children to such a restaurant after 8.30pm . While this was beyond the control of staff it showed a lack of thought and planning. The restaurant was divided into two sections . Why weren't couples seated elsewhere? Loved the view of Marina Bay sands but our $ 150 could have been better spent elsewhere. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Kailash parbat,positive,40,31-Oct-16,This is a nice big restaurant . The food is good and some is the service . We can buy sweets from here and they have a special area where we can have our personal parties .
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistent seafood quality ,positive,40,2/1/2015,"I have eaten Long Beach for a long time. It's always best to have a proper master head chef in the kitchen. I come here once a week for dinner, sometimes more often. The crab quality is usually excellent, whether chilli or black pepper. They have other great dishes, and some seasonal ones too. Call to book in advance, else you will be disappointed as they are usually fully booked. "

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Roast pork was disappointing,negative,30,04/16/18,"Brought some friends from Switzerland for lunch there. Most of the dim sum were good except for the roast pork. The skin was not crispy at all and the meat was 80% fat and 20% lean.
Prices were a little on the high side."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Satisfied!,positive,40,01/21/16,"About a week ago when we were visiting from Sydney, we were brought by a dear friend to this restaurant for dinner. I must say the service of the staff and especially the manager, Terry made our visit all the more memorable. Knowing that we were invited guest from overseas, he paid special attention and was particularly helpful in recommending the dishes of that night. To cap off a wonderful dinner, the dessert was served on a plate calligraphed with a chinese poem honoring our visit and there were two figurines of the 'monkey and goldfish' carved out of dough which were crafted by him personally. On the whole, this is a good fine dining restaurant where the service and the food are worth paying for. ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive ,negative,30,30-Dec-13,"Newton hawker centre is definitely worth a look, & the food was good without being exceptional, we had stingray, 2 king prawns, sweet & sour chicken, 9 chicken wings, seafood fried rice & 4 tiger beers.Total cost $160.00, & that was after arguing with the vender & getting a $10 discount.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist-trap food centre,negative,30,8-Sep-16,"Newton Hawker Centre was my least favourite of the 6 food centres we visited during our recent 4-day holiday to Singapore.It was hot and very busy on the Friday night we were there....the aromas of cooking food filled the air.There was nothing wrong with the food we received....in fact it was quiet impressive. BBQ stingray....black pepper crab and satay.......all were delicious. Prices were reasonable....but not as cheap as other centres.I think it was the atmosphere here that was the biggest let down for me.....all the stall holders are out the front of their stalls touting. It was the least ""authentic"" of all the food centres we visited. As a tourist......don't let this be your only food centre experience in Singapore.....there are so many better options for you to try!!"

French,Paul,Great food and lovely cakes and tarts,positive,40,21-Dec-14,"I first experienced Paul in Paris many years ago and I was delighted when they opened in Singapore. I have been here many times, but in my most recent experience I felt that they had expanded the menu and improved the food. I had the Croque Monsieur for breakfast and I think it is one of the best Croque Monsieurs I have had in a long time. Their breads and cakes and tarts are always delicious. And their dinner menu seems to have a lot more choice than before. Good place for comfort food."
French,Saveur,Saveur-ing Dinner,positive,40,25-Feb-17,Made use of their ongoing $1 pasta promo (with purchase of any mains). The duck confit with truffle mash (+$3) was really great! Tender and succulent duck leg meat on a bed of creamy mash (apparently the truffle taste was pretty mild though) served with orange slices and sauteed mushrooms. The signature saveur pasta was not too bad but not as great as I've expected. Also ordered the salted caramel lava cake for desserts which unfortunately was a disappointment. There was barely any hint of saltiness that it could be easily pulled off as a normal caramel lava cake D: 
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Crystal Jade @ Great World City,positive,40,11/22/15,"The simple egg fried rice ranks supreme comparing with the once-renown Ding Tai Fung's @ Paragon Orchard !

My expectations were set high before visiting and I must say I left the restaurant extremely satisfied. I have never tasted such delicious sushi in my entire life. These guys really make sushi an art.I tried the lunch Omakase ($250++) so total bill came up to just under $300. I marvelled at the ingredients used - all top notch. Sitting at the sushi counter watching the chef whip up our sushi was a real delight.While eating the sushi, I ran out of superlatives to describe how good each piece was.My suggestion - if you can afford it, don't even think about it. Just go."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night eats - the best!,positive,50,28-Aug-18,"There are not many outdoor hawker centres in Singapore now - this might be the last one. Great atmosphere, lots of yummy food and so very fun. It can get pricey so it's not a ""cheap eat"" anymore, but so worthwhile. It's featured in ""CRAZY RICH ASIANS""... added bonus! So cool to promote the hawkers. "
French,Poulet,Great dining experience,positive,50,2-Oct-15,We stumbled across this little restaurant and Oh my gosh I'm so glad we did. What an amazing meal!! The food was cooked to perfection. We had the chicken and lamb shanks... the meat just fell of the bone and the chicken was so tender. We enjoyed it that much we went back the next night and it was just the same. Absolutely exquisite!! A great meal for a great price. This place is an absolute must on your dining experience in Chinatown! Well done Poulet and compliments again to the Chef! 
French,Angelina_MBS,"Nice place for a hangout, not a meal",negative,30,1-Jun-16,"If you are looking for a place to have tea and hangout on a lazy afternoon, this is a good option. Food and drinks are overpriced in my opinion. You are probably paying for the service and the ambience as well. If you are planning to have food there, it is not bad, just not value for money. The only thing that i truly enjoyed was the truffle fries. Even the signature Mont-Blanc was just average. With that price, you could get much better food somewhere else. I had the hot chocolate. Rich and smooth. I would probably revisit another time just to enjoy the chocolate over a nice book or simple tea with friends."
French,L_Angelus,Fantastic French restaurant served excellent steak,positive,50,16-Feb-17,"I was there with my wife to celebrate Valentine's Day. The place is wonderful, they pay attention to the detail from decoration in the restaurant and washroom, to the tableware on the table. The waiter and waitress are very friendly and served us very well. We ordered French onion soup, escargot, ribeye steak and Profiterolles glacées au chocolat. The escargot served in individual clay pot with a piece of toasted bread on top and that's my first time eating it this way and it's lovely and tastefully. We shared the French onion soup which is just right for both of us. The Rib eye steak served with layered potato gratin and they tasted wonderful. The serving is big and we were so full after the main course but we don't wish to miss the dessert. They displaced the Profiterolles glacées au chocolat nicely on the plate and we were in heaven. It tasted so good that we want another plate, may be next time because we were so full. We had a wonderful evening and we definitely will visit again. "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What Do You Want Top Eat?,positive,50,28-May-17,"Wow. You can find anything you want to eat at the Newton Hawker Centre which is also a favorite with the locals for authentic local food. There are so many places to choose from and each one specializes in a different type of food.You just sit down anywhere there is room so be aware that you might be sharing your table with someone else but this is a great way to talk with other people. Each table has a number on it' so when you have walked around to see what you want to eat, you place your order and give them your table number and they will bring you your food.I started with some very cold beer because of the heat and then went on to some delicious stay sticks with a very nutty sauce which I loved. I then had fresh prawns with garlic butter and they were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.The Newton Hawker Centre is right beside the Newton MRT station so it very easy to get there and a two minute walk across the walkway to get there from the station.While you are there you can try some Durian fruit; often called the smelliest fruit in the world. It tastes quite nice but you do have to get past the smell.One tip: I found that the undercover area beside the cooking stalls was quite hot even though there are ceiling fans so I shifted to the open area in the middle of the center of the area which was much cooler."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with the locals here!,positive,40,29-Sep-14,"We just had a delicious family lunch here amongst the locals of Singapore and I highly recommend you do that if in town. The closest MRT station is Newton and then a short walk from there. Here is what you do: you look around the whole centre and check out what meal you would like to eat, then you go back to the shop and order from the photo (small, medium or large), they range from $6 to $24 for a plate of cereal prawns, they are yummy, just make sure you ask to peel them first. The shop owner remembers you,tell them where you care sitting and then they bring the food to your table and you pay. We chose Mr Tan from Heng Heng BBQ stall 31 and he is very humble, calm and explains all the dishes without being pushy so I recommend if you want to eat at peace and enjoy local food, go to him. We also enjoyed a cold beer as the beer is very conducive and a good way to digest the food too. There are so many dishes to choose from, we picked the green veggies, cha keow tow, pad tai, cereal prawns and the satays.A tip: take a bacterial gel for your hands and some napkins or tissues. Choose any table under a fan and enjoy!"

We knew we could order more later so we didn't order too much. And around 9:30pm a waiter came to us to tell us it was time to make the last order. So we did and order all what we expected to eat at once. Dishes started to come and then it stopped. So we asked the waiter where were the pending items. He replied that there was nothing else. We ended up with a bill of 150 sgd for 3 (no drinks) for 5 makis/sushis each. Well, that makes the most expensive sushi I ever had..The worst is that they asked us to pay before we discovered that they cancelled most of our order. And there was no refund possible - even if one of my friend had only one miso soup. The manager even told me that I will have a rebate next time but she didn't even write my name - that's just cynicism.About the food, don't expect too much. It's a Buffet so you won't get the best fish nor the best part of it. They were out of stock of their premium fatty salmon. The sashimis slices were so thick that they were hardly eatable.Definitely one of my worst sushi experience in Singapore."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb creativity and almost Perfect,positive,40,21-Jan-18,"We came in a party of 6 for dinner and was seated in one of the four private rooms with a Teppanyaki table setting. Chef was very friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the 10 course meal and if we had to be very critical, we could only find fault with the lobster which we felt the broth was overly tasty that it might have overkilled the natural freshness and original taste of shellfish. Good recommendation for pairing with an excellent sake from Ishikawa Prefecture. The signature Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Caviar was certainly two thumbs up.Services was also excellent except for a mixed up with the drinks. I think the creativity with Japanese (and also Australian) cuisines fusion were superb. Easily an Excellent rating restaurant but the prices charged probably doesn't allow any room for minor let-down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",very satisfying dinner,positive,40,3-Aug-14,"My boyfriend's favorite food court when he works here. Lots of choices from seafood to noodles to indian cuisine. We had a small potion sting ray ($12), small black pepper crab ($32), a noodle ($10), indian pancake ($4), a beer and a coconut ($11). the place is outdoor. It's a bit smoky and hot, but would like to go back for the food again!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Amazing Chaat!,positive,40,18-Jul-18,Love their Chaat items and their Indian Daals are not bad either! Go-to place for Pani Puri ! On the pricer side though. Tasty mithai / indian sweets as well. Service could have been better and seating arrangement in both outlets can be improved.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best food in Singapore!,positive,50,29-Jan-13,"Having a great selection of foods you will not be disappointed!My favourite being the Chilli Stingray, and sweet chinese buns! I was brought here by friends from Singapore and they tell me that it is the best food. There are other hawker stalls and other places you can get the same dishes - but you can get everything here and eat all at one table!Top tip - make sure you shop around, a lot of stalls sell similar foods so make sure you ask the price before you commit!!"
French,Saveur,Wonderful,positive,40,30-Aug-17,It was a delightful dinner at Concerto by Saveur on National Day! Food and ambience was just right!!!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place with varieties,positive,40,13-Sep-16,"Overall happy with their food and services but would be good if they can cut the sashimi a bit thinner as is too thick slice. Like the food varieties it offers, would love to come back again!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Meh! Overpriced, unhealthy & lousy customer service",negative,10,6-Jan-18,"This used to be a good restaurant, however of late its fallen into decline. The waiting staff don't really seem to understand how food is to be served, for example if a soup and a naan bread are the only thing that is ordered by a customer. Then bring them together.. Not bring the soup first and then leave the customer with just a naan to eat.. Such nuances are not understood.I suppose this is a rather big ask from a restaurant that claims to have a worldwide presence.The food served is unhealthy and excessively oily and over priced,.several hawker centers dish out better options in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The place to eat in Singapore,positive,50,22-Sep-15,"If you ever come to Singapore, this is the place to eat. My husband and I have travelled the world and out of all the places we have eaten, this is our favourite, it is just amazing. The atmosphere is electrifying, it's just buzzing all night long. When you get there just have a walk round the different food stalls to see what you want to eat. You choose a table, all of which are numbered and give the table number to the stall holder and as soon as you have ordered and it's cooked,they bring it over to you. You will be asked by many stall holders to eat at their stall but you can tell them you are looking around and they will leave you alone, they are really friendly. When you have finished your food you can order some more and they bring it over, you pay at the end when you have finished. Our son didn't travel with us on this occasion and he was gutted that we were going to Newton Circus because he loved the food especially sweet and sour chicken. You can buy drink after drink from many stall holders. There are toilets available which are kept clean which is a nice change to some places you may travel. You can catch a taxi just outside the hawker centre. This is a must for anyone wanting to eat with the locals, I can't recommend it enough. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Bring a towel!,positive,40,11/20/11,"We just got back from having a great evening. We were two couples dining. My husband had been here before with business associates. We had the drunken prawns, black pepper crab (2) and order of fried rice with prawn, a bottle of wine and 2 beers and it was $122 Singapore dollars per couple. The staff was extremely nice and we learned that the rice or noodle is always brought at the end of the meal. The crab is very messy to eat and we knew this so we brought a hand towel from our hotel for each person. They don't give you napkins like we are used to, but they brought us plenty of wet naps and finger bowls. If you request they will do the ""live"" drunken prawns at your table. There are lots of fish tanks in the restaurant. The flavor of the black pepper crab was delicious. It had a smoked bbq flavor to it. And we all got plenty messy. But, that added to the flavor of the evening!This was a meal not for prissies!! We all had dark ""gunk"" under our fingernails. I would return as it was just a really great dining experience. Fun was had by one and all!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent indian food,positive,50,30-Jun-17,"The best indian food in little India. After a long tiring day; you crave for a good heavy meal and Kailash Parbat is a place to go. It gets little waiting during night but its worth. Chole bhatura, chats, pavbhaji, northindian everything is great."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent Ala-Carte Buffet Spread,positive,40,9-Oct-17,"We went on a Friday lunch for the ala-carte buffet - it was quite crowded and the dishes took awhile to come. They tend to miss out certain dishes if you order a variety of dishes at once, so try to order in small quantities. Also, note that the drinks and dessert are not included in the buffet. Regardless, the staff were friendly; the best thing was the sashimi, which was really fresh and good value for money. Their sushi options are interesting and taste good too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Represents S’pore food, culture at great price",positive,50,9-Nov-17,"If you are a tourist, expatriate working here or a Sporean, Newton HC is the place to visit for a great night with friends. It had its ugly past from a few black sheeps touting food in the competitive environment but what Spore food you need to try out is here. Not the top in each category, but the variety is good enough. Bad food will self eliminate the stalls anyway... my personal preference- braised duck meat, oyster omelette, rojak, satay, fish ball soup, and of course of the bbq stingrays, crayfish etc. No specifix stalls for mention. Beside Newton MRT station"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A bit disappointed,negative,30,3/1/2015,"My husband and I visited with my brother-in-law and his partner just before Chinese New Year. We had the Hi Tea Buffet.The staff were attentive (but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant anyway). The food was pretty average. I have definitely had better dim sum in other restaurants/countries I have visited and unless you eat absolutely masses the buffet is not brilliant value for money. If you visit you will need to make a decision based on how many big eaters are in your party.I am not a big fish eater. We asked if there was any fish in the steamed carrot cake with cai poh and were told no. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted and I'm guessing from the taste that cai poh is a fish!It was an experience and we enjoyed some of the dishes - particularly the fried chicken in Thai sauce, baked mini egg tarts and chilled mango pudding!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Christmas dim sum lunch,positive,50,12/31/16,Staff very kindly helped us choose the best dim sum menu. There was also an ala carte and set menus to choose from. Very happy with our choice.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tips for a great experience despite the daunting setup,negative,30,19-Sep-14,"Went to the Newton (circus) food hawker centre.Pro's: Great atmosphere, lots of stalls to choose from, great satays and noodles, reasonable pricesCon's: Many touters for seats infront of there stalls to infer to eat from them. Prices reasonable but not cheap. If new to this it can be daunting of which stall to choose and confronting with the touting and some being pushy.Recommendations: Less hectic seating on the perimter than inside the middle plus you get any breeze/air. Less touting on the perimter.Try to choose a stall with a hygiene symbol of AWe were lucky that we sat and got advice from a local family.Our best food choices were the malaysian satays from #22 best satay stall on an end of the inside perimeter."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good on taste, but expensive - and they home deliver",positive,40,14-May-14,Had been struggling to find some north Indian food near orchard road and was advised to try this restaurant in little india. I can say it was a decision well made. The restaurant has courteous staff and decent hygiene. Normal dishes start at average of SGD 10 for main course and the menu has sizeable variety. Six of us spend around 100 SGD for main course but the food was good so didn't mind paying that much. Getting there from orchard road took about 10 minutes and its well connected by MRT. Overall a good place to eat and yes they also deliver at home...
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Food and Really good service,positive,40,01/14/17,"This was my second visit to this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Friendly staff and very good food. Their Pepper crabs are quite nice and worth the money.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",dint feel like i m out of India,positive,40,9-Jun-14,Me and my husband visited kailash parbat in Little India for dinner. The moment we entered it gave us an Indian feel. I felt like i am in mumbai and am having dinner. Usually the service in kailash parbat is slow .... I am saying this out of experience .. and the same thing was here .but the food was yummy .. we had a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the core. Highly recommended to all chaat lovers and punjabi food lovers ...
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper or Chili Crab so many decisions!!!,positive,40,4/9/2013,"Plenty of other food to choose if Crabs not your thing, but they do have one of the best in Singapore. They also will crack the crabs and get the meat out to save you the hassle. But the taste of either Black Pepper or Chili is a Singapore must try. I've tried it in other countries and it is still better in Singapore.Fried rice was a bit on the greasy side. But the fried green beans are fabulous! Reservations are needed for dinner any night of the week, lunch is easier to go in without a reservation."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Suntec Outlet - Good Food, Service ruins Experience",negative,30,21-Apr-14,"Just came back from a meal at the Suntec Outlet, didn't quite feel like it was money well spent due to the service.The food was good. Had the escargot, mussels, beef tartare, duck confit and the steak frites. They were all done well. The escargot was flavoursome, mussels were cooked just right, duck leg was falling off the bone, steak done just right. I don't see why there is a need to have excessive mounds of fries on just about every dish. Looking around, I didn't see many polished plates because of the sheer amount given.The service was sorely lacking. It started out okay, water was promptly served. However we had to get them to bring more menus for my family who arrived after me and had been seated for over 10mins. They have this thing where they write your order on the paper table covers. We were told that this was so when the dishes arrived, the servers know where each dish went at the table without having to ask who ordered it. It didn't matter anyway, we were still asked.We wanted mussels to share as a starter (it's listed as a main). After confirming twice, my escargot arrived without the mussels. We were asked a couple of times if we had been served, which was nice but nothing came back from it. And we had to call for attention to ask about it a few times more. Half hour later, they came. It was all down hill from here. Forget that we poured our own wine, and water was rarely topped up. It seemed like the wait staff and kitchen staff do what they like and not what is requested. After a while of trying to get the wait staff over and to ask for water, she preferred to start clearing our table first instead. Clearing and serving opposite the seated person at the table isn't quite nice, conversations were interrupted quite a bit because of it.We were never asked how our meal was, and the icing on the cake? We finished our meal just after 9pm, i asked for the bill from the staff topping up water in our glasses, which went ignored, then I failed at at getting anyone's attention.. They were busy setting up the tables for the next day and shutting down. I looked over at the bar, I see the manager on his laptop looking at facebook. Gave up and decided to go to the counter to make payment. Nevermind the lack of serivce attention, but Facebooking when you still have guests in? Pretty bad if you ask me.I'd be cautious about going because of the service, which isn't good when the place was about 75% full (at this time could be forgiven), but it gets worse when it's pretty empty."

Their chats are mouth watering Mumbai style chats.Must eats here are panipuri, sev puri and aloo tikki chat. It has one other signature dish also, chole bhatura.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",The best place for vegetarians to have dinner and lunch.,positive,50,28-Apr-17,Serves the best North Indian food and chaat. The chaats are a kind of kailash parbat's speciality. Apart from this the Chinese cuisine was lovable.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to visit,negative,30,2-Dec-12,"Newton circus used to be the go-to place for Singaporean suppers, but there are so many other options available now![Alfresco/Outdoors]1. Chomp Chomp Food Centre (at Serangoon Gardens) Accessible by public transport, but any self-respecting taxi driver will be able to bring you there. Small, only open from 6pm. It has the best BBQ stingray in town. 2. East Coast Lagoon Food CentreAt the end of east coast. Great place if you were planning to visit East Coast Park.3. Glutton's BayStarted by a famous food critic, , he brought together the best of Singapore tastes in one convenient spott (beside the Esplanade). Also opens till late, this is my favourite supper spot after catching a show at the Esplanade or Marina Bay Sands theatre. 4. Food Republic Beer GardenIn the footsteps of Glutton's Bay, this newly opened makan place is right beside St James Power Station, which is a great stop after a day at Sentosa. [Air-conditioned]All-time favourite: Food Republic at Wisma Atria. It has all the yummy local food like fried Hokkein mee and carrot cake. The more expensive sister brand is Food Opera, B4 of Ion Orchard."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Super poor service, bad atmosphere. Does not deserve to be anywhere near the rank it is",negative,10,07/30/16,"Was looking forward for a nice birthday dinner. Made reservations specifying this is for a couple birthday dinner. Came to restaurant, they had no reservation but got a table as restaurant was empty. We got put in a bad spot with worn furniture from the last decade with no atmosphere whatsoever and floodlight lighting. Servers were extremely non-attentive and after waiting and finally checking what's going on they were all chatting in a corner. Food came out of the kitchen spread over 15 minutes. It was hard to just have a regular meal. Either just rice or just meat or just vegetables, nothing together. BAD. Just choose one of the many restaurants in the city."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Expensive, but really good",positive,50,13-Sep-15,"This is the most expensive meal I've had in my whole life. Despite that statement, it's one of the best food I've had in my life. Since it's a 10 degustation course; we were estimating the cost of each dish, and more or less it's really worth the amount you're paying for. I enjoyed as well being right in front of the chef as they prepare the dishes in front of you. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great,positive,50,4-Mar-15,"This was a great experience with a good concept.For the savoury dishes, you are seated in a communal room that seats 4 with a chef who prepares some of the dishes in front of you on the grill. The chef was very personable and explained the dishes thoroughly and the staff provided great service.For the dessert courses, you are moved into the main restaurant area which over looks Marina Bay. The cost is $400 (not including 7% gst and 10% service charge), however is well worth it as it is a unique experience."

We felt the need for a change & wandered to Duxton Hill just up from Maxwell Street. Such a surprise to come across an area without traffic and offering an alternate Singaporean experience. Loved loved loved our meal at this little French bistro. I am not a steak lover, but I cleaned my plate! Can’t rave enough about L’Entrecote and the Duxton Hill area. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent a la carte buffet,positive,50,28-Sep-15,"One lowers his/her expectations if they go to an affordable a la carte buffet, but at Shin Minori, I was very pleasantly surprised to find really quality stuff, at unlimited amounts.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chinese New Year Eve Dinner,positive,40,02/26/15,This is our favorite restaurant for my family reunion dinner every year for the past 3 years. The food was fantastic on every dishes. Black pepper crabs is a must and never fails us with its consistant quality.The service was good as we were lucky to book a VIP room. The fish and other seafood were very fresh and of course the main lo hei dish also very good!!
French,L_Angelus,Little charming French bistro in the heart of Chinatown's Club street area,positive,40,1-Jan-15,"Great little place with extensive French wines by the bottle or glass at reasonable prices. Charming rustic decor a la Francaise and simple but delicious menu offering items such as Croque Monsieur, goats cheese tart, Croque Carillon (goats chees and bacon), lovely assortment of cheeses - small or larger plate -, crusty French breads, generous salads with mustard vinaigrette etc. etc to name but a few. There's also a very good rillette and foie gras in offer.French magazines are readily available - they are mostly recent too!Downstairs lounge area is also available for larger groups with a pool table for those interested. One of my favorite spots in this area - just wish the French owner wouldn't look so serious and perhaps give his customers a smile now and then ;-)"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Fantastic chutneys, great dosa",positive,50,8-Jun-18,"This is an edited review; I had initially given them 4 stars in 2015 with a complaint that the place is too small and the staff too stretched. I went there 3 years later (May 2018), and turns out they've moved to a bigger place!...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",home away from home,negative,30,30-Mar-15,The place serves authentic Indian chaat. The taste was just like what you are served in India. So if you happen to visit Mustafa Shopping centre and want to splurge on Indian food the Kailash Parbat is a good option. The Cholley Bhatura are authentic so is the Chaat.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,what to say of a French Restaurant that fails French Fries,negative,30,12-Oct-14,"I little piece of beef, perfectly cooked served with burned, soft French fries and a good salad for S$44.The piece of beef was probably worth S$20. They are super proud of their homemade French Fries, but looks like no one knows how to make the best of it.No, I am not recommending this restaurant."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good quality Chinese dining,positive,40,05/23/12,The quality of the food was matched by the service.
French,Poulet,French? Really?,negative,30,23-Oct-13,"This new eatery seems to be highly recommended by many friends on my Facebook so I thought will check it out at Great World City. We had the Sautéed mushrooms, french onion soup, roast chicken in champagne (?) sauce, the lamb shank and tiramisu for dessert. None of them were particularly fantastic. Mushrooms were ok, the poach egg added an interesting twist but that's about it. The soup and chicken are too salty for our taste and the white sauce that comes with the chicken taste milky to me - weird. The lamb shank is not bad, very tender and flavorful but Secret Receipts does a similar one. I was really looking forward to the Tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts. Again didn't impress me much, find the sponge a bit too dry but the cream is good! Like some reviewers said they do charge for water which I personally find it ridiculous - even if it's refillable. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon. "

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've Had!,positive,50,14-Jul-14,"Loved Shinji. Came here with the BF during our stay in Singapore and was pleasantly surprised that the price for our experience paid off. We both had the $350 omakase that had variations of dishes and sushi. I eat sushi about 2-3 times a week and am kind of a snob. Most new places I try rarely live up to its hype or feeds me things that I've already experienced. Shinji on the other hand, served a couple of fish i've never tasted before and varying dish preparations that I have not experienced. It was full of firsts and melt in your mouth fish. Will definitely come back when in Singapore. Yoshi, our sushi chef was fabulous! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide range of food,positive,40,17-Jun-17,It was actually my second time eating their buffet and I still enjoyed it!

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Disapointing to say the least,negative,10,14-May-15,"Our visit got off to a bad start when on arrival instead of a warm welcome we were told wait there I will check your booking. Service was poor the food worse. The staff made no attempt to be friendly or welcoming, they performed their work as if we were a necessary evil rather than a valued customer.My wife ordered Rib Eye medium to well, the meat arrived black on the outside cooked past well done, dry and tough. We passed this along to the waiter who in fairness offered to replace it but it took so long to attract the attention of the staff that my wife didn't wish to wait for another. There was no further attention from the staff other than to ask if we wanted more to drink.It was my first visit I certainly won't be visiting again. I prefer not to feel like an intruder. "

Theres no imagination just a lot of really nice raw fish and some small cooked dishes also nice but not superb a grizzly bear does a similar job.For 600$ a head i felt id had a really nice starter. In my opinion it doest compare to Nobu London or even Zuma and certainly not a patch on the food served in the aman resorts I've visited.Service is excellent although you only get wasabi with some dishes."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Authentic Cantonese,negative,30,12/13/13,"There's nothing really special about the Clementi Mall Crystal Jade - crispy roast pork OK, diced pork & snake bean tasty but small serve, watercress soup was tasty but ordinary by Chinese standards, prawn with egg & broccoli a bit bland, the best dish was a silken tofu that you'd think was egg. A la carte price was fair but the set menu prices were exorbitant - much better value ordering a la carte. Service was prompt but disinterested."

However, the quality of food especially in this outlet (Grand Chancellor Hotel) has been on a declining trend ever since! The last we went there was last week - 2 April and after that we have sworn it off our list!For starters we ordered pani puri - which had a stale smell like the oil used to fry it was old. When we pointed it out the staff, his answer was - ""No one else has said that, so you are wrong""Secondly, we ordered food without onions and garlic and sure enough the food arrives with big pieces of onion. Thankfully it was big enough to be visible to the staff as well so he could not say that we are delusional! Without getting into too many details, the staff's attitude despite this mistake was very arrogant. The manager came in after 10 mins of argument with the staff and after being repeatedly asked for. Although his attitude was much better, the damage was done and could not be redeemed. We paid for our hardly eaten food and left immediately.While Kailash Parbat is off our list, I do know quite a few restaurants now that offer much better food minus the attitude. Try Komala Vilas in Race course road for pure veg food or Bikanerwala, Raj or Bombay cafe for better chaat options."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,30-Oct-17,"The standard of the food offering here is exceptional. It is a set menu which ranges across seafood. The meals are prepared in front of you. The wine list is very good. The service is excellent.
There is no better place to eat in Singapore."
French,Paul,Overrated and poor service,negative,20,25-Feb-16,"Was quite disappointed with the service at Paul. The waiters seem To be disorganised and didn't pay attention much to our needs from the moment we had to sit to our order. We ordered salmon salad which was so so an then had to wait almost an hour for our waffle order to appear (was good but maybe because we were so hungry by then). Not sure what happened because we kept asking about it and the waiter checked, then we asked a couple times and he said it is gonna take 5 min more and do we mind waiting (???)"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A unique culinary journey,positive,50,11-Mar-17,Everything was just so perfect .. from the meet and greet all the way to the farewell .. and of course the Japanese cuisine at another level all together .. a unique experience like no other .. guaranteed ..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Make sure this is on your list of places to eat whilst in Singapore! ,positive,50,10-Jan-16,"We visited 'Newton Circus' 3 times whilst in Singapore and each time was amazing All stores are basically the same type of food/dishes and quality, so doesn't matter what stall you order from, you're guaranteed a tasty, cheap meal! $4 per 100g for crab, (make sure you find out the weight of the crab before purchasing, we got a kg crab which was about $40aud) then choose your flavour, we tried the black pepper crab on our first visit and chilli crab on our 2nd, both were amazingly tasty, sweet juicy crab meat! Very messy, but definitely worth it, don't forget to order a portion of fried buns to mop up all the juices! The prawns are also tasty, but again just make sure you find out how much they weigh before ordering, otherwise you could end up with a massive bill (and a lot of wasted food) we had one prawn each, this prawn was as long and wide as my hand when sliced down the centre! Plump and juicy! One was more than enough, the equivalent of maybe 6 Australian king prawns! We also tried blachan stingray, and oh my god, what a flavour explosion! Another must try when in Singapore! Drinks are also cheap, around $2 for a soft drink and about $7 for a beer/cider. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Singapore! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",on of the best japanese a la carte buffet in Singapore,positive,50,22-Sep-18,"I was at Minori couple of times, it just can't be better for the price you are paying ,very huge and fresh selection of japanese food, reasonable prices for drinks and service was friendly and careful even they were so busy, so looking forward to be back when I pop by in Singapore again."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great for crab!,positive,40,7/2/2013,Chili crab was great! One tip would be to go all out and use your hands! Ask for a bib as it can get messy. Also had the beef with chili which was very good too.
French,Paul,Love this restaurant but not in Singapore ,negative,20,15-Oct-16,So this is my second visit a Paul restaurant. The first in paragon. I waited 25 mins for a simple cappuccino and the second here in ngee Ann city. My ears are still sore. Please tell the staff to life the chairs and tables or else put piece of felt on the bottom. It is so sore on my ears. Some of the staff are au fait with what is going on. The rest forget it. The salad was dressed beautifully however. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",old favourite freshened up but didn't dissapoint,positive,50,23-Oct-16,"still stunning array of delicacies to sample and get a good cross section of the best cuisine in the country. well priced, handy vendors who find a seat and a cold beer for you...love the whole thing. satays and chilli crab the best pics."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tender duck!,positive,40,09/13/15,"The waiter couldn't find our reservation and the place was full. They sat 6 of us at a table for 4, and it was a tight squeeze. They promised us the next available table but it never happened.We ordered a number of dishes and a few stood out, among which was the roast duck which was very tender and delicious. The salted egg custard buns were nice, but the bun was very thin and it broke, leaking its contents all over my hand.The roast pork was crispy and lean, but the pieces were unevenly cut, and the portion seemed very small for the price."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Heavenly and fresh,positive,40,31-Aug-12,"I don't know if there is a fish market just behind this restaurant.... but all i can say is. -->>>WOW<<<--. The ingredients were super super super fresh! Did i forget to say super super super? :) I frequent very high end Japanese restaurants all over the world that serve really fresh seafood but this place presents one of the tastiest i have ever tried in my entire life. In terms of creativity.... they are just one step below Iggy's. However, with every bite/spoon i take, it leaves me wanting for more. So much that i had to ask my mom and sister in law for their serving!! Thank God, women eat too little hehe. The dinner was a 10-11 course degustation but it felt like a 5 course one sigh..... that's probably why most reviewers here rate the value 3 to 4 stars only. One of the last dishes served in this place was the A5. For those who have no clue of what it is, its a sirloin steak (actually they serve strips only since its so expensive) that's very very lean but can beat any Wagyu's softness if it had the same proportion or thickness. The interiors are also a step down from Hongkong's L'ATELIER de Joël Robuchon. However, you'll be amazed with the Teppan table. It was spotless! You'll find out how they keep it in mint condition when you go there. For those thinking of bringing a date, i suggest you eat somewhere else. The degustation here is like a tour. When we came here, we had to wait in the ""lobby"" while they were preparing the room. Once we finished with dinner, we were led to another location within the restaurant for dessert and coffee. The moving about wouldn't help if you and your special other were into a very intimate and long conversation. There's just too many interruptions especially with the teppanyaki guy/ sou chef doing his cooking. Overall, i would say this is the place to be when you want to surprise your friends or family who have the budget and have no clue of what's in here. I'd probably be willing to visit this place again if i have the money or not really that hungry. If all else fails, I'm going to McDonald's afterwards haha."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Excellent fish head curry,positive,40,26-Jul-12,Very good food and doesn't hold back on the heat. Service was just so so but the variety and price made up for that. A most enjoyable night.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome food and service!!!,positive,50,10/3/2018,"I was here on July for my uncle’s 60th birthday celebration, and I was really impressed with my dining experience here!Made a reservation via email, and the reservations team was really attentive and helpful to attend to my requests. My Uncle liked yam in general and they gave us really good yam based food recommendations.What’s really awesome was that I had requested for peach (lotus bun) for my Uncle and they really prepared it for him. The decorations for the peach was beautiful - and it’s complimentary :) Service is really great!Food wise, it was really delicious! Some food recommendations that I have here are:- trio meat ( roasted meat, pork belly and duck meat). Really tasty and I could taste the charred flavours of the meat!- crab fried rice was really yummy as well! Fresh and good - their yam based food is really good too!- fish was great as wellOverall, a great experience! "
French,Saveur,Excellent Food for the Price,positive,40,1-Mar-16,"Went for their Valentine's set menu and it was very good. Portions were just right and generous considering the price.Only upsetting bit was actually nothing on the restaurant's part, we were sat next to a very unpleasant group who were being very difficult customers with a whole slew of 'custom orders' that kept changing. But kudos to the staff for handling them with poise and patience! (:"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Wow wow wow,positive,50,20-Mar-18," Not sure where to start. We had an amazing experience at Shinji by Kanesaka. The food is absolutely amazing, the private rooms with your own chef makes this an culinary feast. The sushi and sashimi is made to perfection. A perfect place to any special occasion."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",There are better places to eat than at Newton,negative,30,27-Jan-12,Newton Hawker center is centrally located with many stalls. Many of the food sold are not that bad but not excellent either. Because tourist do not know of other places to eat - they tend to go to Newton to eat - and pay very high price for the food. In Singapore there are a lot of places to eat - including those food courts in shopping malls and coffee shops. Tourist - I urge you to ask any people in the streets or at your hotel where ELSE you can go to have some local food... and you should be able to find one within 1 to 2 km....
French,Saveur,2nd visit!,positive,50,28-Nov-17,"Service was so much better off than the time I come. Most importantly, the staff are attentive and more willing to serve you. :D Food standard is excellent, will still prefer the outlet at Purvis Street."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food - Service,positive,40,4/11/2013,Good restautrant and great variety of Seafood including Fish through to Alaskian King Crab..Reasonable price as wellFound sitting inside a little noisey so would suggest you sit outside if you want volume at a normal level.If you want the Private rooms make sure you boook in advance as we missed out
French,Saveur,Excellent Service,positive,50,3-Nov-17,"The staff were extremely on point, they ensure to clear your plates the moment you’re done so you’ll have a proper clean place to chill with diners."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Clean and decent,positive,40,2-Nov-17,I like the concept of the restaurant where you are served the food ordered through a tablet. Its a better buffet in that sense.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Exclusive Vegetarian Restaurant,positive,40,11-Jun-18,"Had South Indian Meals on a Sunday..Fairly crowded Restaurant with adequate seating arrangements..Service was quick..Thali had all the items in adequate quantity..being from South India, I felt Rice was not upto standards in taste...also had a plate of Plantain Bajji which was hot & tasty."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Improved!,positive,40,4-Feb-14,"I used to go to Newton Circus when it was a hawker centre in the middle of a roundabout. It was great! Then they moved it to the 'sanitized' permanent location it is in now and I felt it was a tourist trap of the worst possible type. I had avoided it for years and the then took someone who was in Singapor efor the first time there so they could see it...it was all I feared. But this visit was different - greatly improved - local folk as well as tourists (always a good sign). The food was excellent, touts trying to get you into their particular stalls wer enot too agressive so walk round at leats once and dont forget there is an 'outside row' as well"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent quality for a buffet. Good service though!,positive,40,30-May-18,"The ordering app worked great today, our orders arrived quick and accurately. Was apprehensive about the service based on reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. New staff Jay was especially helpful polite and friendly. You could see they try hard with English. What would have been nice was if tea was included in the price, instead of $1.90/pax"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only for the Sashimi,negative,30,22-Jul-17,Originally intended to use the entertainer app during dinner hours but soon realised that the menu they offered are geared more for buffet. The Ala carte serving was too little to justify the app. Buffet was so so. Bland for most. Here for the sashimi.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an amazing city for food,positive,40,26-Jun-13,"every stall got a tasty favours that make us go again and again. the only problem is that they don't have tissues for the customers.
thanks alot for the very nice food."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak Frites Supper,negative,30,23-Mar-15,"Nice location on Duxton Hill. This restaurant only serves Steak Frites for the main course and there is a choice of 2 sizes. The steak and chips were average, the salad was excellent as were the starters."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Breakfast at Changi City Point outlet,negative,30,05/18/15,Food was served quite fast. Whole restaurant is not that big and currently there is 10% discount for NTUC member for weekend. I would not say that the food is that fantastic. Those fried items were very oily and fried carrot cake is the best. One of the unique item is the squid ink dumpling which is worth trying.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",SUPER,positive,50,13-Apr-12,"excellent sushi. I was amazed for sushi to be so good. but in my humble opinion, the price is way too high. almost $400 with plum wines. but then again, the wines are really really good! If you are going to stay at Raffles Hotel, this is the BEST OF BEST OF BEST SUSHI in singapore. 5-star!"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Very good indian food.,positive,40,6-Sep-15,Good Indian (Punjabi) food and have both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Beautiful location and specifically in night looks very good.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Vignette of history!,positive,40,12/29/14,"Good to be back after many years and see things are still mostly the same. The dim sum still being carted along the aisles which has disappeared from so many restaurants in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hongkong as was commonplace before. The quality is good to very good.I especially enjoyed the chicken wings in paper bag, steamed sticky riceParcels, and the hargao dumplings. Good, fast service and very reasonable."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Must try more than once,positive,40,05/13/12,For great Chinese food in Singapore must dine at Crystal Jade. This brand has many categories and please be sure of what you would like to eat and then choose an outlet accordingly. For me its always been a trial and error. There are certain outlets which have excellent Dim sums and yet some dont have iot on their menu.food is consistently good and the safest restaurant to go to for chinese cuisine. I would not pick on any one dish because everything on their menu is good
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch,positive,40,10/3/2017,"Irish fattened ducks are roasted on site , hence fresh and moist.sweetened Roast pork also features. Rice or noodles and fried vegetables are good too. Prices are reasonable."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Delicious French Bistro fare,positive,50,12-Jun-17,Whatever L'Entrecote puts into their steak sauce it makes a to-die-for sauce! Simply the best steak & frites & secret sauce in Singapore. Topped off with a fabulous caramel sauce pudding in the style of a fondant au chocolat. Such a treat.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Friend gathering,positive,50,8/6/2016,Actually I'm a guest at the hotel. I visited peach blossom with my friend. Christine and Terry recommended us smoke duck and chili crab. Never ate in Hong Kong before. It was delicious. Very appreciate Christine and Terry for the recommentation and the great service and ambience night. Highly recommended. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food,positive,40,12-Jan-18,"We where there with 5 people enjoying food from different stalls. It's a Asian style environment but still focused on foreign tourist.
The food was super"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,positive,50,11/19/13,"Had a recommendation from a friend from Singapore that when in Singapore we should all go to Long Beach Restaurant at Dempsey. Well we did and as there was 6 of us we all fought it all to get as much of the Black Pepper Crab as we could. yea it was GOOD. Very Peppery but isn't that how it was meant to be. Great Service, cold drinks, good food, and restaurant was packed (which always tells you something) What more could you ask for."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore","Banana leaf goodies, i like",positive,40,2-Apr-09,"Banana leaf goodies, i like"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide food varieties,negative,30,17-Oct-16,"There ain't many Japanese buffet in Singapore and Minori spread considered good. However, as many have commented, indeed their service isn't prompt for it took us to signal a few times before we got attended to. Just 1 incident to highlight - they need to double check to ensure that the ipad is securely fasten. Mine dropped midway through my meal and caused a mess. But they were fast in this aspect of cleaning. It would have improved our dining experience if they would to relocate us to a clean table instead."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Delicious Food, Attentive and Personalised Service",positive,50,4-Apr-16,"If you are looking for a more unique, personalised fine dining experience - this would be it (at a great financial cost).The food was delicious and cannot be faulted by any account. The waitstaff and chef asked if we had any dietary requirements and would tailor the menu accordingly if we did have any. We didn't and was blessed to experience the wide variety of fresh seafood that this restaurant featured. For me, the most outstanding dish was their signature marinated Botan shrimp with Sea urchin and Oscietra caviar (don't have a separate picture unfortunately) and for my partner, the lobster (see picture below) was a standout. We both agreed that the Wagyu was the best that we've tasted (picture also below).My expectation was that there would only be one chef's table that seated 10 - 12 people, but they actually have 4 rooms, each with their (teppanyaki-style) grill. Although that did not impact the excellent service in any way, I didn't expect there to be multiple chefs serving multiple tables. Perhaps if you are considering going here, go with friends or family that fill up one room (our room would seat 6 people) so service and your experience is seamless, i.e. not impacted by your neighbouring diners.For me, this restaurant is a once in a lifetime experience as it is very expensive, and in Singapore there's also a 10% service charge and a 7% tax on top of the bill. I would consider it one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and would cost at least approximately SGP$500 per person. If you add drinks, it can easily be more than that.Price aside, the food, service and restaurant is definitely 10/10, I highly recommend you try it if you are considering it!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",a rarely 4.5 star for a japanese restaurant in Sg,positive,40,21-Mar-15,"it is extremely close to a full marks minus some of its logistic timing arrangement (fixed 8pm or 530pm dinner timing w totally no lunch timing) and limited window view , as well as some limited choices of wine/sake (some options only have a whole bottle rather than in per glass charging)Its standard is well-maintained from service to pleasant-looking & attentive staff (well diverse of races). Not to mention its standards in Culinary: primarily focused on most japanese-imported stuff with fusion. Freshness, Fine dining...They could be even more daring in their attempt, i felt safe but i would love to see some risks...All of us love the tenderness of its bread (little things score!) , and then its caviar, boston lobster, sea urchin, the honeydew is fibrous w natural sweetness...(two types of beef : Ohmi beef and sorry i forgot the other one)The abalone from aust didnt really fare on the highest range of scores...We can ask for another round of bread or cold dish too, however it is just too filling, though the meal is served only in degustation form(Side point: Luv their signage of their lavatories )Do NOT step in if you do not have S$500 per pax....is that why the server is shocked that i m a Singaporean (yet not a paid food critic)?"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),School Holiday - Marvellous,positive,50,03/18/17,"Every school holiday visited Singapore, definitely went back to Peach Blossoms for the dim sum buffet, the service staff informed the Maybank promotion is on going at $88 nett for 2 persons. Need to special mentioned the dishes, Cheese Lobster, Buddha jump over the wall......really enjoyed!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A most pleasant experience of food and service at Peach Blossom,positive,50,10/23/16,"We made the right choice to celebrate my brother's birthday at Peach Blossom (Marina Mandaring)! Service was excellent and food was delicious. We enjoyed every dish especially the silver cod in rice wine. I must commend the attentive service extended by Terry, Jeff and Christine. We were pleasantly surprised when the birthday cake was brought out on a well decorated big plate with the birthday greetings for my brother beautifully handwritten in calligraphy on the plate itself. Thanks, Terry for doing this and Christine for the cheerful delivery of the birthday greetings in high spirits. The outstanding service has made this birthday celebration a memorable one for the family. We will definitely return for another happy occasion."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Ok,negative,30,9-Aug-17,Ordered medium well steak but it came well done - too charred and tough. Complimentary drink was good.
French,Saveur,Won't be Back,negative,10,4-Sep-17,"Am not sure whether you have disabled the review function on your page, here's my share of my experience at your Cathay branch:Made an appointment via Chope on Friday at 12noon. Sat on the seats right outside the place, staff walked around, saw us, took their time and didn't open up the place till almost 12.10pm.Ate few times previously at the Far East outlet (FE) and was really impressed with the food. So we ordered 2 x Signature Pasta, 2 x Duck Confit with add-on soup & drink for one of the Duck Confit. Checked with one of the tall built with pony tail waitress whether I can use my Chope voucher, and was advice to show it to the cashier during payment.Signature Pasta came in a jiffy, my kids loved it, soup came shortly, but it was mildly warm, I expected something slightly hotter, since I was the first table there and food should be freshly prepared ?? Thereafter, it took very long for the duck confit to be served, but based on my experience at the FE outlet, good things are worth waiting for. To my horror, when the dish arrived at our table, it was a far cry from what I've had in FE, to begin with, the food wasn't even luke warm! The duck wasn't like what I have tasted, the skin wasn't crispy and the meat was like something that was grilled earlier and quickly heated up prior to serving, the temperature of the dish really spoilt the entire dish. I can't believe I've waited so long to be served with food prepared insincerely.To make things worst, when I made payment, was told that Chope vouchers cannot be redeemed during PH, I admit that it may be my fault to have overlooked the fine prints when I bought the voucher, but why didn't the waitress highlight to me when I was placing my orders! Totally changed my perspective of Saveur, all the best to the management!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre food and service,negative,20,16-Jun-18,"Went to their Katong Square restaurant on 15th June in the evening for their ala carte buffet. Food was of low quality, especially the sushi dishes. The yakitori items are either too salty or oily and the soup dishes are rather bland. Only the sashimi are worth trying as they tasted rather fresh. Some of the items we ordered were not served and we had to remind and chase the staff for those dishes to be served, even though the restaurant was not overly croweded .Service wise, most of the service staff were relatively polite and prompt in clearing the dishes . The only exception was the male manager of the restuarant, with a heavy malaysian accent and spoke maninly in chinese, was really rude and loud. When we had problem using the ipad gadget during ordering , the manager was standing nearby and thus we gestured to him for help . We were shocked when he walked towards us and raised his voice and asked us rudely in these exact words in chinese ""????“ . He even stared at us as if we did something wrong. We were so taken aback by his rudeness that we were speechless for a while before we continued to ask him how to use the ipad. He did not utter a word and just pressed a few buttons on the ipad and walked off thereafter, leaving us wondering if our order was being placed. Never did we expect to receive such rude and bad service from the restaurant manager. Enough said, the full price (without any promotional discount) that we paid for such mediocre food and service was definitely not worthwhile and this will be our first and last visit."
French,Saveur,Affordable Price,negative,30,4-Jun-17,Affordable price and acceptable food. Staffs are too busy handling the crowds pretty hard to get the attnetion of the staffs.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value good quality,positive,50,22-Feb-17,"Good value for its ala-carte Jap buffet.
Sashimi cuts were thick and juicy. One of the few that offer temajiki (swordfish) sashimi.
Good service too."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointed at the Suntec Mall l'entrecote... No return visit planned,negative,20,31-Aug-15,"I visited Duxton hill in 2012, was ok... So decided to try out their new opening in Suntec mall. My for end booked on line as you can do for the Suntec Mall one. That was the only decent thing that went well.On arrival, took time to find our table, they only sold Stella beer... No other beer, they had run out of gin ( I don't like Stella, but I'm ok to drink other stuff). Tasted the red wine on house... It was dry and tasted of vinegar, went for the 99$ red ( was meant to be a treat ) ... Turned it just drinkable. My starter of snails was good... My for ends starter of duck roulette was fat with a bit of duck taste ... It should have had more duck taste. The steak was fine but the sauce was over bearing.. Almost drowned it. It just felt a poor experience. Oh - amd if you have a nut allergy, stay away. We asked if one salad could be without walnuts... They brought it with, then took it away, my fore d discovered on eating it all they had done was pick the walnuts off as he found 2 at the bottom of his sale dish. Good thing he just hates walnuts and it's not a life threatening problem. All 3 of us at this restaurant were really disappointed... By food, service, amd ambience. Telling us the reason the food is slow as there is a baby fare upstairs in the mall did not impress us either..... We could not see any connection. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Great flavours.,positive,40,2-Jul-14,Very good meal and good prices. Rate the fish head curry as better then Sammy's at Dempsey hill. Plenty of room and good service.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Celebration,positive,50,03/17/17,"Went down for a ala-carte dimsum lunch buffet. Atmosphere was relatively tranquil with a strong historical chinese vibe throughout the restaurant which complements well with the food. Service was super prompt and staffs are relatively friendly and nice!!!! Special thanks to staff Jeff, Sook Teng, Douglas and Noel for serving our table!! The staffs are well trained, relatively patient, prompt in serving; refilling and attending to our needs!! :-) restaurant is strongly recommended for family gatherings! "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Lots of selection, but service fell short",negative,30,3/10/2017,"Plenty to choose from, what we did have was very nice. Service was very slow with staff opting to serve Asian customers and friends / family of the kitchen staff first. We ordered 12 spring rolls, a vegetable dish & 2 mains, we questioned if that would be enough for two and advised would be more than enough. We aren't big eaters and found we were still hungry when we left. Dishes were a lot smaller and more expensive than all the other restaurants we ate at this week. Had to ask twice for the bill which was strange as they didn't look busy with only 1/3 of tables occupied. Bit of a shame as had read good reviews about this place, the hotel was first class on the other hand. "
French,Paul,It's alright for a start.,positive,40,21-Jul-16,"Visited with my Dad for for lunch. They had a Bastille Day promotion on; it was a four-course menu which we absolutely loved. Escargots on toast, roasted cod, asparagus soup, I wish it were on every day. Food is Halal as far as I know it, just that they don't have certification (yet, I heard) as they serve alcohol. To get a four-course meal for the price it was at was a nice deal. Main course portion was too small for me though. Guess it's a norm, but because it's delicious, you'll still find yourself too stuffed for dessert.  Some of the staff could do better in terms of service though, it doesn't hurt to smile, guys!Overall, a wonderful experience and I hope to visit again soon."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch at Peach Blossoms - Marina Mandarin Singapore,positive,50,03/18/17,Very nice food with very courtesy staffs. They are Bowie and Alicia. Will back back more often. Member of life and style and entitled to 25% discount and can used given cash vouchers.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent food but no special orders entertained,positive,40,19-Apr-18,"Tucked away at a really quiet mall (UE Square), lies this Japanese ala Carte buffet restaurant (it basically means that they prepare and serve whatever you order through the ipad). One annoying thing is that the app crashes from time to time and then we’d have to let in the orders again.The quality of food overall was great, and if you go during lunch and get the 1 for 1 (we went for dinner), this would be really great value for money! The staff were very conscientious in clearing the plates of food that we have finished eating.The main irritation was not we could not made any special orders - the feature on the ipad app does not work and the staff were insistent we could not modify any dish (basically we wanted the torches salmon aburi without the rice). Another surprising feature was that we were charged for drinks! Hot or cold green tea is usually included when we pay $40++ for a buffet..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,positive,50,21-Jul-14,we just love the assortment of food offered here. great place for dinner hang out after a day's walking tours

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fabulous sashimi/ sushi (at a price),positive,40,28-Nov-17,A great experience if you are a fan of sashimi/ sushi (including cuttlefish sperm & monk fish liver!). Undeniably fabulous sashimi and sushi; also undeniably expensive. We went on a Monday evening when there were not many diners and the sushi bar was lacking in atmosphere. 
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Very Tasty- Worth the Money,positive,40,8-Mar-16,"Ananda Bhavan, the name inspired us to enter as we were eagerly looking for a good Veggie restaurant at Singapore.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,very good athmosphere,positive,50,23-May-15,"located in a vibrant part of china town
packed on weekends, make a reservation.
typical french food, starters like patee or onion soup, main course only entrecote with fries and salad, excellent !!!!
nice deserts, wine etc.....
great experience, reasonable price"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average only but authentic +,negative,30,1/11/2012,I can only compare this to the yum cha back home in Melbourne.I found this place upstairs in a street off Temple St in middle of Chinatown. Poorly signposted and had to ask local shopkeeper for directions.Came for lunch on weekday and there was a photo description menu rather than wheeled trollies which made it easy to order but less interesting.The yum cha was standard rather than inspiring. Tasty+ Would like to try Yum Cha elsewhere in Singapore before rushing back.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Zul,positive,50,12-Apr-15,"Good deal for cocktails ,mocktails and premium wines. Cheerful staff and kind management will fulfill your dinning expectations. Great place to have authentic Indian food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,If you love duck,positive,40,04/29/16,"Great duck place. Their roasted duck is succulent and tender. Don't forget the char siew (BBQ pork with honey sauce). A little charred on the outside, yet soft and tender inside. It is a simple place for Hong Kong style noodles and porridge."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good place to eat idly-dosa in Singapore,positive,40,12-Jul-13,"Murugan's is a good place to eat before, in between or after a shopping spree at Musthafa's mall in Singapore. A smallish restaurant but with neat, homely ambience, their idly, dosa, coffee breakfast is excellent. One also gets excellent vada, pongal etc at Murugan's."
French,Angelina_MBS,Delightful bistro coffee shop in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall Singapore,positive,40,13-Mar-18,Angelina is a small intimate and very high quality coffee and pastries cafe in Marina Bay Sands shopping mall Singapore. The bistro cafe is raised above an indoor water feature and has comfortable seating and a high class feel. Very tasty macaroons and cappuccino. Service was slow even though it was not busy. However I was in no rush and really enjoyed this cafe coffee shop.
French,L_Angelus,Thank god for this little gem,positive,40,10-Nov-15,"It used to bother me that L'angelus hardly ever updated their menu; however, over the years I've come to appreciate that sometimes you just want a perfect elegant little bistro like L'Angelus that hardly ever changes. The foie gras is perfect, the confit of duck delicious and the wine list is very accessible. My only complaint is that the fries that come with the confit are a little soggy. Nevertheless, when I want classic relaxing French in a sophisticated setting, this place is always on my short list. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty and tender,positive,40,04/22/17,"Had dinner at the vivocity outlet. The duck with salted vegetable soup could have been subtler. Not that it wasn't tasty, but could have held back in the salt a little. Duck noodles was good- tender, succulent duck slices with springy noodles and blanched veges. Service was also not bad given that they were extremely busy during dinner time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",RE: don't think healthy food,negative,30,9-Aug-12,an assortment of local foods... watch out for the prices... ask for the price before purchasing...the place gets crowded in the night but the food is not that great...
French,Saveur,Non-existent Service,negative,10,2-Oct-17,"We went to the Cathay branch of Saveur. Glasses of water were not served, appetizers came AFTER main courses, horribly difficult to get waiter attention. Food was average, but for 50 dollars I can definitely get a much better meal elsewhere. All in all, terrible service and food that isn't worth the price. I wonder what we even pay the service charge for. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Pure Veg North Indian Food In Singapore,positive,40,30-Jan-17,"The food is very good, we tried the chaats, starters and mains, couldn't fault any of them. Service is quick as well. A little bit pricy, however you get your monies worth. Overall you can't wrong with kailash Parbat. Only complain is the long waiting times on Saturdays and Sunday...it is very popular in Singapore!!!"

Have the Singapore chili crab - great sauce, remember to order the steam and fried bread to scoop up the gravy !! Black pepper crab - crab so fresh n well cooked. Try the cereal prawns - one of the best with so fine cereal crumbs n tasty fresh prawns. The service was prompt and efficient too. We will be back !"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit of a tourist trap,negative,30,23-Jul-16,"At first glance, it's a nice place to get a variety of local fares in one location, with nice open air seating. But it's a bit of a tourist trap, with some of the food being too expensive for local standards. I do have some friends who come from overseas and hear from word of mouth to come here, but for the same variety of food, I'd prob take them somewhere else to get cheaper food, such as Chomp Chomp or even East Coast. But if you do choose to eat there, some of the local delicacies to order include: BBQ Sambal Stingray, BBQ Chicken Wings, Hokkien Mee, Carrot Cake and sugarcane to wash it down."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Sadly No Tandoor of the buffet :,negative,20,14-May-12,"Cheap as chips, we (3 pax) Singapore Dollars S$ 66.00 went for the buffet but then it was ALL vegetarian except for a goat mutton curry.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food all day,positive,40,28-May-12,"Only a few stalls are open in the morning, but enough variety."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Best Avoided,negative,10,21-Mar-13,The service was really bad... the food quality was not at all good... with rush during the morning breakfast many things goes out of stock and the replenishment is done in leisure. Heating arrangement of the buffet was bad.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese restaurant,negative,30,17-Dec-17,reasonable pricing but space to small for good dining experience. Staff are friendly but they spoke mandarin which not everyone is able to communicate. Although the ordering process is good and high tech but the older customers will find it a challenge trying to use the pad for ordering their dishes. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Reunion Dinner,positive,50,01/31/17,The meal was well prepared. Food was great. Service was great. Very nice personalized service with attentive staff.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always a pleasure ,positive,50,02/18/17,"Every time I'm in Singapore ,we go out with business friends to LB food is excellent ,pepper crab and lots of other choices. We always sit outside and enjoy the warm evening air ,especially for us Germans in our wintertime ;)This time I forgot my bag at the restaurant and only realized it when I was back my hotel. We have called the management and the manager Priscilla was so kind to grab the bag and stored it until I came for pickup.Awesome !... Tx so much !"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nice French food,positive,40,15-Jan-18,"A pleasant restaurant in a nice spot, with an outside terrace, and a view.Good service and a nice menu mainly with meat cuts.We had first a good terrine, and then a grilled sirloin, with french fries of course!Great meat, juicy and cooked to our liking.A decent wines list with a good rosé wine too, ideal in this hot weather.Ready to good back as soon as i am tired of the local delicacies.Bravo."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Chaat and North Indian veg food,positive,50,9-Jan-14,"Have been to this restaurant quite a lot of times and their food is tasty and up to the mark. Not to be missed are the Chaat platter, samosas and chola bhaturas. Great ambiance and great food!!!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Freshness at its best,positive,50,19-Mar-17,My family's favourite choice when it comes to Japenese buffet. The free flow of fresh shashimi is a constant draw.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",First class!,positive,50,31-Jul-16,"Dinner for 4 with Japanese guests in a private room. Set menu. Great variety, every course fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Even the cold sake was outstanding.
Excellent service throughout. My guests and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Very expensive, but worth it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An Experience (Good),positive,40,31-May-12,We found out it is a night center so there was a few hawkers open for a late lunch. The Indian food was very tasting. Visited with the guys working the stand and a random old guy that saw we were tourists. Fun experience and some good food. I was warned later to only purchase food that the price is clearly marked. Some Hawkers were price gouging people. 
French,L_Angelus,Happy Experience,positive,50,14-Apr-17,"Stopped by late one evening without a reservation and, to our surprise, was given a table and served great food. We both had the set dinner in this classic French restaurant. The onion soup was just right - a bit of cheese and crouton in a very nice and very-full-of-onions broth. The tuna tataki with sesame was perfectly done and my wife's cassoulet was just delicious with enough to take some home with us. They offer a wide selection of wines and the wait staff understand how to recommend them. The creme brûlée was perfect as was the service through the meal. It's a bit pricy but that's common for Singapore. If you like classic French food we'd highly recommend L'ANGELUS."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good won tons,negative,30,12/31/15,"This is average when compared to a Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. You might find the comparison unreasonable since this is Singapore but there are many good dim sum venues in Singapore. We had prawn rice rolls and also pork rice rolls which were good but came in a strange soy that I've never had before and I've eaten a lot of rice rolls - trust me. The won ton noodle soup is good however for a won ton. We also had dumplings in spicy sauce which tasted average at best. The service is good, however when we were there the place was practically empty so it was to be expected. The restaurant itself is fairly standard looking so not sure it would be ideal for celebrations but it is fine for dim sum if you are in that area. Would I go again?? Probably not.. Would I recommend.. Yes if in the area and had to eat dim sum or was staying in the hotel and didn't fancy taking a walk outside."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but delicious,positive,40,8/9/2017,The pork ribs are phenomenal! The food is generally nice but a bit on the pricey side. Try to get seating indoors as it can get rather hot and humid outside
French,Saveur,Good place with good food,positive,50,7-Nov-16,"Food was great, service staff very friendly. Reasonable price. The outlet was easy to find. Ambience was nice."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent ..maybe the best Sushi place in Singapore ? Comes at a price ..,positive,40,23-Nov-14,"This is a very classic Japanese Sushi restaurant located in the beautiful Raffles Hotel complex , so to really Max out your credit card on style , indulge yourself after dinner with cool drinks ( Singapore Slings ) at the Rafles Hotel Bar as well !I am fanatic about my Sushi Rice and Shinji probably has the closest to the top quality rice you can get from the superstar Tokyo sushi chefs..The quality of the meal was outstanding.Just read that a 3 stars Sushi Chef in London is now charging 300 GBP per Omasake , so I suppose the prices her are after all good value !"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Better than expected! ,positive,50,09/27/18,"Fast service for a weekday lunch. Ambience is lovely though tables are spaced rather close together. Food was excellent. Everything we had was fantastic.
Recommend the salted egg prawns. And eggplant!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Beware of touting, do not settle for the 1st stall owner who approaches you",positive,40,17-Sep-13,"I'm staying at Singapore and hardly dine at Newton Food Center since it's notorious for overcharging. However, the coach that I took returning from Malaysia stopped at Newton, I decided to settle for a quick dinner. The last time I came here was years ago...My 1st impression was touting is so rampant here, something that is so rare in Singapore.My advice for visitors, especially tourist from overseas, DO NOT settle for the 1st stall owner who manage to find you a seat. You are absolutely free to sit anywhere and order from any stall.I also realise that those who were touting are all the seafood stalls holder. From my observation over an hour there, many tourist actually ordered only seafood from the stall holder who found them a vacant table and gave many other nice food a miss since they didn't even walk around the food center.Please walk around and choose other food as well besides seafood, which is way overcharged at Newton Food Center and does not really taste good."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch at peach blossoms,positive,50,05/16/15,"This is an excellent place to eat lovely ambience, great food and exceptional service staff must mention Nobel who is gem among service staff.

French,L_Angelus,"Shoosh, don't let the word get out.",positive,50,16-Aug-11,"L'Angelus is a romantic French restaurant tucked away in Chinatown. It has a real Parisian flair with classic French dishes. Food is amazing, it almost makes me want to move to Singapore.Last time I was here we had pan-fried foie gras, goats cheese salad and escargot for entree and confit duck for main. The escargot was amazing but I wish I hadn't eaten on the plane as I would have loved to have the steak tartare also. Good wine selection also.L'Angelus is a place to go and enjoy with good friends or someone special."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Taste but poor hospitality.,negative,30,3-Sep-15,"Restaurant has nice a ambience and a good food quality & taste.Avoid going at closing hours ,doing so who will be treated as you went there to eat for free.I belong to the same industry and its morally wrong to serve guest forcefully only because its a closing time."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service,negative,20,5-Jul-17,"Waited very long for food to be served. Slow service the moment it got crowded.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper & chilli crab,positive,40,08/18/13,"The crab was extremely fresh, cooked to perfection with tasty sauce.
Tip: Be sure to ask for the weight of the crab before you order, as the price is market price set for that day. Otherwise it could become expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Food ok , and not as cheap as you would expect",negative,30,5-Sep-14,"The food is ok and more expensive that you would think, due to the vicinity and the amounts of tourist. However the experience is still worthwhile if you enjoy experiencing something different. A different style of life in a different culture. I enjoy the outside environment and the smells floating around the air. However, if you don't like to sweat and eat at the same time then this is not for you."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very crowded place and food was so-so,negative,30,3/9/2018,"Was brought here by a local friend who swears by the Alaskan crab here. The Alaskan crab was good (though very expensive) but the rest of the dishes were a complete let-down. Food in Malaysia is better (and cheaper!!). Sprawling place with lots of rooms around and it just had a strange atmosphere. It was very crowded but it just felt a bit claustrophobic rather than lively, and service was very hit and miss. If you're stuck in one of the rooms at the back (which we were), then you sometimes had to go out to get the waitstaff to refill your tea as they don't come by other than to serve your food. I wouldn't recommend it. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Simply Awesome,positive,40,28-Jan-16,"We visited Ananda Bhavan after our shopping at around 10pm.

Asked for little cream but it still looks a lot. No Long spoon provided and when I signalled for one, they came with the bill!! They claim it is not normal to include a Long spoon for cold chocolate but then there is no such thing on the menu. Only saw hot chocolate on the menu. But sometimes really really one should use common sense which sadly isn't so common nowadays.I've not had the cold chocolate drink in Paris because the line is usually impossible. So I can't compare.But they are famous for this in Paris and this just doesn't taste 'famous'.They have set breakfasts, brunch, sandwiches, salads, soups, main courses, cheeses, pastries, desserts, macarons, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, Viennese pastries, fruit juices, Soft drinks, beets, champagne, wines and spirits.Just be prepared to pay Angelina prices.There is also a tea time set menu from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for S$49++."

French,Angelina_MBS,"It's not Mont Blanc, it's Flore",positive,40,16-Aug-16,"This review is for a visit I did some time back in Dec 2015. Went there with a group of friends for lunch.Obviously we didn't go to Angelina especially for lunch. We were after the Old Fashioned Hot Chocolate L'Africain. Before Angelina Singapore, we need to go to Paris to taste this cup of heavenly chocolate but now it's available near us!I personally enjoy the thick hot chocolate, served with the chantily cream. It's still heavenly, though a friend of us complained a bit that the Singapore version is not as good as what she remembered from Paris.Tried the Pan-fried Scallops on black venere rice with shellfish cream. Scallops were nicely cooked, but I find the whole dish to be too much on the salty side.I almost gave Angelina the average 3 stars rating, but for one thing, I decided to give it 4 stars. It's for the flore. The bright red dessert --- combination of raspberry, meringue, white chocolate, and vanilla mousse --- is one of the best I ever tasted. It is a truly a beautiful dessert. Maybe this is my personal take. Angelina's signature for me is not the overly-sweet Mont Blanc, but the beautiful Flore. I hope they will never take it off the menu, ever."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore", Catch up session with friends,positive,50,4-May-17,It's definitely a great place to dine in with friends or family. Unexpectedly fresh sashimi served. Love the perfect grilled yakitori especially the garlic pork skewer and shiitake mushroom! Tempura were fried just perfect and dip together with the sauce. Highly recommend to other people for celebrating occasions like birthday or family and friends gathering. For sure I'll visit Shin Minori Restaurant again!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and should be,negative,30,24-Oct-16,"This is a cheap eat, and it should be. The quality ordinary. The shellfish I had and on previous occasions looks great but lacks flavour, I suspect all farmed and I don't dare ask where (or how). I enjoy watching the life at this place and how the stall owners work. A different view of the world."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great but needs to improve,positive,40,3-May-17,"It's perfect for every occasion from birthday celebrations, farewells to festivities, or no special day actually but you just need a good food at a great price! Lovely place for yakitori & sashimi especially. Needs to work on their ordering&serving though. Ive patronised them at least once every two months and their ordering system either hangs or the order was submitted but kitchen didnt receive it. Also, once the order is sent, it doesnt get recorded on the list, so no way to track your orders. Just 2 days ago, we ended up waiting 20mins for an order which we eventually got them to check with the kitchen but they insisted there werent any orders left for the table - and we had no way to prove. I'll bring a pen and paper next time to track my orders, but I'll return for sure. "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Service is SHOCKING,negative,20,23-Jan-15,"So having been ti the Duxton Hill restaurant and throughly enjoyed it we thought we would try the Suntec City outlet. OMG what a shocker. It was a Friday evening and we had made reservations for 18:30. The restaurant was pretty much empty at that time so we were shown to our table and ordered sparkling water at S$9++ per bottle. OK no worries. We then ordered a bottle of house red which came as a non descript wine that just said L'entrecote 2013 Bordeaux. No other information. We asked the waitress for more information about the wine...needless to say...CLUELESS!Anyway..main course. We ordered the large Steak Frites (S$39.90++). I ordered medium and my wife ordered well done. We were served the complimentary walnut salad with consisted of a plate of greens with 3 half walnuts on the side. When the main course arrived I was aghast to see my wife's steak was actually medium rare and mine was rare. We immediately called over the waiter and explained that the steak was not cooked as per our order. When we told him we ordered well done and medium he suggested we had ordered the wrong thing and that for medium we should have ordered well done and for well done we should have ordered extra well done. I was shocked. I laughed at his suggestion and told him we we're not eating this and that he should take it away and we want it cooking as we originally ordered...he took it away and 10 minutes later he returned with the exact sam plates and the steak had clearly been placed in a microwave oven, the steak was incredibly tough at this point. We spoke to the waiter once again and told him we were not happy with the meal. He then said he would ask the manager to come and speak with us....LOL!...The manager arrived...some young french girl who had clearly never even managed a greasy spoon cafe let alone managed a restaurant! She asked what was the problem and we explained the whole sorry saga again. She asked did we want a replacement to which we replied ""yes"". 23 minutes later we had a replacement meal. Mine was ok, however my wife was still cooked medium. At this point we thought f k it. We ate what we could and decided to pay and leave. At the checkout the manager (Estelle) gave us our bill (S$158) and never once asked us was every thing ok. I mentioned this to her and she said she didn't ask because her view was if we didn't complain again then everything must have been ok. Her arrogance was beyond belief. Even though the Duxton Hill experience was great, we will never go to either again because of the terrible service at Suntec City.BE AWARE!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TERRIBLE ARROGANT SERVICE"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Part of the world's 50 best restaurants? Something is wrong here!,negative,30,12-Jun-15,"$400 each degustation dinner plus 10% service + 7% tax; now add $20 for a bottle of water ++ and $22 for a cocktail ++... so, dinner for two including two bottles of water and one cocktail $1100!!! Which we would have paid without pain if we would have had an amazing unforgettable meal as we expected but sadly this was not the case. Out of the 10 courses we only enjoyed the Shrimp with Sea Urchin topped with Caviar and the two slices of Kobe. We are aware that a degustation menu means small portions but honestly these people take this too seriously, our Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass-fed Beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi Mustard was ridiculously tiny!! I could even count the rocket leaves put in the plate as garnish. I won't make this review too long but the last savory dish Consommé with Rice and Snapper deserve a mention. I hardly found the fish and the consommé was so light and clear that with all due respect I have had better consommés at the hospital, sorry for the honesty. Same to say about the dessert. Melon? and a chocolate mousse? That was pretty ordinary for such an extravagant price! So disappointed after such a wonderful experience at Tetsuya in Sydney. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Busy Restaurant famed for its seafood - Staff stressed!,negative,30,04/25/18,I ate here with a colleague as was told it was the best pepper Crab in Singapore. the restaurant is very busy and staff looked stressed. We had booked a table but still had to stand in a queue to get a table. No eye contact from the receptionist and staff were mostly unhelpful. they need to work on customer service. The Pepper Crab was good but not up to House of Crab in Colombo.

Most of the family members were first time customers and were pleasantly surprise with the layouts and setting . The restaurant gave us a sizable and good partition for our 3 tables which was also very cozy. The serving staff (especially Ms Nobel, Bowie and Vivian) were very friendly and attentive, The manage, Mr Gan, kept popping by to ensure all things ok. The food was really nice, well presented and with good qualities. The new chef is also very creative, he presented a huge 'fruit basket' with dry ice effect and that was complementary.. really appreciate that great effort!Would highly recommend this restaurant for family, social gathering and functions.M/M Wong, Nov 11,17"

Worst steak i have ever eaten, undercooked and tasteless. The sauce was so overpowering i thought i was eating lemon curd. The bill was 130 sing and money not well spent.

Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and then directed to a smaller room. We then sat and did the Omakase menu. Our Japanese chef nailed all the courses, with everything perfect from the delicate fish to the warmth of the rice. He also recommended some off menu Sake which is from his home town. Was delicious. Looking forward to my next visit. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,On the fence,negative,30,11/13/15,"Had lunch with friends about a month ago and we all found the duck and char siew pretty yummy. I like my pork slightly fatty and the char siew at London Fat Duck had just the right balance, in my opinion. It was also nicely charred on the outside. The duck meat was moist and tender. And not gamey. Service was prompt. I returned once to do a takeaway. Something I wouldn't do again. The taste just wasn't the same and everyone at home felt it was no better than the roast duck at our nearby food centre. This proves once again that many foods are best eaten on the spot. I'd be happy to go back to London Fat Duck for that plate of duck noodles or char siew rice if there isn't any queue."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Highest quality sushi, but lack of variety",positive,40,6-May-15,"Having heard about this restaurant's stellar reputation, I went to the branch at Raffles Hotel for lunch. You definitely need to book ahead to eat here, as the place is small and there are only 18 seats around the sushi counter (they do have private rooms but you won't see the actions from there). Several guests were clearly regulars, which is a good sign for restaurant of this level.The lunch set menus start at $75 up to $250, which can be considered ""cheap"" compared to dinner ($220 to $450). The $250 option comprises of about 9 nigiri sushi plus appetizer, sashimi, and cooked dishes. If you are a lover of Japanese cuisine, the usual suspects for high-end sushi are likely to be in the menu (the fatty tunas chu-toro and o-toro, sea urchin, bonito). But the most impressive items (that I had not seen before) came at the start - the baby squid and the translucent baby eel, both served as sashimi. As for the quality of the cut and freshness, you can hardly complain - this is probably as good as it gets, at least outside Japan. However, with this price tag I'd really like to see more variety in the set menu. Tuna came up several times, as did sea urchin. They could, for example, serve more shellfish, e.g. clams or oysters. And the dessert (green tea ice cream and melon) was too plain for me. I honestly didn't get all the fuss about Japanese melon - for me it only tasted slightly better than the normal one. So I was satisfied, but not extraordinarily so. Perhaps if you go for dinner and pay $450, you'd get more ""exotic"" stuff. But then it's getting to be too expensive. Or you can try bringing a gift (a bottle of sake) for the head chef and the staff, which is what the regulars do. This might persuade the chef to part with some of his more prized possessions..."

We are ok with waiting for a table, but once seated, I really don't enjoy people having their order taken who arrived and sat down at least two groups behind us. The food was good, and their baguettes are excellent. I would try it again, but why when there are so many other great restaurants in Singapore."

It is easy to get to from the MRT line and it has fantastic options for local cuisines. The outlets are graded from A-D for their health code practices. Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on. Cleaners bus these way to be washed and distributed back to the vendors but it is not looked favorably on if you just leave them on the table. Its a good system really.Smoke only in designated smoking sites.Try as much unusual foods as you can or taste your favorites done authentically Singaporean style ."

In the end we left since the staff werent even interested in making any attempt to accomodate us. I wont even rate this restaurant a one but the app wont let me."

The set dinner is really very worth it as it comes with a salad or soup of the day , a main (salmon or chicken), a dessert of the day and a drink (iced peach or raspberry tea) for just $15.80++.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Don't waste your money,negative,10,22-Mar-13,"My wife and I ate at L'entrecote recently, and quite honestly it was the worst food I've had in Singapore, and indeed possibly anywhere in recent memory. My wife ordered some foie gras terrine to start, and upon arrival noted that it was 'wet' - it certainly looked very unappealing to me. She was able to eat maybe two knifefuls on the toast, but had to give up after that. The texture was terrible and the foie had not been properly prepared at all.The only main dish available is the supposedly famous entrecote with the special sauce and frites. The meat simply didn't taste of anything resembling beef. It was absolutely dreadful quality meat. There isn't really anything else to say about that. The supposedly golden crisp frites were mass catering frozen chips that bore virtually no resemblence to the frites you might expect in Paris (or virtually any other city). The entire dish was totally unappealing and devoid of any decent flavour.The service was good and pleasant enough, and the wine was drinkable (just), but I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am familiar with the 'L'entrecote' concept from Paris and London, and it is good, but if you are only really serving one thing, you have to do it really well, and this restaurant fails in every respect on that front. Even their story about the origins of the concept on their web page is wrong."

While I was happy that they did not scrimp on the portion of the salmon, the fish didn't taste very fresh and it was quite oily when it was supposed to be grilled. Same with the salad that came with the dish. At least my husband enjoyed his steak which he said was pretty good and well prepared. Service was good and efficient. Located at Robertson Quay, the restaurant has a lovely view of the river that runs next to it.

We made a reservation for 6 persons but were 10 persons in the end. Even the restaurant was fully booked, they arranged a bigger table for us in no time and service was always friendly and attentive. Though the crabs were really big and succulent, I feel the price was a bit hefty (around 1200 Singapore Dollar). I had excellent crab in a less exclusive setting at much lower prices in Singapore before. Also it was a bit of a let-down that they did not serve stingray, which is a real delicacy in Singapore.Nothing bad about the food or service, but next time I will probaly go to a less exclusive place enjoying similar excellent crab (and stingray!)."

I didn’t have any expectations as the restaurant was selected by a client and I didn’t bother to look at reviews prior to going there. The ambiance is fine, though it was a little dark if that bothers anyone. I’m not sure I’d characterize the wait staff as indifferent but they certainly were not very attentive. Fortunately, we were sitting near the end of the bar and our waiter was regularly at the bar, so we were able to call him over when necessary. We ordered the duck foie gras for four (SGD $158) as a starter. It was excellent, though not as much as I’d expected for the price (two livers sliced at the table). I had the grilled tuna and the waiter asked if I wanted it pink. I answered in the affirmative but thought it a strange question given that in the U.S. one only gives cooking instructions if one doesn’t want it almost raw in the middle. If there was any pink when it arrived the room was too dim for me to see it. It was cooked well done and very, very chewy. For dessert I had the fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was small and impossible to tell if the strawberries really were fresh or frozen. Out of fairness, one of my companions had the veal and pronounced it excellent. Another companion had the roasted spring chicken and seemed equally impressed.I should also note that this restaurant isn't ranked as high on some other review sites."
French,Saveur,First date,positive,50,3-Sep-17,Went to Saveur at Cathay for my first date. Had to say the food was really good and value for money. Ordered the set lunch which was only at 22.90. Had the appetizer pasta(forgot what it was called) which was really good. Main was saveur's signature confit duck which was really well done too. Only qualms was with regards to the portion of the dessert which could have been a little bigger in portion. But overall was really satisfied with the food. 
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Great food!,positive,40,30-Jun-15,"The place is clean and pleasant.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Deteriorated,negative,20,30-Jul-17,I've come here before. This time the sashimi was thin and wasn't presented as well. The skewers were a letdown - dry and lacking flavour. My only comfort is that we were using half-off vouchers
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Talking about Japanese Fine Dine: Head to Waku Ghin… You won’t be disappointed!,positive,50,22-May-16,"The best Omasake dinner I’ve had! It’s true that it is costly (400+ per pax) but then again, for the experience as special as this…it’s all worth it ? To start with, the service you’ll enjoy is very exclusive. Together with 4 friends, we had our own private dining room… own Chef and Sous-Chef that took extra good care of us all through out the night plus army of staffs that treated us like we are the most important people in the world! We started with cocktails. Very interesting cocktails that I never had anywhere else but there… Then we were escorted to our private dining room. The chef took time explaining the 10-course meal he prepared for us. Every detail of the 10 beautifully presented dishes has been kind of whispered to us while we were enjoying them. Except for the main dish which we were asked to decide on (based on the menu), all the rests were the Chef’s choice. There’s of course over flowing sake that accompanied our sumptous meal. And for the finale - we were once again escorted to the main room where all the guests are directed for the much-awaited dessert. Well you can already guess by now that we’ve once again served with nothing but the best. The one thing stuck in my head is the “black forest” that looked nothing like the usual. There are only 4 private dining rooms and 1 dessert room. So it is a must to call in advance and reserve. If you’re reading this, you must be really considering Waku Ghin ? I’d say first that am jealous! Second, you won’t be disappointed. Enjoy!"

Only letdown was the online ordering system as it did not capture our initial order though a message prompting 'order sent' was seen. We were left waiting for quite a while and upon checking with one of the staff, was told that they did not receive the order and we had to key in our orders again. Also, our request for refill of our plain water was left attended and we had to request again. In the end, one staff just came and left a tumbler of water on our table."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Masala chai flan was to die for!,positive,40,1-Dec-12,Excellent food & service.... Pretty authentic Indian food which I'm used to back home . The highlight most certainly was their Masala chai flan which was to die for.

The starters and desert list were great too and the choice was a lot wider. Nice house wine and great atmosphere in restaurant.

French,Angelina_MBS,Hated this place. Their famous Mont Blanc cake was awful.,negative,10,13-Jul-15,"The entire place was really cramped and had the feel of a cafe that was trying too hard to be upmarket (but failing disastrously at it). Service was poor and slow and their famous Mont Blanc cake was probably the most awful cake I've ever eaten in my life, with chestnut cream that was overpoweringly sweet and so dense that you could have stuck a fork in it and not have your fork threaten to fall out at all. Upon checking with the staff, I realised this was because their cakes are flown over from France (which to me, simply means their cakes aren't fresh and which lack of freshness showed up in each bite).Their other signature was their hot chocolate drink. This fared a little better but was too thick and rich to be enjoyed beyond the first few sips.With such stiff competition from other cafes and dessert places in Singapore, it's hard to imagine this place doing well beyond the first 6 months in Singapore."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lifeless at lunch and not an environmental friendly food center compared to Whampoa Food Center,negative,20,20-Jan-16,"We explored the Newton Hawker, Lau Pa Sat and a local hawker center called Whampoa Hawker Center during our recent trip to Singapore. Amongst the 3, we rated Newton the lowest. We visited Newton and Whampoa for lunch respectively. Whampoa, which is connected to a local housing estate, has long lines in many stalls during lunch and is full of life. We were indeed on our way to Newton and the taxi driver recommended Whampoa instead of Newton. We tried the Hainanese boneless chicken rice, and the spicy turnip, peanut, bean sprout, pineapple salad at Balestier Road Hoover Rojak, made famous by HK movie star Chow Yun Fat. All utensils are reusable, a big thumbs up from our family as we care a lot about the environment. The atmosphere is friendly, pricing is affordable and the service is great. The next day we made a trip to Newton because of our positive experience at Whampoa. Over 2/3 of the stalls at Newton were not opened, so it's pretty lifeless. We had a Ba Kut Teh (pork rib soup) and a roasted chicken rice. Food quality was okay. Yet the food stalls in general use a lot of disposable utensils and styrofoam. It is not at all impressive. Please also note that Newton will be closed for renovation from Feb - Apr 2016."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Didn't even step in and already a bad impression.,negative,20,12-Jul-14,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec **The only reason why I'm rating this restaurant as ""Poor"" and not ""Terrible"" is because I didn't even step foot into it, so I can't judge for the food or atmosphere. I rang up for a reservation on a Friday evening and I got a guy telling me that their reservations were full. Even before I could ask if I could walk in to try for a table, he said, ""OK. Bye."" and promptly hung up.I understand that Friday nights are busy but this was incredibly impolite. If the service is like that on the phone, I dread to think what it's like in the restaurant. I'm avoiding this place at all costs from here on."

French,Paul,Rudely turned away,negative,10,12-Sep-18,"Paul’s Paragon, Singapore. My family approached and waited at the greeting station to be seated. Many employees saw us waiting. No one approached us or greeted us. We saw an empty table near the back of the restaurant and approached it to seat ourselves. We were promptly and rudely told the table was reserved and they didn’t have a table for us. We will never eat at Paul’s again because of their poor attitude and disrespectful service. I will go out of my way to advise all friends, family and business associates to bypass this restaurant. There is no excuse for poor rude service and attitude."
French,Saveur,Horrible Food and service!,negative,10,8-Oct-14,"Went to Concetto by Saveur thinking the standard is as good as its sister restaurant in Purvis street but I was totally WRONG! I had the seafood soup which was the only dish I think is quite good. For starter I had the saveur's signature pasta but compared to the restaurant at Purvis street this one was totally dry and tasteless! Next the Kurobuta pork cheek for my main course had this intense ""pork smell"" and it was so strong that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The duck confit which was ordered by my friend was also mediocre. The service was also below average I sat there for 15 mins waiting for friends to come and yet no service staff bother to ask if I needed a drink! Overall food and service suck!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Honeymoon sushi,positive,50,25-Feb-18,"When investigating restaurants for the start of our Honeymoon in Singapore, one stood out from the crowd - Shinji at The Carlton hotel, why.......The promise of an intimate and authentic sushi experience - we were not disappointed!We left the dish decision to our sushi master chef Oshino and boy did he deliver, from the three different ages and types of tuna to the two different types sea urchin, every dish was incredible to look at let alone taste.Watching the master himself, chef Oshino, was a true honour, the preparation of every dish was a joy to watch, so meticulous and precise.Our visit totally changed our opinion on sake, the choice was overwhelming but the waiting staff helped us with the perfect choice.We left feeling truly spoiled and that we had experienced a truly magical culinary experience.Some people say that Shinji is too expensive, I say you get what you pay for and we got culinary excellence and one hell of an evening.We will be back - we just do not know when."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Disappointed,negative,30,03/22/13,We thought we would try Long Beach as we had been in Jumbo the week before and wanted to try a different seafood restaurant. But we were disappointed in the food. The seafood hor fun that we ordered arrived in a lump and look very unappetising and didn't taste any better. The sharksfin soup was missing the sharksfin! Most of the food that we ordered was of a poor quality and the service was also rather poor. If you are thinking of having seafood in the Dempsey area I would suggest that you go to Jumbo and give Long Beach a miss as they are more expensive and the food quality is poor.
French,Paul,Nice environment,negative,30,11-Jul-12,"Went there for breakfast as the breads, pastries and tarts look tasty. The place was very nice though but the breads are some how a little disappointed. The baguette was a little under proof as the result for after baking, the bread was soggy on the inside, very chewy.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday treat 2017,positive,40,26-May-17,"As a show of appreciation for customers patronage, they're treating birthday celebrants to ala carte buffet lunch within their birthday month accompanied by at least one paying companion. And what a treat it was! You choose & tap your desired dishes from a tablet and with just a short wait after sending your order, food is served. Want more? Then tap tap tap again. As long as you don't waste food. Service was quick. The food quality was very good with really fresh sashimi & other ingredients. Beautifully plated. One improvement needed though is to train the staff to be more hospitable. It's fine even if they do not smile for as long as they do not sulk as well hehe. Anyway, why are they looking sullen? Maybe they need some positive incentives. Just saying. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Average food, sullen waitresses",negative,30,10/6/2012,"The dim sum was pretty average - nowhere near the Crystal Jade standard. Restaurant has a quaint chinatown location, but the waitresses were pretty unfriendly and some even quite rude. I wouldn't go back there."

All costed 52 SGD. * They close their kitchen very early like 10:30 PM and don’t serve food after that. Which was a big surprise for us . * Singapore city where it’s not easy to find good vegetarian restaurant, this restaurant stands out and serves good quality tasty food ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Quality Dim Sum,positive,40,04/14/15,Really decent quality dim sum without the usual surly waitress service. Nice to be able to watch through a window into a prep area where they make the dumplings etc. High quality but pricey with it and a bit put off by the coach parties of well-heeled tourists. 
French,Poulet,Inexplicably popular below-average restaurant,negative,20,30-Jun-14,"This seemed to be hugely popular with locals so we gave it a try. Sadly I can't understand for the life of me why it's such an attraction.The signature dish, chicken, is OK. To western tastes the standard cream & mushroom sauce will likely be far too sweet (I'm pretty sure it was mostly condensed milk, not cream) and although the chicken is OK it's nothing special and needs the sauce as the breast can be a little dry.The sweetcorn potato side order was tiny and tasteless, the fries were fine (though it's hard to screw those up) and the overall experience felt like bad hawker centre fare.Service wasn't brilliant, our starters were completely forgotten and when ""they"" arrived they had forgotten my order. In the end, looking at 4 limp frankfurters on a plate and thinking they were far from French garlic sausage I just let it go. Condiments have clearly just been scraped onto the side of the plate from the jar and left a lot to be desired on the appearance front. At least we were only charged for the one starter that was delivered.In a nutshell it wasn't dreadful but against the competition I cannot for the life of me understand why this place is still in business and, seemingly, so popular. Even bog standard chicken rice is nicer."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper crab ever,positive,50,1/8/2016,"Basically, we echo what other reviews have already mentioned. If money is not an object, do go for a treat. Between my wife and I, we ordered 800g of Black pepper crab, deep fried fish (Yaw cham soon hock), mushroom and vegetable tofu and two drinks. It was S$168. It was pricey but the crab was the best we have eaten. What was surprising was the fish! It was so well done and tasty. Soft and fluffy with a simple but yummy soya like sauce. Overall, it was a real foodie experience. Unfortunately, there were no razor clams that day. A real disappointment. To be honest I have not tried others like Jumbo or many other places but I will definitely go on a foodie hunt next time we are back in Singapore. You might want to try their set menu which cost somewhat similar but you get desert. You might want to ask how much crap you get."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Perfect. Sublime. Gastronomic experience,positive,50,29-Aug-14,"It was a perfect night just what you would expect from Tetsuya. Yes you do need to take a morgage out to dine here but it was worth it! There was no pretentiousness at all, it felt intimate as there was only 7 of us at the table and didn't see the other guests, we had a chef all to ourselves and we had at least two wait staff. The sommelier was wonderful he made the night for us, his choices were divine especially the Pinot wine. He was so accommodation to my daughter (she's 8yo) and even picked matching drinks for her, at the end of the evening he gave us a private tour of the wine room. We also got yo go in the kitchen and have a peek which was awesome. The highlight of the night was of course the food it was so fresh and cooked just right respecting the produce. Everything was melt in your mouth delicious, perfect balance in taste. It really was a gastronomic experience. A must for any foodie. I don't understand how this could be number 50 in the worlds best restaurant list below Attica which I went to the week before (read my review). Unlike Attica the theatre was in the cooking & produce. This is what you would expect from a top restaurant and they definitely delivered. A memorable experience. "

The idli and dosa are the favourites. The service is courteous but not professional. Set your expectations right before the visit, the food is what's you're there for and its well worth it....More"
French,Saveur,Friday 20th May,negative,10,21-May-16,Meal was served wrongly. Duck confit was hard. Seabass tasteless. Full house on a Friday night yet they were severely understaffed. Wasn't as cheap as I heard it would be. It was almost $70 for 2 pax.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not worth the hype,negative,30,02/26/15,"Visited Jan 2015 during our Chinatown Night Tour. We had a fixed dinner, starting with herbal rose tea, which was nothing more than rose scented hot water in a kettle. The other items in our dinner menu was ok. Though it was included in our Chinatown tour, the quality and quantity was not fulfilling. But we had a good tour team and we enjoyed our time throughout the tour and this place gave us a chance to sit and talk with each other. The restaurant was somewhat crowded with lots of locals and tourists and it was surely understaffed. Our server picked up our dishes couple of times before we even finish our food, which was not good. Didn't had a chance to order other items from the menu as it was a fixed meal. Lots of other eateries in Chinatown, so this can be skipped unless you're in a tour which includes dinner here."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistently good,positive,40,8/10/2013,Every few years we visit Singapore and this place is always on our list. It never fails to deliver the best Sri Lankan Popular Chilli Crab dish with bread--over 1kg for S$68. You don't need anything else---well maybe a Tiger Beer or two!!!!!! Sit inside in the air-conditioning.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Handy for lunch / early evening local food,positive,40,10-Jun-13,"Easy to get to (walking distance from Orchard Scotts residences where we were staying), and with many options for local street food. Cheap and cheerful, but with friendly service - a number of the vendors remembered us after only one or two visits."
French,Saveur,Freshly made pasta,negative,30,4-Aug-14,"We happened to pass by and decided to pop in. Perhaps they were trying for a zen like place, with concrete benches and minimalist decor. The crowd was mostly in their 20s.Foodwise, we liked what we ordered. We started with the grilled octopus, with fennel leaves and lemon aioli. It was fresh and light. We also had the prawn aglio and the duck tortellini. The prawn pasta was good, with the right amount of spiciness and was not too oily. The tortellini was nice and not too firm, though I did think that some of the duck tasted a little strong and gamey. Overall, the dish was good.Portions are smallish, but prices were also reasonable. Service was friendly and quick.They also have a French bistro over at Far East, so do try that out too."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Modern Japanese Cuisine with Excellent Service,positive,40,23-Aug-15,"serving modern japanese cuisine, bringing new twist to the usual ones you used to have. excellent service, extensive wine collection available."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","SHOP 70, NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT SINGAPORE CAN OFFER",negative,20,6-Sep-15,"I have been going to Singapore for over 40 years and have always had a good opinion of the people and the food over the years, so much so that I suggested to my friend on her first visit to Singapore that we eat at Newton Hawker centre for dinner. I had a Thai meal which was lovely but my friend fell for the slick, smooth talk of the lady serving on stall number 70. As is normal you pay by the weight in seafood but I doubt that any stretch of the imagination could accept that one prawn cost $22 as the serving lady said it was 150 grms - firstly that was added up incorrectly and when we pointed that out to her she flew into a rage saying that my friend was getting it cheap, secondly that was the end of the service - no cutlery, no drink, no serviette and rude whispering behind my friend's back, plus having the fan moved from us to them. It was a particularly humid evening. I do not know if the owners of that stall realized how much their shop will be effected by a rude and aggressive employee but I do know that the owner next door to them was very apologetic to my friend over the rudeness of the employee in shop 70. A word to everyone - ask to watch when your prawn or other seafood is weighed and also make sure that the maths are correct when you get the bill and do not be afraid of speaking up if it is not right.  Would I go back again - probably not because I have been to a lot of hawker food areas in Singapore and I think that Newton has out priced itself for no good reason and unless you travel by train it is very difficult to get a taxi in that area."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Average food and wasteful portions !!,negative,20,23-Jan-16,"We have always been wanting to give this restaurant a shot and finally ended up here while talking a walk around the area. Service: nothing extraordinary.Food: average - definitely not worth the price. Most importantly, portions for the mains are just excessive and lead to a loads of wastage. Management should either rethink the portions or else inform the customers accordingly. We didn't find it worth at all. Better places in Robertson quay - you can give it a miss !!"

Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Vegetarian Indian Restaurant mainly for south Indian delicacy,positive,40,2-Sep-16,"Although slightly priced, but worth trying at least one time. You can enjoy any kind of vegetarian food here within your budget. Kids loved the ""save puri"" and the jaleebi's."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Truly amazing,positive,50,23-Dec-12,"From the get go it was a sublime experience.The dining experience is very much ingredient focussed. A lot of places these days lay claim to being just that.Waku Ghin however is the true mascot of that philosophy ""Ingredient Focussed"".The pairing that was recommended and organised by Mr. Francesco ""Flamboyance"" Galdeano was spot on for every course.A truly excellent experience overall.Will be back the next time I am in town.Kudos to Chef Kok who was our chef for the evening. He was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Phenomenal food, excellent service, memorable ambience!",positive,50,26-Jan-16,"I had the pleasure of luncheoning at Angelina's recently. What a find! Their truffle ravioli is the perfect rich, velvety comfort food that I'd like to drown myself in after a long day (and might I mention one of the nicest I've tasted in Singapore).The service was impeccable, the ambience makes for the perfect parisienne experience (complete with the essential street-side people watching, even if it's in a mall! :)) The desserts looked sinfully delightful, except I was stuffed by the time they rolled around. But the famed hot-chocolate is on my list of things to try next time - reserved for rainy afternoon with good friends."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good quality food and good service,positive,40,07/28/16,"We had a small family dinner for my sister's birthday at Peach Blossom. It's a small cosy restaurant which serves generally good Chinese food esp yifu noodles and salted egg prawns. The waiters/waitresses were pretty attentive. The only issue was that the food came rather slowly when the restaurant was full.The staff who attended us wes very good, especially Nobel and Christine who even sang the birthday well wishes for my sister."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Enjoyable meal,positive,40,23-Dec-15,"Went to Kailas Parbat as we longed for home food, was not disappointed. Was really satisfying to eat here after shopping at Mustafa Centre. Avoid going there on Public holidays as its too crowded. try going in the afternoon when its not crowded. Tasty food, good service with a smile.Was served well."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hit and Miss Chaat But Awesome Dal Khichdi,positive,40,15-Oct-18,"Somehow Kailash Parbat's outlet in Little India doesn't get any reviews - people are perhaps posting their reviews on the other outlet. Nonetheless, this place is supposed to be your go to place for Chaat even in the streets of Little India where there are so many other options. We went there on our first night itself thinking that if we liked the place we could eat here often during our 5 day stay. But sadly we never returned because we were not completely satisfied. For starters we ordered a Sev Puri (SGD 7.5 +) and Ragda Dahi Puri (SGD 9+). The Sev Puri was spicy and delicious just like you would get in India. But the Ragda part of the Dahi Puri turned out to be disappointing - it was bland and basically boiled chickpeas - completely without flavour. We didn't eat more than half the dish and decided to order main course (which we hadn't planned to) - Daal Khichdi (SGD 12+) - which was the hero of the day. Piping hot and just how they taste in local Mumbai restaurants - it was absolutely delicious.The service was prompt. They were also kind enough to see that our kid was not enjoying the chaat and gave him a complimentary bowl of muri and namkeen mixture. Rates are slightly on the higher side for the chaat but would have been worth it if the flavours were right. A 34 SGD bill for 2 chaats and a single main course is one of the more expensive tabs you will pay in Little India."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",THE sushi bar,positive,50,22-Sep-17,"One problem there is with this place - it annuls all the sushi you've eaten before. Unless you've been to a similar establishment in Japan or Hong Kong (let's face it, the chances are low), Shinji is going to be your maiden genuine sushi experience. We felt literally like savages being civilized here. You eat nigiri sushi several seconds after they were prepared.You don't handle soy sauce and wasabi - it's for the chef to decide the sauces in what you're eatingWe had a set consisting of a starter, 14 nigiri sushi, miso soup with sakura shrimp and a dessert. And that were definitely the best ones we ever had. Different kinds of tuna, needle fish, sea urchin roe, shrimp and all. The place is a real eye opener on what a proper sushi is."
French,Paul,Perpetually crowded,negative,30,24-Sep-15,"Food is alright, but dine in experience wasn't that good. Then again you may be better off just to grab and go. Ultimately its standard bakery stuff, above average quality."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Amazing Fish head curry,positive,50,8-Sep-15,Had the fish head curry. Portions are HUGE! we ordered a small and the curry with rice was plenty for 2 people. The curry tasted fantastic. It is amazing how much meat there was on just the head.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck but average dim sum,negative,30,3/7/2016,"Xiao Long Bao is juicy and meaty but the dipping sauce is salty with little ginger . Dried wanton noodle is eaten best with chilli sauce , only comment is quite pricy with little noodles served. ""Ting chai"" congee is actually congee with cuttlefish and peanuts . But the peanuts too hard. Duck is juicy and oily , if you don't mind the oil. Meat is tender. Service is good. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Exquisite dining,positive,50,19-Oct-16,"We dined here as a couple and everything was just perfect. I loved the intimacy of just two couples in the room watching the chef work his magic. The 10 dishes were fantastic, particularly the marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and caviar. Great ambiance and really just fine dining at its best. Highly recommended."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Mumbai chaat!!,positive,40,5-Nov-17,"Visited here last week ( Nov 17) for lunch, reached around 3pm and found them to be closing soon. we had ordered Pao Bhaji and it was made with utmost perfection. We found it to be the best Pao bhaji we had outside of Mumbai or Pune. Quite a few other options in chats and indian fare. I'm sure one would not be dissappointed."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as bad as people say,positive,40,9/9/2015,This is like a classic old school dim sum restaurant. Yes if they give u clean wipes and pickles/ nuts they will charge u for them but this is quite normal. The Ha Kow was very good. The chicken Wings in a bag were too oily for me. The cheung fan with prawns was average but not bad. Overall I give this place a 4 and was glad I tried it
French,Poulet,Could have been better,negative,30,14-Jul-15,"Poulet occupies a choice location on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Point. It's normally packed at lunch time and on weekends but it was relatively quiet on a Monday night. I decided to order their signature dish, the poulet roti (rotisserie chicken) which came in a shallow dish of mushroom cream sauce with some spinach leaves sprinkled around ($15.90 for half a chicken). My dish arrived incredibly quickly, possibly within a minute. The cream sauce was quite nice and the half portion of chicken was more than enough for one person. However, it was clear that my chicken had been left for too long on the rotisserie as the breast meat was a bit dry and the thigh meat was alright but not juicy the way freshly roasted chicken should have been. The thigh meat had also darkened in colour, indicating that it had been heated for a while. I also found the dish a bit salty. The marinade had penetrated the thigh meat, but that meant it was also on the salty side. Perhaps if it had been a busier day, the turnover of dishes would have been faster and I would have received a more tender and juicy chicken. My glass of water was, as other reviewers mentioned, 50 cents, although to be fair, the waitress did highlight this to me beforehand. However, it was a nice, quiet venue to catch a quick dinner and the staff were quite friendly and attentive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Was expecting good quality,negative,20,23-Jul-14,"Not sure if I say poor would be fair but to my surprise it was poor at least what we ordered was not tasty at all, happened to visit kailash parbar in syed alvi road singapore in the evening on a weekday, ordered pani puri and it was awful to the core, its meant to be good for chats but I felt like I was eating plastic puris they were that hard I could feel they were not fresh at all they were literally like plastic, and the taste wasn't good, I couldn't chew in my mouth coz it wasn't even breaking it was that hard some weird taste, decided I will never eat pani puri ever in this place again, but I am assuming other dishes and roti currys will be good as they are served all day.Wouldn't recommend for pani puri at all"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service was slow,negative,30,12-Dec-16,"Food took long to serve. when we questioned, staff insisted all our orders were out. 2nd time, food was slow too. Took them 3 times to inform us the wine we chosen was sold out n we waited 20 min for it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Highly priced,negative,30,10-Aug-13,We ordered for home delivery today...we wanted to eat paneer chilly from a very long time but we were totally disappointed...it was really stale and pathetic in taste.. With such highly priced food we didn't expect such disappointing dish..!!!
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathay,positive,50,13-Mar-17,good experience to lunch @ Saveur on a Saturday afternoon. staff very attentive and courteous. food is really money for value.
French,Saveur,Sampling fine dining with low price,positive,40,9-Apr-15,Went there for a Sunday brunch with friends. I find that the menu price is very affordable but what surprises me more is that the palate leans towards French-Italian fine dining style. Service was average but that's because it was very busy. I would certainly come back again to try more from its menu.
French,Saveur,Worst of the saveurs,negative,20,13-Jun-17,I loved my food experience at another branch of saveur but this was nowhere near the same. The beef was dry and the pasta was average. The mocktail was tasteless. The server was new and didn't know anything when we asked her about recommendations.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Outstanding Indian Food!!! A must visit place for all :),positive,50,25-Feb-17,"Ambience - One of the very important things which anyone considers before going to any place, Kailash Parbhat at Imperial Hotel, sets the perfect tone for good lunch or dinner with your family and freinds!Food - This place is the one to go for any vegetarian north indian and indo-chinese cuisine! They also serve Jain food on request. The best part is that they have maintained the same taste of all their dishes which they originally started from India. Their speciality is chaat items specially Dahi Puri, Pani Puri, Chole Tikki ( The best in Singapore). Indian Chinese is the best so are their main course dishes. I personally like their Biryani. Since this chain of hotels is owned by a Sindhi, all Sindhi Delicacies are served on a Sunday!!! Trust me they are simply mouth watering and come with the same taste!!! In desserts their Kulfi Falooda and Jamun-e-Jannat (Rabri with Gulab Jamun) are something to die for!!!Service - Outstanding! Hope it sums it all.Price- Price is simply perfect. Approximately 40-50S$ for a 2 couples is a good value for money for some great quality food, ambience and service.A must visit for all Singaporeans and tourists from across the Globe!!!!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),One of my best meal in a Long time ,positive,40,7/12/2017,"With my friends who's mum was in the hospitality business. This family goes from from good restaurant to another awesome restaurant. You name it .... this family would have been there. Tonight, it was peach blossom for the first time. Why ? I asked my friends. Both brothers, both so much into good food, wines & whiskeys. They were here to give support to their new manager, Alden Gan. He was with another Szechuan restaurant before joining this joint.This is twice in a month for them visiting the restaurant. We kicked start la la (seashell congee) with black fungus. It was an excellent soupy dish. Next comes, the Yong Tau foo. Wasn't bad as the minced pork on the bean curd had a touch of salty fish which I really like. Fried asparagus was good but the coffee pork ribs were so good. A must ... here.Wagyu beef was next, wasn't bad followed by shiitake & mushrooms, really vegetarian n seriously very tasty too.My friends were loving the Wagyu beef so much that we had another order to what everyone's appetite. Next dish surprised me ... Cantonese cuisine n their special this month was the black flat Hokkien KL style noodles. It was superb. Very very good indeed. I would have finished the plate myself, tasty n reminds me of good Hokkien mee over in the state of Kuala Lumpur.Desserts of jelly & beautiful moon cakes were served. A good night & definitely I will be back with my other friends.Service was awesome. Restaurant manager, Alden Gan just made me a satisfied customer who would drop in again any time soon. 9.5/10 for food.10/10 service.9/10 ambience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Terrible service - No more crab available at 8.30 pm already!!!,negative,10,1/12/2012,"I went there for my family to taste their chilli and pepper crabs. When we arrived at 8.30pm on a Saturday night, we were told that the only available crab was teh Alaskan one, which is 400 SG$/kilo!!! What a joke. They told us the Sri Lanka cran would arrive during teh night, so we insisted to stay. After a million back and forth discussions with the staff, we finally were made aware that the crab would be delivered and we could have it. In the mean time, other people had to order the super expensive crab. The quality of the service was very poor. They made many mistakes in the order and the ladies giving away napkins and changing plates could not care less!!! I was very disappointed as I went there many times with an excellent experience. This time it was terrible!! Would not go there anymore"
French,Paul,Halal French Restaurant: Just Average,negative,30,27-Nov-13,"Nice decor however not as competent as other french restaurants i have been to. Service was pretty bad as waitress was not very polite in getting orders as well as not prompt in service. The food was nothing extraordinary. We had beef steak ($28.90) and seafood gratin( $24.90) and salmon croissant ($17.90). The seafood gratin is too cheesy. The bitter-ness from the emmanuel cheese does not help in making it taste better at all. The salad which comes with it taste so much better. However, the beef steak (can't rmmbr the actual name) was good. Sauce and dressing complements the meat well. The deserts were good (ordered the crepe -$7.90, the strawberry tart - $6.90, and the chocolate eclair - $6), the french baguette was tasty, soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Bill totalled to about $130 inclusive of GST."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Sushi I've ever had,positive,50,23-Dec-12,"My wonderful and now slightly broke boyfriend took me to Shinji for my birthday.Service was both faultless and intimate, the chef an absolute master. The quality of the sushi, sashimi and hot dishes was eye-opening - I made the mistake of asking if they had any salmon, to be told in no uncertain terms that no self respecting restaurant serves this fish! The bill was accordingly eye watering but both of us felt 100% justifiable, with this level of excellence you really don't mind."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,What an experience!,positive,40,3/6/2014,"A friend who had lived in Singapore suggested this place to us. And what an experience! We had pepper crab, which was divine and baby squid which was amazing! Coming from a country where seafood is plentiful I was skeptical about the outcome but this place really rocks. The restaurant was fully booked as people were still celebrating chinese new year but service was impeccable. Try to get in early to enjoy the scenery as well and avoid the queues. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience!,positive,40,22-Feb-14,"This was recommended to us and we were greatly relieved to find that the taxi driver knew where it was. He gave us advice, which we heeded, on eating at one of the outer layer of stalls. We talked to locals and visitors, asking them what they were eating, what they recommended etc and ordered some dishes from different stalls to share. They were all freshly cooked and very tasty. The value for money was incredible , the atmosphere was great as was the opportunity to talk to lots of different people about the food that they liked and we enjoyed it so much, we returned to sample more on a second night!"

Portions are quite good and lobster in lemon sauce was the best dish and praised by all the guests. Even roast chicken was very well done, crispy skin and succulent meat. Steamed fish was also fresh and tender. The special fruit yusheng was very refreshing with a variety of fruits but was a little too sweet with the dressing."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and wonderful service!,positive,40,05/14/14,"Celebrated a loved one's birthday last night at this popular seafood restaurant with some close friends. Gotten a private room that allow us to truly enjoy our dinner without any qualm of disturbing others or being disturbed.Wanted to have both the popular black pepper and chilli crab at the same time, the manager was able to make recommendation that allow us to order the set menu with some changes (with minimal additional cost due to my selection of dishes) to suit our taste bud. Both choices of crabs were delicious and the roasted peking duck was good too especially when they prepared the meat in their recommended cooking style.All of us have totally enjoyed the food and the evening of celebration and catching up.Will definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good food, good ambiance and good service. "
French,Saveur,Good Experience,positive,50,10-Sep-17,"First time dining at Saveur with a big group. We got a mix of the dinner set and ala carte. Each course came almost together, including the main course. Service staff was attentive to us, as they noticed that we had a missing utensil without us informing them for one. The food was really good in general, except that one of the dessert was not available that might. The salted caramel lava cake wasn't as delicious as we hoped, but the panna cotta was really good. Definitely recomend the duck confit and sea bass there. The salmon confit for appetizer is really good too, definitely a try for those who like sashimi. Truffle fries was a little too salty to enjoy the truffle taste well. Overall good experience!"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Peking Duck,positive,40,10/18/16,"Had the peking duck. They offer a half duck order so it was just right for me. They come to the table to carve it up and make wraps for you. They did it a little differently though, they rolled a piece of skin with with a pretty large chunk of green onion and cucumber. I would have much preferred if they julienne the green onion into small pieces. The duck also didn't have much flavor compared to other times I've had it."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't go a s a tourist as they rip you off,negative,10,2-Feb-18,"It's one of those places you feel you should go but it's expensive and they load the prices for tourists, only ever go for fixed prices and avoid the ones marked that you pay by weight as they always add S$20 on the price. Meal was very average to be honest."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",PATHETIC SERVICE !!!!,negative,30,27-Jun-15,"i visited this restaurant after going through reviews on trip advisor but hugely disappointed by there service. It took more than 20 minutes to get the order. Even a small request of providing plastic plate for my kid took them 15 minutes.the place is clean and can cater upto 40 to 50 guests at one go, but they have only ONE CHEF (as told by there staff to me) so if you are a a big family avoid this place because your order will take lot of time.The food was better than average, nothing I can complaint about the quality of food. but the service is awful I suggest the owner/manager of the kailash part to look into there service part as tasty food alone cannot help you build a reputation."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Brilliant,positive,50,29-Jan-14,"We have eaten at tetsuyas in Sydney a few times and haven't really thought it was phenomenal, but I can honestly say that Waku Ghin was fantastic. Yes it is expensive and yes there is not that much food, but my oh my it is clever and inventive and tasty. Sitting at a table watching a chef prepare the food was magical as he explained where the produce came from and why different ingredients were used. It's what we thought momofuku would be and wasn't. Brilliant seafood and excellent service. Definitely highly recommended by us! Domo arigato Suzuki san."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chinese New Year family meal,negative,30,1-Feb-17,Under-staff so the wait for food took longer than expected. The food quality also suffers as a result of the situation

There was no queue but still fairly crowded. Food was great , and had alot of variety with the waiters and waitresses pushing carts of dim sum goodness ! New for this mth includes Bak kut teh Xiao Long Bao which was tasty . If you have a craving for dim sum , pls visit Yum Cha at China town , you will leave the place satisfied ! "
French,L_Angelus,What a joke...,negative,10,26-Apr-14,"We are French, leaving in Spore since 5 years. We've tried many French restaurants, L' Angelus has been the most disappointing ever. Given the prices, compare to Le Gavroche or Le Bistrot du Sommelier, our expectations were quite high.Service really bad, attitude was good but due to lack of people we had to keep asking for water, napkin, had to go ask directly at the counter inside if we could get some ice water etc.Fish tartare was ok, then we had cassoulet and duck confit (south west French dishes), come on guys!! charging 40+ for what we had, are you joking? The confit was poor, oily, meat was dry, the cassoulet was blend. Honestly? You must change your chef. Last but not least they did a mistake on the bill, we got the bill from another table... Much higher... Glad we've checked. So sorry to write such a bad review. To end on a positive note I must say the house wine was good. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for family,positive,40,19-Apr-11,"The prices at Newton are several times higher than at neighborhood hawker centers. Nevertheless our family enjoys coming here, the kids like it. Usually a boisterous, friendly environment. Several can't-lose dishes such as pepper beef and chicken rice that the kids vacuum up. We always get lime juice to drink from one of the many drink vendors. The kids also like to practice with chop sticks. Although Newton is priced for tourists, the majority of the customers seem to be locals."

Lots of different choices, nice place to sit and easy to get to. (Take red line train to Newton and follow the signs). Prices were quite reasonable. I would recommend the indian in the corner.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Amazing restauarnt,positive,50,6-Oct-15,"This restaurant really is an experience. It is also outrageously expensive. The sea urchin was interesting to say the least. You sit in one of 4 small rooms. There were 3 of us in one room when I visited. Some of the food is brought to you already plated, and other meals are prepared in front of you by your personal chef. For desserts you go to another room. All great fun"

I was not disappointed. The house special shell-off prawns were excellent, as was the black pepper crab. All in all, a very enjoyable evening at an incredibly busy restaurant. Efficient service and really good value."

French,Angelina_MBS,No need to go back,negative,30,26-Jul-15,"(note: did NOT try the cake, so not an all-encompassing review)Three of us came here at 12pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't full but more people starting coming in at around 1230pm. Ordered an iced tea, a glass of Merlot, truffle fries and the signature hot chocolate (which was SGD12). My friend like the iced tea (I didn't try), she said it was fragrant and had other fruit essences in it so it was like iced tea with a twist. The truffle fries were fine. I was excited for the hot chocolate, but it turned out to be just okay. It wasn't hot enough and was too sweet - yes it's chocolate, but the sweetness balance was off. I actually liked the Max Brenner (Vivocity) hot chocolate better. The tables are really small, we had two tables pushed together and when all the plates/glasses arrived, it felt really packed. Service was okay. Unfortunately the whole area still smells like paint/construction. From what I've read about the Paris branch, this place is definitely not comparable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but not Great,negative,30,11/2/2013,Eating here may be a little intimidating for the non frequent traveller as within 1 minute of sitting down you will be presented with 5 to 7 bowls of food but rear assured this happens to each diner. Be prepared to say No and ask for the menu with pictures and english descriptions.The food was really quite enjoyable and the service was reasonable.There are some odd components though to this place like being billed for nuts that are already on the table and napkins (hand wipe) even though it was only $0.60.Is a real hit with locals though which is always a good sign.
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner,positive,40,7-May-17,It was a yummlicious dinner for my bestie's birthday. So glad she love the food & was so delighted. Definitely will be bck again soon.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent food ... disappointing wine.,positive,40,20-Mar-17,"L'Entrecote have some of the best steak and chips in Singapore, and the prices are good. The formula is adjusted slightly from the original restaurants in Paris and London - they offer starters in Singapore, and the seating is less ""intimate"". However, it still works - the restaurant is a favourite for me.The wine however is awful. Super ordinary (and super cheap) French and Aussie wine is priced up to $100+ a bottle and it spoils the experience somewhat. It's strange as the L'Entrecote Wine Bar next door (which also sells steaks, and presumably shares the kitchen) has a good wine list. A new sommelier or wine buyer is urgently needed!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the best Indian meals I have ever had.,positive,50,26-Mar-14,"Nice venue, excellent service and great value. The maitre'd came to our table and explained the slight delay as one of the dishes we had ordered, the Kebab Platter, was being freshly made, but it was well worth the wait. I cannot fault any of the dishes and generous helpings too. In fact so much so that we had to put in takeaway containers and had for lunch the next day, delicious even cold. I also enjoyed the Mango Lassi. Defintely recommend Kailash Parbat Restaurant in Little India."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant Buffet Lunch,positive,40,11-Jun-17,The sashimi was fresh and food was served promptly. There is a quite a wide selection of food items as well. But the sofa seating placement may be too near to each other with other guests.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Better than average Cantonese dishes,negative,30,5/10/2010,My Chinese wife likes this place a lot. Personally I think it's good enough but I wouldn't distinguish it from many other Chinese restaurants. However I defer to her greater knowledge of the Chinese food scene in Singapore.
French,Paul,Appalling service for mediocre food,negative,10,16-Dec-15,"Went for lunch with 4 colleagues. We were seated quickly and ordered fast. From there it was all downhill. Our orders arrived about 20 minutes apart with the last dish to arrive a very simple baguette with some lettuce and cold meat on it. Why did it take so long? One colleague gagged on a piece of cling film not properly removed from his chicken roulade. We advised the Chef who simply lifted the piece of plastic off my colleagues unfinished plate with his none to clean fingers without apology, offer of replacement or to strike the cost of the dish off the bill. We then ordered pastries for dessert. Despite the staff only having to lift them from the display counter literally right behind us again they arrived over a period of 20 minutes and again one by one. My cold cappuccino arrived last after everyone had finished. For this dreadful service and average food we paid a hefty 236 dollars. I noticed many other dissatisfied customers but astonishingly there was a queue of people waiting when we left. Never again! Paul management this place is severely damaging your global reputation!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Fast Food at its Best!,positive,40,5-May-12,"One of the better restaurants in Singapore serving variety of Indian Fast Food options (Chaat). From Delhi to Mumbai to Gujarat to Sindh...you have it all. And you will be surprised by the authentic flavours and taste. However, stick to safe options like Golgappe, Aloo tikki etc. New exotic options like (Masala Chhole Bhatura) could disappoint you.Range of sweets and beverages is also satisfying.Only downside is price...but should be okay for your desi craving.Note: They also have outlets in Mumbai & Hyderabad. Hyderabad (Inorbit Mall) was too disappointing...to say the least."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Perfect,positive,50,11-Dec-13,Eating here since last two years. The quality of food has never varied. The chola bhatura are best in Singapore. So is the Mushroom corm club sandwich. Chat platter is good. Rest everything is upto mark. Ambience is of fine dining.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old dim sum restaurant in chinatown,positive,40,9/1/2015,"This restaurant is located on the second floor in chinatown area. The restaurant is spaces and bright. Usually crowded during lunch time. Very traditionally decorated to give you a feel of the old times. The food is considered reasonably priced compared to restaurants in the prime area like orchard road. Food is good. I ordered steam ""char siu"" rice rolls, fried glutinous rice, steam char siu bun, deep fried yam, fried silver fish etc."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Not so bad,positive,40,21-Mar-14,"A huge place at the middle of Syed Alwi road serving some mouth licking food. Although they serve other then north indian dishes, but wouldn't advise to try it. They serve some amazing sount indian food and do the masala chai."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday celebration,positive,50,04/30/17,"I had a wonderful birthday dinner with my family's and friends. The service was excellent, thank you to the staff's who served us well - Alden, Nobel, Terry, Vivian, Mun Fong, Sun Jing, Christine and Sharon. I will come back in September for my friend's birthday."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best Steak Frites in Singapore,positive,50,11-Jul-17,"Went here for a birthday dinner and had such an incredible meal! The staff were wonderful, the service fast, the steaks perfectly cooked and the salads and bread delicious. Each steak comes with a good sized side salad, a lot of fries and a selection of four sauces as well as a complimentary bread basket. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth and only cost 39 dollars! Not bad at all. The creme brulee was excellent and I could have easily closed my eyes and been eating and drinking along the Seine in Paris. Highly recommend this place."
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur (The Cathay),positive,50,10-Sep-17,Food and ambience was good especially the foie gras and the pistschio pannacotta desert. Pork belly not so good but will try other food then next round. Service staff were nice. Thank you very much will definitely come back again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Unhealthy environment,negative,10,01/24/13,"Air conditioned restaurant filled with smoking incense. Huge turn off. Food was not cheap, but standard was somewhat above average. Nothing to shout about though."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Consistent Standards over the years,positive,40,21-Aug-17,"Had the $52 buffet (NDP promo) with 52 mins of free flow drinks and alcohol. Sashimi was thick and fresh as usual. What stood out were surprisingly the tori karaage. We had multiple servings of that. The skewers were awesome too, marination was on point, and they were all served hot. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Cheap food, cheap drinks, great deal",positive,50,10-Jan-16,"We knew the food would be good and cheap. The big bonus was cheap beer (compared to every other venue in town). A big bottle of Tiger set me back $9.50 which is considerably better than the $12 to $18 for a small bottle in other city venues. Food preparation was fast and the taste was awesome. Everything was fresh as these vendors go through a lot of product nightly. Go on your own, as a couple, as a family, or as a group of friends on a night out. Make this the starting point for dinner before hitting the town."
French,Saveur,Weekend lunch,negative,30,24-Aug-16,"Been to Saveur at Cathay. It is no longer called Concetto? We were a party of 3 with 2 set menus and ala carte orders and made a reservation through chope. Staff wasn't too attentive but it was probably because we were sitting at a corner?My friend had the mushroom soup but we both felt that it didn't turn out as expected. Other than the taste of mushroom at the end, there wasn't much taste of mushrooms. The mash potatoes on the duck confit was so sticky. Duck leg looks flatten into the mash. My medium rare steak was done to medium but it was great. Only problem is we were probably not use to the cheese in the herb butter. I was glad I tried a little of it before putting it on my steak. It was difficult to swallow and I wouldn't have eaten my steak if I put any on it. Dessert was the best. The consistency of the molten caramel that flowed out from the lava cake. It was just nice and not too sweet. The pistachio panna cotta had the taste of nutty pistachios. The creme brûlée has berries on it. However the moisture on the berries ruin the crisp of the sugar coating on top of the creme brûlée. It would have been better if the berries were not on top. It looked pretty though. I order a bottle of red wine and it was suppose to be 1-for-1. I had to bring it up before they bought me second bottle. Thank you for placing it in a bag and letting me bring that home even though the staff mentioned that promo was only valid if I drank it there. It didn't make sense for me to take up table space for another 2 hours just to open and finish another bottle of wine between me and my friend. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Extraordinarily expensive, but extraordinarily good",positive,50,8-Dec-13,"I've had the good fortune to dine at Urazawa and Masa and view Waku Ghin as in that elite company. Of course it's excellent and fresh, what elevates a place (for me at least) is the uniqueness of flavor profiles, combinations and presentations. This place has them. You look forward to each new course and are often wowed. I wouldn't pay to do any of these places twice, but I don't regret splurging on this once."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food and great service,positive,50,22-Mar-17,"This restaurant only has one main dish, steak and delicious unlimited, all-you-can-eat French fries, but they have several appetizers and desserts. I try to eat mainly vegetarian, so just had bread, cheese and salad and then French onion soup as my main even though it has beef broth. The only other two vegetarian options are endive salad (with blue cheese and walnut) and the classic Parisien leek & vinaigrette, which I have not had, so cannot comment. They are very child friendly and in a lovely location. Definitely recommended. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim-sum, but poor service",negative,30,10/17/13,"We can't make reservation to take dim-sum buffet in Jade of Fullerton Hotel.So we went another famous dim-sum restaurant named ""Yum Cha""It is located in temple street of China Town.There's so many people in queue even it's almost end of lunch time.There're many kinds of steamed and fried dim-sum.Most of dim-sum taste good, but service is very poor. We ordered and ordered repeatedly, but our dishes not served fast. So it took so long time to finish our lunch."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch ,negative,20,8/6/2016,Located in Scott's square. Food is so so only. The har kau skin is thick. I ordered their signature roast duck with roast pork as in photo. I was given the breast meat which consist mainly bones. Maybe just my unlucky day.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Above average food, below average service",negative,30,4-Dec-14,"I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and used their birthday promotion voucher. I brought along the email printout as the voucher stated which was actually required (I was lucky that I played safe instead of just using soft copy).The place is located at UE square which would require about 20 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT. But I would highly suggest wait for bus 54 just outside the Central. The ride will take at most 5 minutesThe food is above average. I especially like the sashimi moriwase and you can tell the difference from the quality of sashimi in cheaper restaurants such as the popular Sushi Express. The only horrible tasting food is probably their cold pumpkin dish. I also like that we can order from their tablet instead of having to call the service staff. This definitely helps reduce the service time and inconvenience of calling the staff. It will be helpful if the system could help tracked which order has been fulfilled, especially I usually order a lot in one goThe main issue lies with the service. There were only a few customers (3 tables occupied) during the time I was taking my birthday lunch, but it took me effort (at one point I almost have to shout) to get the attention of the staff. The staff lacked smiles also especially when we proceed with our payment.The boss definitely needs to train his staff in terms of service quality or else they will lose more customers. Singapore is a country where service buys you more customers compared to food quality when it comes to more expensive foodI would come back if there is another cheap promotion, otherwise at its default price, it is not really worth it due to their below average service quality and not so convenient location."
French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian tea room and patisserie ,positive,40,18-Aug-15,"Angelina's tea room and patisserie, has been a popular tea room in Paris since 1903. It opened a branch this year in the new Capitol Plazza, home now to luxury brands, Angelina's ambience was a bit disappointing. It was cramped, tables too near each other. We went to try their signature pastries and hot chocolate, to help a friend complete his Singapore bucket list. The hot chocolate was amazing and so was the Mont Blanc. But they're both rich and heavy so best after a light meal. We didn't try the mains. Like all trendy new cafes opening up here, prices are on the higher side. Service was pleasant "

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Spectacular!,positive,50,7-Jan-17,"The setting, level 2 of the ultra posh Marina Bay Sands mall and casino, is understated, chic elegance. As you approach the doors two attendants open them and bid you into a dark, slick bat/ lounge area where if you've arrived ahead of that pointed time for one of the two set mealtimes, you can indulge in incredible cocktail or mock tail and if tempted try a French oyster or two. Advice: do the cocktail and defer on the oyster... over the next three hours or so you are going to eat some of the finest (Japanese) or otherwise food on the planet.You sit in a private room at a Omakase style bar with just six people. Your chef starts with a presentation of the raw seafood ( the Canadian lobsters we're still moving) that will be incorporated into your meal... don't worry there will alsobemear courses: in our case Ohmi Wagyu and Tasmanian Grass fed beef. Do opt for a sake to accompany your meal....it's a rare selection that you won't find anywhere else. Our dinner consisted of 9 courses including abalone and marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and Oscietra caviar. Terrific selection of wines available by the glass or bottle. Once dinner is complete you move to a lounge overlooking the harbor for light dessert and beverage of your choice. Amazing desserts!It is not cheap, but from start to finish you are treated as royalty and most likely eat better than most royals. DO make an advance reservation, and unless you are a night owl, the 5:30 seating is ideal. We left at 9:00!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian restaurant in Little India,negative,30,13-Jan-14,"We were in Little India on the evening of the Dec 2013 riots. Walking around the place in the evening, we were surprised by the poor quality of restaurants and eateries in Little India. Being a Sunday, it was crowded and thankfully we spotted this restaurant which is a reasonably well known chain from India. While its facade looks average, the place is very nice from inside with efficient service, good food and stands out as an oasis where one can have a good quality meal in a comfortable, safe ambiance. While not a good place by itself, it stands miles above its local competition. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch/dinner in Little India."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so dinner,positive,40,3-Jan-16,Food quality was good but lack of variety compare to other jap buffet need to look into the menu selection not too much pork selection and someone like beef nt much in menu. Green tea ice cream we order was nt so gd was too sweet at first we thought was jus a matcha ice cream but it come with sweet bean way too sweet for us personally. Overall service is normal during dinning in the one guy who lead us to the table I forgot to ask his name he was friendly n very helpful the rest I think need abit of training couldn't smile much. Anyway overall experience is so so if compare to other similar restaurants u way below them. Food service was good that the plus point. Hope my next visit will see a better selection.

To have a waiter looking at us 10 more . finally , and that the comic part , one lost waiter among many comes to our table and say "" let me talk to the chef , i am not sure to place your order (12:30 pm ) ... 10 more minutes waiting ... waiter comes back and informs us that waiting time is 30 minutes .. we say ok but please take our order now . my husband orders 2 omelettes , cannot finish talking and waiter replies , let me talk to the chef ...seriously , why ?... and comes back , well 35 minutes .. if I were you i woud go somewhere else he says ... best part now , we are preparing to leave , hungry and a little bit upset after 45 minutes for nothing and we see 2 cookers coming from the kitchen , laughing and making their phone calls .. .."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service & food quantity can be improved,negative,30,25-Dec-17,The food quantity is too little per serving then up we must keep ordering and their service of clearing the plates is quite slow but service standards still considered quite okay..
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum at its Best so far,positive,40,04/28/18,"After 30 plates of these Dim Sum, we could hardly use words to describe.We give 2 thumbs up, for the variety, freshness, taste & services provided by the staff.Started with 10 bamboo containers all steamed to perfect hotness that even the soup base & prawns within the dumplings are fresh.The place was unassuming, on the 2nd floor but the number of tables occupied tells the tale this weekday afternoon, its now 3 o'clock.the clock reads 5.10 & yet 2 families streamed in with buffet orders.Our last order for desserts & that of the others were all served with smiles by the various staff & Mr Ken Wong stands out asking if we will like to top up the buffet spread.Our teeth is tired could not grind anymore & the stomach says stop.We will be back, Wifey beckon but with our parents & family next.The tea costing $3.50 was superior even for me (tea lover of over 5-8 cups daily).consider this as Hi-tea."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple Steak and Chips...Perfect!!!!,positive,40,13-Oct-15,"A nice cosy restaurant with a section next door. Was very busy next door, and as we didn't have a reservation, staff were helpful to give us a small table near the bar.Food was very nice, and the highlight was the pate they had on the platter we had as an appetizer.Nice simple menu, steak and chips, or a fish option. I went for the steak, and did ask the what Entrecote steak was, but was unsure even after I was told. It was a striploin steak, and mine was perfectly cooked to medium. Nice and juicy. Although I do prefer to cut the steak myself, but it was served already cut, Wasn't a big deal as the steak was nice.A slight mix up with the orders of my other friends on the table, but were very accommodating and remade the orders, and even gave us a free round of drinks."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below Average,negative,20,17-Aug-18,"On 15 Aug 18 we went to Shin Minori for a birthday celebration and choose their 53th birthday promotion. All the service staff seems clueless of this promotion and NON of them could tell us much about the promotion. The staff can’t even tell whether they are serving house pour or not for the promotion! So naturally we have no idea how the restaurant track 53mins as we were not told. One of the waitress can’t speak English and seems unhappy all the time. Why put her on the floor when she can’t even speak basic English and seems reluctant to be there? Wouldn’t she better off as a food runner or at the bar?There were 3 service staffs and a Manager on duty, the restaurant is NOT full, yet it was so difficult to get their attention for service. Service was slow, lost our orders and we constantly have to get them to refill more sake and beer. Cold Sake was served in a Tokkuri which I thought it’s more appropriate for hot sake and tiny cups. Beer was served in a small rocks glass that most restaurants in Singapore would use it for ice water. The restaurant will only serve us ONE bottle of sake for 4 persons and a beer in rocks glass. I wondered why because they could use bigger glassware and we will take a longer time for refills! It was very annoying for us because we constantly have to wave to get their attention. So I do not understand the rational of them serving drinks in this manner when their staffs have difficulty coping with refilling drinks! Or perhaps this is their ways of limiting our consumption? The staff did not inform us of the last order but simply told us that the promo has ended and we cannot order anymore Sake/beer which I think it’s really unfair. How do we know 53mins has ended? How does the restaurant track the time when they are struggling with service? I approached one of the waitress to clarify on this matter and of course she don’t have any explanation BUT we cannot order the drinks anymore. So I told her to check with the Manager and let us know since she seems unsure. She didn’t come back at all so after 20mins we approached another service staff to get their manager over. She was quite defensive and claims that her staff told us about the last order which she clearly did not. Long story short, eventually she gave us another round – reluctantly and she insisted my friend finished the beer before she serves another one. This is bad customer service! She knows we are annoyed so why aggravate the situation even more? How much will this less than half pint beer cost the restaurant?? Seriously if the restaurant can’t run this promotion properly and thinking of cutting corners, please don’t do it because it is bad for the restaurant and reputation. Our bill came up to $311.90 which is not worthwhile for the entire experience at all. We’ve decided on Shin Minori as most of us had good experience previously and food was good. I can’t say the same for last night, other than the Sashimi the rest of the food were pretty average and nothing great about it. Suffice to say this will be the last time we will be dining at Shin Minori because there are better and nicer Japanese restaurant around UE Square!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,affordable steak,positive,40,23-Oct-17,The steak is of big portion which can be shared if you are a smaller eater. Not really cheap but affordable for the quality. We had the bone marrow and onion soup too which is really delicious.
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Not worth it...,negative,20,22-Aug-16,The food taste were not great at all. The choices were less and the tandoori chicken was very dry and wasnt tempting at all. There was no chicken curry/gravy at all in the buffet. It is definitely not worth the money spent here.

Chinese,London Fat Duck,London Fat Duck @ Waterway Point,negative,10,04/21/16,"Crispy duck but the skin is not crisp but chewy.The filling inside the signature bun is sweet, taste more like chopped up bbq pork than duck! We ordered the original flavour without the pepper. Was served the pepper ones but as it is our first time in the restaurant and they do not have any me use with pictures for you to see while seated, we therefore was not aware that they had served u the pepper version until we took one and cut up to try. We told the waitress and they only replaced with 2 buns instead of the whole plate of 3! It's not our fault if they serve the wrong item but why should we be have only 2 out of 3 replaced! Chinese tea is not even warm let alone hot.The dish servings are very pathetic for the price ."
French,Paul,Terrible food and poor service ,negative,10,8-Jul-18,Ordered a steak and the meat was supposed to be cooked medium rare. Parts of it was raw and the rest was chewy. Really poor quality meat. The bread felt like it was baked yesterday and the fries were definitely refried. The creme brulee was the worst I ever had. Overall avoidable place with poor service to top it.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Terrible food,negative,20,24-Aug-14,"After reading good reviews and upon being suggested by a friend, went here for dinner. What followed was terrible .First up - The ambience is very good for an Indian restaurant in Singapore. Service is reasonably fast and efficient. That's where the good part ends. Now coming to food, we ordered Pani poori - very averageTikki chaat - terrible Pav Baaji - reasonably goodThai noodles -Had so much oil that you can cook for entire week for 1 person and very spicyBiryani - spicyMango lassi - reasonably goodWill never visit again."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good place for generous helpings of sashimi,positive,40,25-Oct-16,"My second visit to the restaurant was a little more hectic than my first. The iPad ordering service was down but the staff were quick to issue out order sheets. However, this resulted in slowing of service, duplicate orders, and some missing orders. However, the staff who was in charge, Winnie, was always friendly, patient and helpful. She even remained calm after another patron got verbally abusive because of the slow service. Food was good — my fave are the sashimi, crab cream soup, potato salad, etc. My child liked the chawanmushi a lot, and my parents the tempura.Overall, will visit again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good quality japanese buffet. Excellent service.,positive,50,5-Apr-16,"Pleasant trip. Good quality food, excellent service. Staff are attentive, but would be good if they are clearer with the ordering tablet. No one brief us to submit the order, end up we waited in vain for 20 minutes as we thought our orders were already processed. Else, everything was good."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious beef and shrimps,positive,50,05/26/15,"We ordered their specialties- beef wagyou and prawns with wasabi and mayo. The beef was tender and cooked just right. It had lychees which was unusual and heightened the meat's flavor. The prawns were big, topped with roe and were equally delicious. Fried rice with fish roe completed our meal. Even the jasmine tea that was served was good quality.Since we are staying at Marina Mandarin and it was raining, dining here was convenient. The setting is similar to most high end Chinese restaurants. We did not get to enjoy the view as mentioned in other reviews. Our table was far away from the window. Nevertheless, it was a very good meal."
French,Paul,Ticked off the 'to do list',negative,30,18-Mar-13,"My husband and I went to Paul for a Saturday breakfast. I had been planning on going for months after salivating at the wonderful array of pattisseries in the take away section. We had an egg, turkey ham, tomato and 'soft' bread plate. The food tasted fine, but it was nothing special. Price was OK at just under $10 for the meal. I had a cappucino which was very good. The carrot and ginger juice ( a bit pricey at $8) was nice. The service was fine - prompt and obliged us moving tables - but this was before the obligatory queues mid morning. The front area is very a bit cramped - not sure what you have to do to get an inside table. The pastries looked wonderful and I wish I had chosen the croissant and coffee."
French,Paul,Delightful find on the spur of the moment,positive,50,25-Jul-16,"My husband and I were in Singapore for the first time a few weeks ago. We'd been on the hop on hop off Duck tours, and we had done a lot of hopping on and off! We were famished by about 1:30pm, and had no idea where to get a good meal. We were shopping and happened by the Paul Restaurant. First impression was it was very clean and neat. Check! The waitress was knowledgeable. Check! The food was served quickly. Check! And it was delish.....hubby had soup and a sandwich, which I tasted and both were excellent. I had a nice mixed greens salad and cream of mushroom soup. Both also delicious. Oh, and the iced tea was as good as what you get at McAlisters in the US. And that is GOOD tea. All in all, I have to give them 5 stars. There was nothing we didn't like, and if we can remember where we were when we found Pau, we'll be back to eat there again in the future. Great job, Restaurant Paul. Oh, and we also took an eclair to go. Boy was that good. Its a little pricey, but nowadays you get what you pay for, and we don't mind paying for tasty food."
French,Saveur,Average but could be much more better,negative,30,22-Jan-18,Service wasn't that good. It probably slightly below average as the service crew was not proactive and not easy to engage them. Needs alot of improvement.

Served and pampered at a special counter. Had our own chef. The food was unbelivable, still remember the sea urchin dishes, and multiple creative variations around Japanese Food. One of the very best meals and services we gave had full stop."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Amazing Dinner,positive,50,5/11/2017,We stayed in the hotel and decided to go for dinner. We didn't expect much but was astonished at how delicious our dinner was. Peking duck and roasted pork were amazing. This restaurant serves better Cantonese cuisine better than others.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Small little eatery in the city center with good value and quality food,positive,40,11/15/15,"This restaurant used duck from Ireland, which has a nice layer of fat.After roasting, it tasted different from the local varieties.Other then the signature roast duck, which is good., the signature black pepper London duck bun is unique too.The bun had a thick layer of black pepper on it outer surface of the bun filled with duck meat. The combination gives a very interesting taste with sweet and peppery at the same time.The rest of the noodle and Tim Sum dishes are of good quality too.This is one of the few places in Singapore that serves Tim Sum after 3pm.I would return again to try the rest of the dishes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A bit over hyped,negative,30,2-Nov-17,"Went with a local who eats there alot. Mixture of locals and tourists. Large open area with tables. Tables also available along the edges next to the stalls. Try to get a table in the open area as it's less stuffy. Have someone save your table as you browse all the food stalls and then switch. Lots of options, though most offer the same fare. Prices are reasonable but I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the food. Make sure you bring your own tissues/napkins as they are not offered there."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Exceptional ingredients, great cooking mastery",positive,40,11-Jun-16,"An evening to remember. We arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar. Both of us let the barman design a drink around a single ingredients- sake for me, which resulted into a delightfully surprising result. We had a lovely chat with the sommelier around their wine list and were finally taken to our salon, sitting down at a bar in front of the cooking teppan. Followed 10 dishes that were all delicious, great ingredients, fantastic cooking and seasoning, very decent portions (how can one get out of the place feeling hungry as I read in some reviews is a mystery to me). I even enjoyed abalon, which I usually don't like. Great wine list too.The only slight area of improvement - the staff si sometimes so passionnate that they come a little too often to ask about the dishes and discuss, which may interrupt conversations. This is all with the best of intentions though."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Carrot cake,negative,30,22-Feb-15,Awesome carrot cake and pepper crab. Enjoyed the meals with family and friends. Quick service. Wish it was cleaner.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food choices not as great,negative,30,18-Dec-17,"Was here for dinner, I liked that they had a lot of choices for yakitori. But they did lack choices in terms of other cooked foods. Service was fairly good and price is also acceptable, overall experience was still acceptable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",one of the best buffet Japanese restaurant,positive,50,24-Aug-18,"I have to say this is one of the best Japanese ala-carte buffet restaurant. Food to choose from are wide range. Aside from that, they are quite delicious and tasty. The staff were prompted in clearing the empty plates"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very tasty dishes,positive,40,02/23/16,"My family and I visited the newly opened outlet at Punggol Waterway Point for dinner. We ordered the duck buns (HK ""Po lo"" style), steamed shrimp dumpling (har gao), siew mai, assorted 3 BBQ meats platter, shrimp/pork dumpling soup with noodles, vegetables with oyster sauce and signature rice rolls. The dim sum items were fresh and tasty and very similar to the good Guangzhou dim sum restaurants that I went to, but not as good as the HK ones. The rice rolls we ordered were actually deep fried spring rolls covered with a thin layer of smooth rice flour skin. Quite novel for me but not as tasty. The noodles were comparable with Canton Paradise and some HK restaurants. Shrimp/pork dumplings were very flavourful due to the fresh ingredients and had a good texture. But the best was the roast meat platter. The pork belly (sio bak) and roast duck could easily match those offered at fine dining Cantonese restaurants and the tender BBQ pork (char siew) had a rich and luxurious sauce. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Average steak; nice fries though,negative,30,22-Oct-17,"L'Entrecote is a restaurant with many starter and dessert options but just 1 main dish - the signature steak and fries. So non-beef eaters take heed! For steak eaters, you have the option of the regular (~190g) or XXL cut (~300g). Steaks were disappointing though. The issue wasn't with the doneness of the steak, but rather the questionable quality of beef being used. The fries were good though.Given the variety of steakhouses around, would probably not return."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place for Business dinner,negative,30,9/6/2016,"Good and convenient location near Orchard area. Nice environment away from the city with ample parking spaces. The place is crowded even during weekdays because of business dinners. If you plan to dine here advance booking is highly recommended.Food wise it is nothing to shout about. We had the usual chilli and pepper crab and tasted just like those in other restaurants. If you like the chilli gravy to dip the fried buns in, the chilli crab does come with a lot of gravy. Taste of steam fish is over powered by the spicy sauce. Sauce of the clam dish tasted just like that of chilli crab even though the waitress said it has sambal added. The silver fish fried rice was good though; very well fried with a little bit of crunch from the silver fish.Service was good even though you could tell they were struggling to manage. You can see diners getting impatient waiting for their dessert and bills toward the end of the night.Overall a good place for a business dinner but not for a family meal where you expect something special."

The chaat items we ordered - papdi chaat, sev puri and ragada sev puri - all ingredients (especially the fried items like boondi and papdi) tasted stale and old. I have eaten at this place several times over the last 5 years and the quality of food has plummeted. DO NOT EAT HERE. Costly and horrible food. Service is only decent thing about the place. The staff is prompt. We also ordered Gobi Manchurian (no taste, pieces too big so undercooked) and fried rice (too oily, bland, cheap vegetables)"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing choice of yummy and cheap food,positive,50,16-Dec-15,"I never go to Singapore without going to Newton Hawker Center. If you haven't ever been to a Food/Hawker center in Singapore, Do it!!! It's the cheapest way to eat while in Singapore. I've been to a few hawker centers around Singapore and this one is the biggest and best I've been to. There are tables and chairs set up in the center, they are surrounded by loads of food stalls selling a variety of Malaysian, Indo, Chinese food. Each stall sells something specific, some serve drinks, some don't. Find a table first, place a packet of tissues on the table to 'hold' it (or have someone sit there and mind the table), take note of the table number, then go in search for food of your choice. Some stalls will ask for your table number and bring it over when ready, others may make you wait while they cook it. Must tries are; BBQ stingray, fried squid, satay skewers, Otah and cold bean curd. And of cause a large bottle of Tiger beer."
French,Paul,Worst service ever,negative,10,5-Dec-17,"I cannot give any comments on food and drinks, they simply never arrived. The inefficiency of Paul's waiter and service brigade is overwhelming. There are so many of them, but they are so poorly organized that you watch them running around and doing all but what you would expect them to do - serving customers in the best, friendliest and most efficient way possible. We only ordered coffee and smoothies but after 20 minutes we gave up and left. Considering the options there are in Singapore, we will prioritize those cafe's in the future treating us as customers."

Very very good dish and very tasty uni. The tuna cheeck grilled also good. One thing that they lack is no beef. Sake choice is small but very good. Overall, its a.must try."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very average,negative,30,16-Dec-17,Tried a few stalls and the food was very mediocre. Had the curried skate wings which were the best of the variety of items we ordered. Certainly not the Singapore hawker food of past. This is OK for a visit if you want to say you tried a hawker center but not a must visit.

I had the Filet which was excellent, and the only other thing on my plate was a huge pile of fries, which just did not seem appropriate."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Choose what locals eat,positive,40,30-Oct-15,"Take time to observe before you choose which stall you'll buy your food. If it's frequented by locals, chances are...the food is good. I ordered duck from this outer stall facing the parking lot. Quite unimpressive and only a few duck meat (contrary to what their pictures showed). "

Will be back.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,12-Nov-15,We have been here countless times and still the number one Japanese restaurant at least for me and my friends. They always serve the freshest sashimi and high quality sushi..... and not expensive at all!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Too much sauce with deep-fried items ,negative,30,22-Apr-18,"Went to the branch at Katong Square for the 1 for 1 ala carte buffet offer and was surprised at the stinginess of the cutlery, condiments (no ginger or wasabi on table), lack of plain water (1.80 for free flow hot tea/soft drink) and having to ask for more paper napkins. Ordering from the I - pad was a good idea as photos showed the items though some dishes didn't resemble the pictures eg. the fried asparagus, ebi, rolls inevitably came with a heavy slatherng of teriyaki or some other sauce, so salty and unnecessary that it spoilt the dishes!To be fair, the sashimi was fresh and tasty and the ramen with chicken quite tasty. Portions were appropriate small so diners could try more varieties. However the curry with rice was disappointing as the potatoes were not thoroughly cooked and we had to leave two pieces uneaten, such a waste of food. The pumpkin chawanmushi was unusual though rather too sweet. We wished there were more fresh salad choices as there seemed to be only the fried cabbage dish.Service was fine. Though busy, the wait staff were courteous and obliging.Verdict - only come if you can down endless plates of sashimi or bowls of ramen! Not a quality buffet but fairly priced with the one for one deal. "
French,Saveur,Understaffed and long wait,negative,20,24-Aug-18,"We waited at the entrance for quite a while despite reservations as there was only 1 staff in sight and she was keying in food orders with her back to us. Cannot serve wine on a public holiday eve as they only had 2 servers i.e. understaffed. The girl was new so she keeps forgetting her orders/instructions straight after our sentence finished. Through the long waiting time, we already saw 2 couples walking out. For $85, not worth the time and service, can get better somewhere else."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food - good prices,positive,50,03/24/13,"We were recommended this restaurant - went for yum cha, steamed dumplings were great, Peking duck pancakes yummy and fried prawn wontons great.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach in Dempsey is terrible!,negative,10,02/22/12,"We were group of 7-8 colleagues, who dine at this restaurant last night 21st Feb. We had the most ""horrific"" time when the bill was presented. The Manager who took the order had the tendency of making the customer to pay a fortunate for a food that is so common in singapore. we were recommended a set menu for 6-7, with about 10 dish (that no one on this planet) could finish or eat, and we ended up with a big bill and waste of lots of food. perhaps this restaurants does not appreciate the wastage of food, but one should never recommend to ""customers"" who are not singaporean or local a list of food that is so costly. we had to pay SGD1111 for 6 people! They even charged us for wet towels, and SGD6 for diet coke! What a rip off. Take my pick, i have lived in singapore for 3 years and this is the first time i have had a bad time in a seafood restaurant. And this will be the FIRST and the LAST time we will go there. The Manager of the restaurant was not helpful, he did not even explain how we ended up with such a big bill. The FOOD was normal and i am 100% sure i could have got better in another place for a less amount of money we had to pay. Take our advise, never go to this place, you will have a big hole in your pocket and a shock to your system."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Better value the bigger the appetite,positive,40,22-May-17,Good deal but a complicated system of ordering too often fails but the food is nice and if you choose well and estimate well it is a lot of food/ sushi and other normally expensive items for good value
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique Singapore Hawker Flavour,positive,50,1-Oct-12,"The diversity of the hawker ambient is unique. Price of the food is more expensive than a regular hawker, however the superb variety and food quality offered by the hawkers gave Newton a deserving and accliamed reputation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Peppered Crab, signature dish?",negative,30,11/18/14,"We had black peppered crab of which the black pepper was so overpowering that we could only feel the texture of the crab meat but not its freshness. The fried clams was only fried with black bean sauce which gave it a monotonous taste. Normally,clams are fried with black beans and chilies to give it some layering in the taste. However, the restaurant was still jammed packed with local families and expatriates. I think people go there for reminiscences on good time with families and friends more than for the taste of the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Not a Nice Experience,negative,10,5/12/2015,When we arrived we stood around to be seated and no one seemed very interested. We were put at a table at the entrance which was windy and unpleasant. The service was shocking. Our food was cold and not at all pleasant. Onto the bill they added extra costs for the peanuts that were on the table and 2 dollars each for paper serviettes. It really was a dreadful experience after having been recommended to us.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh but...,negative,30,11/6/2011,"The location on Dempsey Hill is a nice one, surrounded by greenery and opposite the Botanical Gardens. The place is huge and usually crowded, so do not expect a quiet dinner time. We had one of the private rooms and privacy is restricted to the visual partition of the rooms. We had 3 noisy groups surrounding us and the noise level was the same as if they had just partied in our room. The food is OK lah, the best dish served being the deep fried snapper with mango chilli sauce. The rest of the dishes was just good but nothing special. One last advise, stay with beer for your dinner, the wine list reads nice, the wine is neither stored properly, nor being served at the right temperature nor does the staff know what wine is."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Average,negative,30,2/7/2017,"Standards keep dropping .... as they loss many of their Chef....
Service also varies between peak and non peak hours."

you will enjoy mouthwatering indian menu"
French,Saveur,"Food was great, service okay, waiting time EXTREMELY BAD",negative,20,16-Apr-16,"My friends and I ordered the 3 course dinner set. After the starter, we waited at least 40mins before our mains came. The dessert took 20mins after main course. We were just glad that we weren't rushing for a movie. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who isn't prepared to wait."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Gastronomic experience,positive,40,2-Jul-18,"saved up this month to treat my family for a meal here. to be honest, i remembered the food to be better a few years back but it did not disappoint nonetheless. If you plan to visit waku ghin, i think its better not to have heavy/oily meals before hand."
French,Paul,French illusions,negative,20,21-Oct-13,"To be fair the pastries to go are good. However the restaurant food is poor and the price expensive. As others have said it is just not French food. We had the steak. It was the antithesis of a French steak. It was tough, skinny and stuck in the mouth. The accompanying potato was over cooked and did not seem freshly made. The deserts were varied. The creme brûlée was ok but burnt on top. The crepe with sugar was terrible. It was cold and pasted to the plate. i could not scrape most of it off. The chocolate waffle was the winner for the day no complaints there.The service was fair. The staff were pleasant and helpful once you got their attention. Little things such as refilling water could have been better but I have had much worse. The decor and setting is good and it is a shame that the standard of food does not match the ambience and price. Stick to the takeaway pastries."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent chat place,positive,40,8-Sep-15,"This time, we stuck to what Kailash Parbat is famous for: Chat - pani puri, bhel puri, dahi puri, chole bhatura, and to end malai kulfi - all very good. Delighted with the savouries, service could be better."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Place ok,negative,30,12-Sep-13,"Do not go L'Entrecote if you expect to eat a top quality meat.The starters they have are relatively good, we had the foie gras et pate de campagne.But what to say about the main course.Not the beef you would expect to get in a french restaurant.In addition to that the service is not the most friendly you could find."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum Buffet a good way to experiment.,positive,40,03/17/09,"Dim Sum @ Yum ChaHad a desire for some nice Dim Sum. Followed a recommendation and headed into the heart of China Town. A little hard to find, hidden away in the back streets between Smith and Temple Street, above a perfume shop.Had the DimSum Buffet at SD16.80++ per person. If you arent sure what you like, or want to try lots of different things, its a great idea. The waitresses bring round and offer you a variety of plates by hand or in a trolley, and you say yes or no. Because you pay a fixed price, it means you can try some new things without worrying about wasting money.Tip: the menu has a few categories of things that you order from your server, the rest is pot luck what is brought round. However, we found that if there was something on the general menu we particularly wanted, our server was happy to order it for us anyway.Left feeling very stuffed, and having tried some interesting things. We appeared to be the only non locals there, but that wasnt a problem in any way.(http://www.yumcha.com.sg/Contact.html)"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the most fantastic dining experience in Asia,positive,50,20-Feb-13,"Waku Ghin offers a 10-course degustation menu with a private chef to prepare each dish in front of you to delight your senses. The restaurant offers modern European-Japanese Cuisine with the finest ingredients. We have come here on many occasions and each time we have enjoyed the service and the food. The consistency in execution is to be well-commended.This time round we started the course with the Oysters, Royale with Ginger & Rice Vinegar and Gillardeau with Lemon.Followed by Waku Ghin's signature dish Marinated Botan Ebi with Sea Urchin & Oscietra Caviar. The varying textures combined with the balance of sweet, fresh & saltiness of the caviar was done to perfection. This dish makes me want to dine here again & again.We were then served the John Dory from New Zealand with Roasted Eggplant. This fish was slow cooked in a pan rather than a water bath to keep the fish's freshness. It was moist but still can smell a hint of Smokiness.The steamed Alaskan King Crab with Lemon Scented Extra Virgin Olive Oil was perfectly done. The Alaskan King Crab was placed on a bed of sea salt which water was poured to steam the crab. The result was a perfectly cooked Alaskan King Crab leg which was juicy and tender.We always enjoyed the Australian Abalone with Fregola & Tomato. The basil leaves & tomato was a perfect combination with the abalone which was cooked on a hot plate. The tanginess worked so well with the freshness of the abalone.This was followed by another decadent dish of Braised Canadian Lobster with White Miso. The lobster was cooked perfectly. You wouldn’t usually match lobster with white miso but it works beautifully since the white miso brings out the sweetness of the lobster.The main event was the Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Cape Grim Beef. Cooked medium rare, this fine piece of beef is juicy, very little fat but has enormous flavours. Even by itself it is packed full of flavour and when complemented with Tetsuya’s Wasabi Mustard it is a match made in heaven.Our Sampi Pasta dish was a special request we made. The pasta was cooked Al Dente and then covered in Scampi Oil. The Sampi Oil is made by the restaurant from grape seed oil (healthy!) and the reduction of many kilos of scampi heads and shells. It takes a lot of effort to make a very small amount and it smells and tastes Great!!!We finished the savoury dishes with our favourite tea Gyokuro served at 40C to clean the palate.The desserts at Waku Ghin have improved since we were there 1 year ago especially by bringing in the Spanish Dessert Chef from Santos. This time round our pre-dessert was Cold Soup of Strawberry with Lychee Granita & Coconut Ice-Cream. The extremely light pre-dessert was well balanced with the sourness of the strawberries, sweetness of the lychee and the coconut flavour.The Ghin Cheese Cake was light and airy. The cream consistency along with the lemon flavours was a great dessert which wasn’t too heavy.Our Finale was the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Vanilla Ice-Cream & Macadamias. The mousse was light & airy but still kept the decadent chocolate flavour.We even enjoyed the Petit Fours especially the Matcha Truffle & the Chocolate with Mandarin Cream. Spending SGD 400 per person is quite pricey but all worth it!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Thirsty,negative,20,21-Mar-17,We are thirsty after eating the food. No doubt it is delicious. The waiters also serve food very slow and avoid our eyes contact when we want to order more. What an experience for ala carte ordering buffet.

Food quality was good but they missed a few orders as the tablet ordering system keeps disconnecting & its not very user friendly."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't waste your time and money here,negative,10,5-Aug-16,"For the amount of money that I'm paying, I would have expected better quality than sakae sushi. Sake sashimi was not fresh enough, tako sashimi was served with head and mini tentacles (not with the usual big slices, which is a first for me). Grilled food were moderate but too salty. Garlic fried rice was fragrant but too oily. Salad was served with too much sesame dressing, the lettuce was dripping with dressing. The restaurant should get their portions right. The best dish here was the plain lettuce. I would not come here ever again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Terrible service, average food",negative,10,13-May-18,"Went with my family for mother's day meal. And it just ruined the night for us.Firstly, they only offered buffet and not ala carte, which we weren't keen in the first place but since it was a special day, we decided to go ahead.Secondly, the ipad ordering system went down, yet some orders went through (multiple times). So we had to turn away a few repeat orders. But many dishes still didn't arrive. When we asked for an update of what were outstanding about an hour into the meal, the shocking answer was that they couldn't tell and told us to reorder via hardcopy. Then they proceeded to mess up our hardcopy orders. Some items never arrived and even after asking them to check, we waited for 20 mins with no news and updates on our food. By then, all the tables around us had already left and we were still left waiting for our food 2.5 hours after entering the restaurant.We would not have been that upset if the service was not terrible. Some staff was just blur, and one was just plain rude. When we highlighted these issues to the manager, all we got was a feeble and weak explanation. She didnt seem to understand the frustration and kept thinking that the issue was that we had outstanding orders. Service experience aside, the food was not worth it as well. Am never ever going back to Shin Minori again."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long beach Authentic Pepper Crab,negative,30,5/4/2017,Went to Long Beach for Chili crab with a group of 6 friends. The food was good but despite our best efforts the language barrier worked as a disadvantage. We asked several times how many crabs we would get and never were able to understand the answer. Food came out very slowly and one dish at a time to be split between 6 of us. When the crab finally came it was maybe one to 2 crabs torn up in a very soupy stew. Very much wok for very little crab meat. Communication was never adequate and we were stuck entertaining our friends as per how the restaurant wanted to serve us. We had to ask several times for napkins. Not Singapore's best. No offer of bread or rice was ever made / to enjoy the gravy with. But the Tiger Beer women come by frequently.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Everyone should experience Waku Ghin at least once in their lifetime!,positive,50,20-Aug-18,"Bar none, one of the top 3 dining experiences I've had in my 4 decades of existence and I've been to the very best across the world.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Rush,negative,20,28-Jun-17,"the shop closes at 10pm, last order at 9.30pm. we made reservation for 8.15pm which is the earliest time slot possible for online booking so not left much time to really enjoy (we ordered the buffet btw, this is BEFORE they told us the last order time). everything was frantic and rushing to order as much as we could then at 9.45pm they started to shut down everything. Although they didn't tell us to leave but we got the idea. Its one of the worst experience we ever had in this type of restaurant. about half of the choices of sashimi has a bit of sour taste, might be due to exposed to room temperature for too long, all the cooked food was covered in MSG, u WILL get very thirsty and have to BUY more drinks even if u are having buffet (yes, it's pathetic, its supposed to be all u can eat but not all u can drink, even tea is not FOC). Do NOT come here no matter what."
French,Paul,Paul first timer,negative,30,8-Mar-15,"I came to this lovely pastries shop last November. This place is really happening back in my hometown Jakarta, so as a pastry lover i should give it a try. I tried peach danish, chocolate mousse, lemon meringue tart and mango tart. So sorry but for me, tiong bahru bakery's pastries are better than paul's but maybe it's just me and my common palate :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good service but food so-so,negative,30,20-Aug-17,"Guess the interesting thing about this place is that as the shop name denotes, you will have a Steak (done from rare to well done) and lots of fries as your main dish so no need to crack your brain trying to figure out what to order. They do have dessert and such. Service is fast and friendly."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome Lunch,positive,50,10/4/2018,"Had a wonderful Dim Sum lunch at Peach Blossom at marina mandarin hotel Food was Super & tasty especially the Live Lobster with Cheese & wasabi Prawn.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","An average experience, food is good ",negative,30,19-Jul-17,"We went to KP, Little India, Singapore, as we were missing biriyani a lot! We arrived early to avoid waiting. We managed to slip in n get the last available table. The place was really narrow n linear, n cramped up, hesitantly rundown too.. It was extremely noisy, the place was definitely understaffed. The staff was running around, why n where is difficult to comment as public seated on each table was looking disgusted, unattended n disappointed. The food really arrived late, it was delivered to three of us at three different timelines. Food was good with KP standards, die to which I'm giving it 3 stars. Get in here only if you are looking for food 'on the go'. Avoid it completely if you're looking for fine dines or special evenings! "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton has changed slightly,positive,40,5-Jul-10,"I just came back from Singapore again on a work trip, as usual the local colleagues brought me to Newton Food Centre on my final night there. I dreaded it a little because in previous visits, I always get swarmed by hawkers who are all selling the same dishes, BBQ Seafood, and then some.This time, things have changed. Shops between No. 56-66 give you a less stressful dining experience there. The drinks store owner told me the current talking point is this store No. 64 that sells nasi lemak, or coconut milk rice, a local favourite for breakfast lunch dinner and supper. Turns out, the owner is a fine young lad who's a Masters' holder, used to be a GM of some MNC and drived a Merc SLK Convertible. Gave it all up to follow his hobby and passion.I do not know about you, but to give up an SLK Convertible, damn this guy is insane. Well, the nasi lemak i had was very pleasant. It was rather light, and had many interesting dishes to go with the rice, curry chicken, curry pork, and some peranakan dishes as well. It was a fulfilling meal together with the other favourites like fried prawn noodles and carrot cake. I have to say, if you do visit singapore and go to newton, do visit the row of shops i mentioned, No. 56-66. Very enjoyable, and you get a fine young lad serving you nasi lemak, THAT was the highlight of my recent trip, to Singapore, and to Newton Food Centre"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tourist place, similar menus, ok price",negative,20,7-Aug-18,"The menus and stalls all selling the same items, more or less. Seafood, satay, grilled stuff, prawn mee, carrot cake. there are some other options but quite few. Food can be expensive and can be similar depending on items. Quality and taste not really good and don't really think it's a good show of all the food in SG. Good place to hang out with friends."

French,Paul,Afternoon tea break ,negative,20,3-Jun-17,"Was looking for a rest point in the middle of my shopping and came to Paul's at Ngee Ann City. The tarts was marvellous, we ordered the lemon, raspberry and chocolate flavoured. The lemon tart is slightly sweet with a tangy sourish after taste and was the first to be gobbled up by my kids. Next was the custardy raspberry tart, the custard filling was just right and not too sweet with a generous serving of raspberries on TOP. The Chocolaterie tart was quite thick but good. The cappuccino however was a tad too milky, can't really taste the coffee. The ice lemon tea was ok and nothing much to rave about. The food overall was good with. 3.5/5 stars but the disappointment was the lack of service. Every order we had, the food came without cutlery. The drinks took forever to arrive including a bottled drink which we felt doesn't take much effort to prepare. We ordered a serving of fries and the request for The ketchup did not even arrive even after we have finished. I would recommend a take away cos the place doesn't deserved charging its customers for any service charge. "

French,Saveur,Saveur at The Cathay,negative,20,13-Dec-16,Service was really bad and they charge for plain water at $0.30 per cup. Tried the duck confit -- good value for money but it looks like the restaurant was severely understaffed on a Thurs night.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A good place to go,negative,30,12-Oct-16,Always a decent food court. Never disappointed and the food is always acceptable. The chili crab is 1/3 the price of Jumbo Restaurant and I think it tastes much better when eaten with fried ManTo.
French,Paul,"Food is less than average, coffee is just milk",negative,10,25-Aug-15,"I came for lunch a few years back when it just opened amd the food and service were really good. So we decided to go again this time, unfortunately it was not the same anymore. We ordered the pie, salad and chicken leg. The pie was cold and dry amd tasteless, unlike any pie i've ever eaten that are warm and runny inside. The so called nicoise salad was very dissapointing, the tuna was so overcooked that it becomes so dry and again tasteless. The chicken leg was not that bad the first few bites, but once you ate the outer skin, the meat on the inside was again, tasteless. I ordered cappucino which only taste like nothing but milk, couldn't even taste a little bit of coffee in there. Did I mention the guy who serve us was either on the verge of dying or he completely hates his life? When we ask for water he sort of sigh and glare then slowly walk away. Too bad, i used to really like this place now its just like a fast food fancy restaurant, the food came out less than 10 mins after we ordered btw."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,good food. poor service,negative,30,3/2/2014,"We just ate at Crystal Jade Holland Viilage (we have come here many times). This time we found the service to he horrible. We ordered egg tarts. They indicated that they no longer sell these. Instead we had to go to the Crstal Jade takeaway ourselves and bring to the table. When our food came, one dish was not what we intended. The waitress was quickly pointed out that we had disordered and forced us to take this dish rather what we wanted. Very disappointing."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown Gem,positive,40,02/18/15,"For those who are unsure about eating off the hawker street stalls, Yum Cha is a gem in the middle of Chinatown. We tried the afternoon Dimsum Buffet and left completely satisfied. The staff were polite and helpful as we explored the unfamiliar menu and ordering routine. Going in a group of four meant that we were able to sample a broad range of what was on offer with no left overs - note that the restaurant has an excellent policy for the buffet of charging for wasteage. The key to the buffet is to order little and often to make sure that your eyes don't exceed you stomach! The dimsum arrived freshly prepared and with little delay. We would advise others to arrive earlier in the afternoon - we came at 16.30 which left us a little tight for the 17.30 ordering curfew - and take your time to enjoy the buffet to its full extent. Do leave enough space for the excellent deserts we especially enjoyed the custard tarts and mango pudding though the almond tea was a pleasant surprise. For non fish eaters - avoid the steamed white carrot cake - it's VERY fishy. The lavender and coconut steamed balls would also be better saved for desert. If you are not hearty eaters then consider ordering a la carte as the reasonable prices may be better value than the buffet. We found the restaurant to be well signposted despite the extra street activity of Chinese new year - signage was clear if you looked up while walking along!"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Yum Yum for Freshness,positive,50,3-May-14,"I don't like its location, walking past the Casino to get to the restaurant didn't do that much for me, casinos aren't my thing. The restaurant is designed so that you get to sit at a counter in one of about half dozen rooms that seats probably up to about 12 people, which is nice and intimate, watching the food being cooked in front of you, I love that. Food was presented to you in its unprepared state and you were told about its origin. Each dish once cooked and served came with a full explanation of the ingredients. The freshness of the food was outstanding. Each dish was presented in such away that your taste buds were screaming out Yum Yum. For dessert you were escorted to a table that overlooked the city which was gorgeous and got to see an amazing light show, very spectacular. I loved every dish that was served to me, flavours were amazing, especially the Ohmi Wagyu, that was just delicious. You are definitely paying for the incredibly fresh ingredients, but the wine was way too expensive, over the top. Would I go back......maybe, maybe not. Service was excellent, but I would expect nothing less for the price. For similar price I personally would always return to the Tippling Club though. That's my favourite."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Pretty decent,positive,40,26-Oct-15,"We absolutely loved whatever we ordered here. We ordered a Sev Puri, a Kofta and Cheese Naan and everything was pretty tasty and served promptly. The place was bustling with people and so a tad noisy but food was quite alright. The chef was also careful enough when we ordered Chhole Bhatture, he came in and said, sorry but the Chhole haven't turned out good tonight so its better we order something else. I appreciate that humane honesty a lot. For Indians seeking veg food or chaat in Singapore, this is the place to go! :)"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Our Favourite Dim Sum Place in China Town - Breakfast,positive,40,06/28/16,"No Doubt you can find many other dim sum restaurants in Singapore, but at the end of the day, we always come back to this one ! Mid-low price range, air-conditioned, no queue (if you can be there earlier or make reservation for bigger group, we always visit there on Sunday 9.30am - NO QUEUE)We love it because the food is good and the ambience is very Oriental. They serve dim sum on different push-carts during the weekend. A casual eateries located in the middle of ChinaTown. If you are visiting China Town this is one of the must-go (we always bring our visitors here and they loved it). 2 Person spent around $30 for dim sum brunch. (not bad)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Home FOOD Away from HOME,positive,50,27-Jun-13,Kailash Parvat is a home kitchen away from home for all those Indian travellers who can adjust anything but cannot compromise on food.The best place to dine in 3 times a day to have a tastier experience.The whole staff ambience and food qualtiy is excellent.The taste is much much better than many restaurants in even India.I dont think one should try different places if staying long Infact u must repeatedly have all ur food requirement from here only leaving your fooding tension on Kailash Parvat .
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Buzzing atmosphere,positive,50,4-Dec-14,"We made a point of returning to this location because we love the night atmosphere and buzz of activity. This is an open air market with many eating stalls and tables ands chairs in the middle. there is something food wise for all tastes, even a vegetarian like myself. The prices are so cheap, it's crazy. No need to worry about the standard of the food, all good. Just a short train ride to get there. Everyone should experience this once while in singapore"

If u want to give a birthday party than the main branch on the main road is also very nice they have a sweet shop inside . In alla nice treat"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste of India in Singapore! Good food!!,positive,50,8-Nov-17,"It was a solace to have found one of my favorite eateries in Singapore. It is conveniently located along the famous Little India - Belilios Road. We had the delicious Pav Bhaji, taste of which transported us to the famous khao-gallis of Mumbai. Recommendations - Pav Bhaji, Paneer Sabzi, Masala Dosa. I did have one concern, they do not provide fresh pickle tubs, they will simply pass over a pickle tub used from another table. Staff also need to wear smiles on their faces. When we placed our order the waiter was behaving as if he was doing us all a big favor. Please note that most of the food served here is not fresh, it's pre-prepared and continued."
French,Saveur,Great Service!,positive,40,28-Apr-16,"Last week we were celebrating my friend's birthday at Saveur and we had a great time there. The foods are delicious with reasonable price. I requested to put some wording on the dessert in order to give a surprise to my friend. The staff helped me to do so and, on top of that, they lighted up a candle for us as well. Really appreciate that. We will definitely revisit the restaurant again. Thank you."

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A long long way to go for dinner.,negative,30,17-May-14,"Restaurant Waku Ghin , Number 7 on the list of Asia`s best restaurants , Number 50 in the World 2014 and the Singapore base of Japanese chef Tetsuya Wakuda, a bit of a shining star of Japanese cuisine and media. The only reason I went to Singapore was to eat here so i was expecting big things and to be honest the `Meal of a lifetime`.The restaurant is situated within Singapore`s Marina Bay Sands hotel which nowadays is the country`s most identifiable landmark…..think of Singapore and you immediately connect with the triple towers and the swimming pool table top. The cost of this complex was “8 Billion” Singapore dollars. The restaurant itself is a bit of a strange place to get to so allow plenty of time if you`re going. Its on the first floor above the huge casino. I tried to get in via the casino but was politely turned away as i didn`t have my passport. I was sent through the exclusive shopping mall , up a lift and onto a totally deserted floor where i had to scout around before spotting the Waku Ghin restaurant sign.When i arrived i was the only diner in the restaurant. It got a little busier throughout the evening but generally i found the atmoshpere to be a bit awkward. No music…only silence. Waku Ghin ( Spring forth and Arise / Silver ) interior is split into various small rooms, each containing a set of seats and a counter housing an immaculate griddle. The restaurant where i was dining only had 5 counter seats so that was 5 of us dining on the early sitting. The other two couples arrived shortly after i had been seated , both couples arrived and sat in silence.It was bloody awkward to say the least .I chose not to drink wine as the prices were bordering on plain silly so i went for a cold Tiger Beer at $16 (£7.60) and a bottle of mineral water at $20 (£9.50) Justify that if you can.I left the restaurant feeling as though i`d just been kicked squarely in my Gonads . I very rarely whinge about a meal as you`ll see from my many blog posts but on this occasion i felt very differently. My Bill came in at $ 513 dollars ( £244 ) with no wine. The Tasmanian Beef course was omitted from the menu.The Abalone was “portion controlled”. The fine flavoured Wagyu was overpowered by the fresh Wasabi.The signature Cheesecake never appeared and i was served a “slice of Melon”…….We live and learn. I had a relaxing stroll around the stunning Marina Bay , took aboard a few thoughts on my life and then went and spent $2 dollars on an amazing bowl of Chicken noodle soup and a stir fry in Chinatown……finally , the food hit the mark."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Over the top,negative,30,4-Aug-15,"I've heard that this type of ""ultra fine-dining"" is going out of fashion in Singapore. I must say after visiting Waku Ghin I can understand why. We expected the ten course menu to be decadent, but with such rich flavours heavy on protein we found it difficult to enjoy much past the 5th. This was largely due to the pace the courses came out - we barely had time to finish our matched wine before the next glass was being poured. Perhaps we eat more slowly than the other diners, however we believe an experience like this is to be savored. There were some stand-out dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed, such as the sea urchin with prawn and caviar. The heavier dishes such as the lobster were not to our taste. Moving to a more intimate setting for desert was a nice touch. The $1500 bill at the end of the night was expected but was it ten times better than other meals we've had in Singapore? Probably not."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow- worth the visit,positive,50,18-Dec-15,"Must visit if u dig street food. Bestsingapore crabs, butter garlic prawns from MsTau at stall 70 and try the food from also stall 31."

French,Poulet,simply loving it. Nice roasted chicken.,positive,40,6-Sep-13,"Tried it without much expectation, just it turned out to be an ""eye-brown rising"" dish. we had the whole roasted chicken, it was so nice, the sauce wasnt too rich until you cant have a good taste of the chicken. It is a great combination between the sauce and the roasted chicken. We ordered tiramisu and the banana bread pudding. I will not say they arent nice, but i cant appreciate both of the dessert."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Delicious Indian Vegetarian Spread,positive,40,29-Nov-15,"Have visited many times and tried a variety of dishes. Some of my all times favourites here are Do Rukha Kumbh - stuffed grilled mushrooms, papdi chat and kulfi falooda. All chat items and curries are good; but rice items are a bit disappointing.

French,Paul,Not what I expect from this chain,negative,20,22-Apr-17,Having been to a Paul restaurant several times I thought I knew what I was getting but this experience has left me very disappointed.The service was very slow and we were first served flat Coke which we asked to be replaced. We then had an extra Coke added to our bill. One member of our party was served their main first and had finished by the time everyone else had received their meals. We chose to have a chocolate cake which has to be the worst chocolate cake I've ever ordered at a restaurant. So bad that we didn't finish it. Not to mention it was served upside down on a plate and we were given no cutlery to eat it with. We then had to wait a very long time for the sever to deal with our payment which seemed to take a long time after we had given over our credit card. Very disappointed and I now know I can't rely on this chain to offer good food and good service. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Different venue, same great food",positive,50,7/1/2014,We generally visit Long Beach at East Coast Seafood centre but thought that we would try a different outlet on this occasion. The venue is very interesting - an old army barracks. We sat on the verandah which was very pleasant. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed it very much indeed.

She was so committed and professional in giving guidance advice resulting in a memorable occasion for us. Despite she was on her annual leave, she was willing to spend time communicating with me to ensure things were carried out in meeting our needs. Thanks very much Vivian! Cheers!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Horrible service!,negative,10,27-Dec-16,"Given a previous good experience at L’Entrecote, I decided to visit this place again for a Christmas dinner with my friends. However, both the food and service were highly disappointing. I will not be returning to this restaurant again. Food: Fries were good, beef was okay. It was definitely a lot better during my previous visit. Service: Unacceptable and poor service. The entire meal was so rushed it was like we weren’t welcome. - Over an hour, 2 servers asked me 5 – 6 times on whether I was done with my salad (though my plate was not empty & I was still eating)- Bread basket was not empty, server asked if they could take it back as they ran out of baskets (restaurant was not full, and we were obviously not done)- Asked to clear plates though there were still fries on them and we were still eatingWe made excuses for them and even thought through the different scenarios in which this could possibly be acceptable but nothing can hold. - Attentive service: They could be said to be really attentive. I was even appreciative the first few times they had asked. But multiple times when we are obviously not done – that’s not providing attentive service- Meal time limit: Understand this happens at some restaurants. But if so, this should’ve been mentioned during reservation or at the beginning of the meal. Nothing was said- Full restaurant with a queue outside: Restaurant had empty tables, no queue outside- Making space for other dishes: The table had more than sufficient space or nothing else was coming - Taking too long for our meal: We were there from 7pm to 8.15pm. I would think it’s normal to take 1 – 3 hours for a meal at a nice restaurant? We were there for slightly over an hour – more than within acceptable limits if there are any Overall, this was very disappointing. The food and service level has declined significantly and I will not be back again. For a similar price range, you can definitely get better food and service elsewhere."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food standard but poor customer service,negative,30,20-Jun-16,"This is my second visit to Shin Minori so I've decided to pen down (type down?) my review. Generally the standard of japanese dishes are quite alright. I have to mention some of my favourite/ must-order. Their seafood salad, pumpkin chawanmushi, yakitori electively, sushi selectively as well and garlic fried rice are quite good. What I am unhappy about is their customer service and/or servers attitude. The servers especially a lady in particular typically throw the dish plates onto our table and without saying excuse me while I was tucking in my food over my plates. It happened everytime she serves. This is an ala-carte buffet so you do expect that alot. There was practically no smile on their faces and that include their supervisor/captain if you would call that. The ambience was quite alright but table arrangement was cramp. Price for a weekend lunch buffet is about $40+ inclusive of taxes. Well, I was lucky to be using some promotion so I paid much lesser than that. To conclude, I would say if you are nearby River Valley and craved for some japanese buffet food... Consider trying them, if not I personally would not visit again for the price and service you will be paying for. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Faultless,positive,50,1-Apr-17,From entry to exit the service were impeccable. One of the best dining experiences ever! Best dish was definitely their signature sea urchin dish! Price tag of over $500 per person means its definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Looking forward to trying out Tetsuya's in Sydney.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese Dim Sum,negative,30,04/30/17,"Variety of Chinese dim sum food to choose from, generally the taste is good however I feel that the food quality has slightly dropped over the years.They offer the trolley service where typically they will prepare popular dishes and wheel them around the dining area, where diners may choose to have as many plates from the trolley service (dish is priced as in the main menu, normally without discount). This might be a good idea if the crowd is large and your order might take awhile to come.Service has been generally good, however waiting time for the staff might be longer if there is a large crowd.Note:The lift has been noted to be spoilt for a long time, unaware if it has been fixed but do not take your chances if a member is not good with stairs. As noted by the other reviews."

French,Paul,Service could be better,negative,30,12-Sep-16,"I was at Paul @ Westgate with some friends. This was my second attempt to dine here. When I came here the first time, it was for a late lunch and the restaurant wasn't crowded. However, we couldn't manage to get the attention of the staff to place our order. After a while, we left and went to another place to have lunch. This time around, it also took us a while to get the staff's attention despite waving at them and raising our hands to get their attention. We ordered the all-day set. When I asked the staff if they serve hot beverages, she curtly said ""No"". I knew the set came with iced tea but I was hoping I could upgrade and pay a little more for a coffee because I know Paul does serve coffee. Unfortunately, the staff was only interested to taking the set order without any variations. Food was ok and portions were good given that it was a set meal. Unfortunately, I noticed that customers on other tables also had a hard time getting the staff's attention. I noticed that several reviewers here also commented on the service. Perhaps this is something Paul's management should take note of and work on improving its service so as to enhance the overall dining experience for its customers."
French,Paul,It was unexpectedly amazing. Great customer service,positive,40,17-Apr-18,Came over to Paul with my family for dinner. The beef burger was really good for its tender and juicy meat. We also ordered the new menu of the honey baked chicken thigh and seafood pasta. It was appetising and I thought it was great for their French restaurant to introduce these local dishes. Staff was friendly and we really enjoyed the meal. Would come back again!

French,Paul,Nice place but Service is terrible,negative,10,1-Oct-17,"I have frequenting Pauls since it opened. Each time, the service gets worse. Today, I asked for water 3 times and ended up getting it myself. 25 mins for a coffee (my wife's came after 15 mins - no idea why they were not served at same time) and 30 mins for a bread basket - an item that requires no cooking, but simply placing precooked items in a basket ! My patience with. Paul's has run out. Pity as the food and location are both good."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"Crowded, not bad in taste",negative,30,06/26/08,"Crowded, not bad in taste"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Bit costly,positive,40,26-Oct-17,A bit costlier. Alternate place if you are tired of South Indian food. Food was good. Had my first experience that waiter will not serve food unlike in India. Also the items you order will arrive at the same time. There will not be any time interval . they will place the order on the table and leave.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worth it with 1-for-1!,positive,40,28-Jul-17,Service was very efficient and fast. Liked how each order of the rice rolls came in pairs so we were able to try more variety. Salmon and swordfish sashimi were fresh and good and especially liked the Dragonfly and Crunchy Makis! Great dining experience and extremely value for money with the wide variety available (:

French,Angelina_MBS,Drinks and light dinner,positive,50,4-Sep-18,We walked from the Esplanade to MBS after attending a concert. The walk took us along the floating platform and the Helix bridge. Weather was good for walking. Decided to take a drink and light food at Angelina. We settled for a bottle of Italian pinot gris which was recommended by the captain. It was fruity and good with the food we ordered. We had a club sandwich and a Ceasar salad which were excellent. Service staff tried hard to provide good service. We enjoyed our drinks and food. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Terrible, food is crap",negative,10,12/4/2016,"Everything tasted terrible. You get better taste in any coffee shop. Some dishes were just weird - bitter, too salty... The only thing passable was prawns - which were boiled."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun and tasty,positive,40,18-May-14,"A friend of mine took me here when I last visited. The set up is fun - you can work your way around trying different dishes from different food stalls, or just chill out at by one stall. A few bottles of Tiger and you're away. Great atmosphere and a great thing to do for an evening during a visit to Singapore. These hawker stall areas are in a number of areas I think, it is just that this is the particular one I went to."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Quality Japanese Food At Decent Price,positive,40,7-Jul-16,"Good quality Japanese food at decent price. Great for those who loves quality Japanese food without much fuss. While the selection can definitely be improve on, there is enough variety to keep us going."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Probably the best Sushi in singapore but far from 3 starts in Tokyo,positive,40,29-Apr-12,"I had $450 SGD course and the food there is quite palatable. However, after tasting Star sushi places in Tokyo, I found the quality vs. price is not the best. You can go to good Sushi places and eat fatty tuna or Oh toro anywhere but you can find the real delicacy of sushi not necessarily from the material they use but how they cook the fish (with vinegar, sugar or sometimes steaming sea eel). Overall I guess I cant complain considering that everything has to be imported from Tsukiji and the price gets higher."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Verry good,positive,40,29-Dec-15,The taste was osome and chat is so good tea is also like indian taste nise place I visit here 2 time
French,Paul,Worst service,negative,10,1-May-17,"The service level is not what you would expect from Paul. The outlet at Takashimaya is great, but the staff at Paragon are inattentive, unhelpful and slow. What made my visit worse was that two of the staff started having a heated argument right inside the cafe, all the while ignoring me when I was trying to place my order. At least have the professionalism to have internal arguments at the back of house, not where it is in display to all the customers."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice place for seafoood,positive,40,05/27/14,Nice seafood and ambience. Try the pepper crab. The service was good and they even tried to remove the shells from the crabs for you even if the place was crowded.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome Birthday Dinner - Delicious Food & Top class service by Christine,positive,50,9/4/2016,"Came here for my birthday dinner with my family. Probably one of the best service I have ever received in S'pore. Very personalized by the service staff, Christine, who was so bubbly and cheerful throughout the entire night. Also big thanks to the other staff members, Terry, Bowie and Nobel who i understood played a huge supporting role in the preparation of the dishes. Most importantly, the food was amazing, and i think the highlight for me had to be the wasabi prawns, ying yang hor fun and the beef cubes. I was even pleasantly surprised by the calligraphy written next to the cake and Christine even rapped it out for us! Will definitely come here again in the future. Highly recommend this place!!"

French,Saveur,Great cooking with decent prices near orchard!,positive,50,20-Feb-14,"I was in Singapore recently for work and was asked to try out concetto. While it may look like the generic and very typical orchard fare, the food was far from it. The chefs hail from some of the best restaurants in the city like guy savoy, jaan and db. My brother and I tried the crab risotto, pork ravioli, mushroom risotto, and pistachio panna cotta. All for about sgd 58. The food was honest and just good cooking. A breath of fresh air."
French,Saveur,Canteen food for restaurant pricing...,negative,20,22-Jun-15,"I think there are only few restaurants in the world which I gave this title, but actually it reflects the true concept.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs need to be improved!,negative,30,11/4/2014,"Went there for both chilli and pepper crabs. Chilli crabs taste good but pepper crabs are disappointing! It is too oily and wet! Need to review this dish or it is losing customers to Jumbo! In fact, I brought a group of six last week to Jumbo instead of Long Beach!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Buffet!,positive,40,26-Jul-17,"Great Buffet! Recommended to try! Staff were polite, friendly and attended to our request promply. The atmosphere was good, just that the table was a little small as it couldn't fit all our foods. But luckily the staff clear off fast!

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Popularity well-earned,positive,50,8-Jul-17,Cute little piece of Paris in Singapore. Tried to find a small place for a somewhat romantic dinner and found it here. Food was good with not too expensive price tag. Service was friendly and exceptionally fast. Menu is short and simple so the kitchen is able to meet the demand. Hint: make a table reservation online especially on a weekend night - even if it was just an hour before your dining time.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dinner,negative,10,12-May-15,Food cold bland and not fresh. Not worth the money. Main course came before even 1/2 way through starter. Service way to quick

French,L_Angelus,"Cosy, elegant dining experience with top notch food",positive,50,19-Aug-15,"Went there for dinner after being recommended by my good friend who knows that i adore french food.Was recommended by the chef, Reynaldo, his signature foie gras salad, along with seabass and wagyu steak.The salad was very well prepared and well balanced and the mains were delicately prepared. Perhaps this represents being able to ""taste passion"".Could tell that the food were prepared with passion and skill.Paired it with a red wine recommended by the manager and it complemented the food very well.Recommend this place for a nice dinner with your date or with friends for a quality dinner along with a comfortable and classy atmosphere.Oh one more thing to add, the creme brulee was fantastic as well!"

French,Saveur,fancy impression and it stops there,negative,30,25-May-14,"It looks modern and minimalist. It gives you the impression that this restaurant is laid back but fancy at the same time. But unfortunately, it stops there.You will be welcomed by a hi-tech seating reservation outside. It's a tablet wherein you have to leave your name and contact and it's suppose to give you a call when your table is ready. We decided to just stay nearby (a few steps outside the resto) but 20mins have passed and we're still waiting. We see people just walk-in and they got their seats immediately. We decided to talk to the guy manning the counter and he's at a lost on what to say and just told us to wait for 10 more mins. We're getting impatient but most of the restos in Cathay are packed so we decided to stay. Eventually, the call came and we we're seated.The menu is small and concise which is a good thing. You will not be overwhelmed with choices. The food is great. The portions/serving are neither here nor there. The service staff are a complete let down.Am I going back to this place? I really cannot decide but I'm inclined not to."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best Japanese food,positive,50,28-Mar-14,"If you are looking for delicious food - waku ghin is the one! I have a feeling it's the type of food that would hardly even be the subject of debate as I enjoyed almost every bite through each of the courses. While the price levels are admittedly too high for me, would not mind eating there again for a very special occasion. Excellent job to whoever is behind Waku Ghin. Keep it up!!!"

And the never ending supply of beautifully cooked chips was very welcome, as they were so good also. A favourite restaurant of my Son who eats there regularly and I could really understand why on this evening's evidence. Yes, I can agree that there is little to commend the restaurant interior. If atmosphere is your priority then Les Bouchons is probably not for you but if you are looking for, possibly, the best steak in Singapore then you have to try Les Bouchons Rive Gauche (if you'll pardon my french!)."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Chat... Good Bhatura,positive,50,5-Jan-12,"The chat quality is very good. Should try the Chat Palette !! I like the way they serve the Pani Poori, however the filling is mostly potatoes. They have a variety of Bhatura - avoid Cheese one. Rest are okay, if you don't mind the oily ones. They also have some Rajdhani lotus stem based ones. I liked them. Good spread and worth the price.Better eat in house and not try to pack their breads to eat at home / beach."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Amazing 1 Michelin Star Sushi in Singapore,positive,50,29-Sep-16,"Located on the second level of the Raffles Hotel, Shinji sushi offered me an amazing authentic Japanese gourmet experience. I was there with my fiancee for a casual lunch. We ordered Hana (flower) set-lunch. The 9 pieces meal was definitely enough to fill your stomach. The chef prepared the freshest ingredients in front of us and he’d proportioned the size of the sushi rice so that you’d have the best experience without feeling either hungry or bloated at the end of the meal. We were really impressed by the gold flakes mocha dessert at the end."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chilly Crabs...!!,positive,40,05/21/14,Long Beach is located at Dempsey Hill which was previously the old British Army Barrack. This place is huge with many restaurants to choose from. I particularly like the Black Pepper Crab and Chilly Crab... This is somewhat an achievement for me as I don't usually take crab... :)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Authentic Japanese buffet,positive,40,6-Dec-16,"Warm and friendly greet from the manager. Like the tablet ordering and serving portion, so we don't have to waste food. The only thing is that some of the food take very long time to come, come after our 4th or 5th round of order (45 min).

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin Memeorable Meal,positive,40,3-Oct-14,"Perched above the Marina Bay Sands casino gaming tables is this small twent five seater restaurant Waku Ghin from chef Tetsuya Wakuda. Every diner will end up with there personal chef. If the sea urchin starter with prawn and caviar is on the menu then you are in for a treat, the canadian lobster was mouth watering, so was the abalone from Tasmania, the wagu beef was sublime. Waku Ghin is restauarnt that Tets always wanted where he can source the best produce from every corner of the world. Start with a martini, the beverage list is well curated, with a fine sake selection. This is a world class restaurant."

It’s in an interesting part of town and the atmosphere is genuinely good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and fries with great sauce :),positive,40,1-Nov-16,"Went today for lunch and really enjoyed it. Getting a second helping of steak and fries was a big bonus. The sauce was also great. I would ask for a better choice of wine by the glass for the lunch crowd tho. As a bottle at lunch is not the best idea for a productive afternoon. I could imagine it would get pretty cramped when busy as the tables are so close together that you have to move them to get to the bench seats. And even then anyone to large may be knocking over glasses!Would defo go back, as $35 for good steak frites is pretty reasonable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Attentive service and nice ambience ,positive,50,02/23/18,"We happened to dine here as Tak Po is closed down, and we enjoyed our lunch a lot. During CNY there are many ppl doing “lo hei” thus the restaurant is quite noisy. This is how new year supposed to be . Dim sum was serviced with trolleys, they approach the table very frequently and friendly enough to show and explain to us. You can see the restaurant signage from far. However it’s on the second floor thus it may be a bit tricky to find the entrance. I enjoyed the squid dumpling (I can’t remember the name , it’s black color dumpling ) the most You can inform the staff to remove the peanuts when it’s serviced at the beginning if you don’t need it.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pleasant dining at Shin Minori,positive,40,17-Dec-16,"Food taste great, but orders are missing. Check with waiters, they inform us that missing orders we have to re-order again. Price is acceptable also!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent ala carte buffet,positive,40,31-Mar-17,Went for alacarte buffet lunch. Food quality was decent. Sashimi was fresh. You order through an iPad so it's very convenient and no need to worry about bothering the wait staff excessively.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Tourist Trap,negative,30,14-May-13,"There are almost 100 diffent talls all selling much the same food. I was told that this was cheaper and a lot more local Singaporeans ran this up until a few years ago. The food is still good but beware of the prices. Ask price before you order or you will get ripped off. Our meal for three with prawns, BBQ Stingray and Chilli Crab was $128.00"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Combination of great food and hygiene,positive,50,16-Apr-14,The best veg indian restaurant in little india with a wide variety of food and a cozy ambience. The staff is suggestive and friendly. Great place to visit for chaats. They also the an impressive range of mocktails. Would surely visit again with friends and family in the next trip to Singapore.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive!,positive,50,13-Jul-15,"The entire experience was awesome, all the dishes were beautiful, using the best ingredients and pretty culinary skills. Quite pricey $400++ exclude drinks for 10 courses, but definitely worth!

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Best all-round south Indian food,positive,50,17-Jan-13,"These are best idlis ANYWHERE. The utthapams are also really good; and the masala dosa has superb masala. The service is, hmm, ""innovative"", and presentation (and dips) leave a lot to be desired: but the idli are truly superb."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Add a touch of personalized service and creativity please,positive,40,27-Jun-13,"At $500 (USD$400) for a 10 course degustation menu, the entire experience is expected to be comfortable and unforgettable. The relative high quality with the high price is a given. Therefore I am sorry that I was not that impressed with the dishes compared to other Michelin-star restaurants I have visited around the world. I wish that after repeating the same menu for almost three years there could be some innovations in presentation, some seasonalities of ingredients and some surprises in taste. And perhaps a more permanent chef since it is not realistic to expect the present of Mr Tetsuya. While I still enjoy the signature marinated Botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar and the Australia abalone with fregola and tomato, I have also discovered many attractive alternatives that offer equally great good outside the prestigious casino with genuine warm service. However, Waku Ghin is still a place to impress someone, given all the publicities the establishment had received."
French,Paul,Ok service,negative,30,22-Dec-17,"This place is being blasted for service. Not sure why, it's pretty normal to me. Nothing special for the drinks, but tolerable"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with 1 for 1,negative,30,27-Oct-16,"Was there for a 1 for 1 promotion with UOB credit card. Ambience was cozy with dim lightings and privacy from other diners assured with separators place between the tables. Overall portion between 2 pax is adequate without being overwhelming and all their maki rolls were really tasty. I would recommend the Pumpkin chawanmushi as well. However as they could be understaffed at the moment, getting their attention is quite challenging. "

Had been hoping to get the birthday free buffet but unfortunately, we were told we couldn't get it on public holidays. That wasn't stated in the birthday treat page. What's more, that day itself was my husband's birthday! All orders were done via an ipad — would have been nice to be able to key in special requests in there. They had the option to select but could not key in anything, so as good as not having."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","It’s a tourist attraction, not a foodie hawker center",negative,30,20-Jan-12,"As a native, I wouldn’t say this is the best hawker center around. There are only a handful of good food stalls there but most are average. What makes this hawker center unattractive is the prices. Because it’s a “tourist” attraction, you get higher prices; basically it’s a tourist trap. Don’t be pressure by the touting hawkers. Find a seat and take your time to decide on what you feel like having."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Want a taste of Singapore?,positive,40,11-Jun-17,"This famous food centre has been around for many years but it is still able to retain its popularity with locals and tourists. There is a good variety of food , most of which are typically Singapore. Local food like satay, oyster omelet , several kinds of noodles ( wanton/roast pork, fishball, minced pork etc), seafood (famous chilli crab, stingray etc) was of a high standard . For thirst-quenching drinks the variety was also good , such as fresh sugar cane juice, fruit juices , local Tiger beer etc. The centre is easily accessible by public transport and is on the Newton MRT stop . The place consists of a covered part next to the stalls and a big middle uncovered part. If it rains , this can be a problem . All in all a very good place to savour the culinary delights of street ( and other ) foods of Singapore. "
French,Paul,Zero customer service,negative,10,23-Apr-16,Service staff need to be trained how to manage customers. 7 customers served by 3 staff - completely indifferent and rude. Had to walk out.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,I waited 30 mins for my steak!! Lousy service.,negative,20,21-Nov-14,I was at the Suntec branch on a friday evening. We were served our appetizer and had to wait 30mins!!! for our mains to arrive. The service was terrible due to they were full house and were shorthanded. The tables who arrived later than us were served their mains much earlier than us. They forgot about our orders. We had to keep asking them for our food. It was mad. I used to visit quite often but would like to avoid after this eventful day.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Same good quality. More seats,positive,50,10-Apr-17,"Oshino-san was in his element, whipping out seasonal highlights with his affable personality & adorable wife as chief waitress clad in a brand new kimono, apparently from material given by her mum. Food was as usual sublimely exquisite. More seating capacity also meant higher din when diners get excited in their conversations. Interesting place to people watch as well. From the corporate types to singularly focused Japanese connoisseur just content with the pleasure of eating fresh sashimi."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",OMG WAT A GEM PLACE TO EAT LOCAL,positive,50,15-Dec-13,Absolute a brilliant find that is easy from the MRT at Orchard and one stop away. you just need to follow the roundabout road to go over a walking fly over to reach it.Every trade stall holder was so astonished that you had arrived there and boost about their chef talents.. Best tasting fish ever!!! and in some case paid no more than the equivalent one pound for a meal.....
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Never disappoints!,positive,50,11-Apr-18,"I live very close to Kailash Parbat and we go here very often.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Loved it!,positive,40,3/10/2015,"We were in Singapore for a brief stopover, and had found details in guidebook. It was a little had to find, given all the stalls in Trengganu street. We were not sure we had the right place but several businessmen and other locals went past us in rapid succession, obviously intent on a quick lunch. We were seated quickly, in a sparsely decorated restaurant. The waitress was a little gruff, but attentive nonetheless and she warmed up over our lunch. Although she had little English, she pointed out an additional dish we may not have tried, the bean curd and shrimp dumplings. We ordered from the menu, and ordered a variety of dishes, including BBQ pork bun, chilled baby octopus in sesame, crispy wonton, steamed pork in garlic and chilli, prawn and wood ear fungus dumplings, and our favourite, mango prawn fritters with sesame. She also understood when we ordered just one small plate of fried carrot cake (3 pieces) between 6 of us, and offered to cut it in smaller portions so we could all satisfy our curiosity. We reordered three dishes because they were so good, but then we were struggling to finish it off. The almond tea was lovely, but some of our party ordered beer. We agreed it was the best yum cha we had eaten in 20 years. The bill came to around $30 singapore per head, but understand we ate a lot! Happy to recommend, but you really don't need to try the fried carrot cake. Everything else was excellent. "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Expensive, slow service, and poor quality of food",negative,10,30-Apr-17,"The price is overly pricey for the quality of food they serve. On top of that, even though it's a buffet, you got to wait for them to serve you. Waiting time for the dishes is very very long. For $40 per pax, it's really not worth your money and time visiting this place. This is an honest review. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Seriously!!!!,negative,30,17-Mar-15,"Was the experience relatively enjoyable? Yes. Was it worth $800 per person?No. Adjectives that come to mind. Pretentious & deceitful. Pretentious I was expecting. Deceitful not so much. On arrival we were offered Dom champagne in a gestural manner that implied it was on the house! The bottle was already open! It then appeared on the bill as a $550.000 open alcohol item! You would be right to think that our asking would be a sensible thing to do - but the feeling is 'if you have to ask, you shouldn't be there'. Any way, my advice: If your being shouted - go.If you feel the need to be showy - go If spending $1600 per couple on dinner is chum change - goYou are a major foodie - go If you do not fit into the above - don't go."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French Farce !,negative,10,29-Apr-15,"Having eaten at entrecôte in Paris and london this place is a complete shambles. Whilst waiting for a steak meal it is customary in France to receive a bread basket. When one dos not appear we questioned this and the response came ""it's only given on request "" The green salad has an awful citric dressing unlike the beautiful creamy vinaigrette in France and london. Then came the steak with an inadequate sizzle of the famous house sauce. We asked for more and were told we would be charged 3 dollars for it. (Despite a bill of over 100 dollars for two )Then came the profiteroles. A usually delicious and indulgent dessert ... Again this came with a pitiful dribble of choclate sauce on it. Needless to say we did not ask for some more sauce this time ! The whole experience was soulless and petty. We felt we were part of their profit making mathematical sum. No passion. Just a mere business. If it hurst them so much to bring out the food, I suggest they put their mathematical skills in another line of business"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood haven,positive,40,22-May-13,Just be careful - always ask for prices first before ordering!! We spent quite a hefty bill normally spent on 5* restaurant.. But the food was absolutely delicious
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's not that great!,negative,30,30-Jun-11,"This is a place for the tourists, the locals hardly patronise this area, as the food is more expensive than those served at the neighbourhood food centres. Furthermore, the food is not necessarily more delicious."
French,Paul,Great dessert place ,positive,40,25-Jul-16,"The eclairs never fail to deliver but we decided to try something different. Check out the waffles, chicly decorated and tasted great too. Always a great dessert place!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum Dinner,negative,30,12/19/17,"We ordered Scallop Congee, shark fin soup, char siew bun, prawn dumpling, deep fried prawn in the tofu skin and two desserts. The congee was not good, shark fin..so so. We waited for about 35mins before we are being served. Prices are a bit overpriced and the quality of food has gone down. Maybe we will try out another branch."
French,L_Angelus,Disappointing for lunch,negative,20,3-Jul-18,Shockingly slow service for the set menu. Inexplicable. The food was half decent provided you could wait an hour for it to arrive. Many better places....
French,Angelina_MBS,A Little Paris in Singapore,positive,40,16-Jun-15,"When I vacationed in Paris back in 2014, I stayed near an Angelina Paris Patisserie but never got a chance to dine in because of its queue. Now that we have one at the newly revamped Capitol Piazza, I jumped at the opportunity to check out its goods and validate its reputation.We were lucky to be the only ones in the queue on a Sunday afternoon. We also chanced upon an empty table by the sidewalk. The circular table was petite, to say the least and hardly meant for large meals. Luckily, a rectangular side table was put to good use. Water was served without us having to ask. The menu showcased their cakes, each piece literally a work of art; and also offered other dishes for a fuller and more complete meal.We ordered the signature Le Mont-Blanc (which solidified Angelina Paris' reputation ever since 1903) and the Tentation. As with all cakes, they were sweet and looked temptingly pretty. In fact, it took me all of 15 minutes before I decided to take a bite as I sat there admiring their designs.Service was good but not fantastic as they had to contend with the crowd, ever streaming in but not overwhelming so. At the end, its prices were not unexpected, but to experience a little Paris in Singapore, why not?"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth the money,negative,20,2-Apr-17,"Went there with birthday 1for1 promo. Since it's ala-cart buffet, we need to wait till they serve us our order. Table was too small, orders came in quite slow, plates were not cleared until we asked them to. The food quality was not bad, but it's only worth it because it's 1-for-1. for full price $44, will never go back again. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Good place to rest,negative,20,24-Aug-16,"If you are tired of walking around, then you can go in to this restraurant and rest for awhile in Aircon. Simply because the order takes more than 20 minutes to be delivered.
Its self service, you must pay at the counter first and then...More"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very poor service,negative,20,1-Feb-17,Utterly disappointed with the restaurant that was branded to be the best buffet restaurant in 2016. Very poor services by the waitresses with rude expressions.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),great experience and celebration!,positive,40,09/24/16,"we had a sumptuous seafood dinner to celebrate our clinic's anniversary at a quiet corner of the restaurant. Food was beautifully presented especially the lobster salad in dragonfruit and the pumpkin puree dessert. Terry, Alicia and Christine were friendly and made the celebration a memorable one."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing,negative,20,16-Dec-17,"This was not my first visit but i was greatly disappointed with the poor service and poor quality of food. The tuna sashimi did not have any taste, the grilled dishes we had, were bad. The quail eggs had a plastic texture, the chicken liver were hard and dry, the chicken skin was just hard and has a burnt smell. The service staff simply placed the plates at the corner of the table, despite space in the middle of table. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",busy but food was disappointing ,negative,20,28-Dec-17," i was looking forward to taking my wife to a hawker centre to try some great food including the chilli crab, now it is only a hawker centre but my previous experience in singapore is that they have been very good , I checked this place out on trip adviser and took the MRT to get there. Arrived , all good , busy and a good vibe however the food was not good in fact it was far from good . perhaps we were unlucky with our choice . However i would suggest that unless you have been recommended a place at the centre, really don’t care or happy to just risk it i would think carefully about this centre - there are other choices .If you decide to go i hope that you have a better food experience. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Small little Dim Sum place that's value for money!,positive,40,9/8/2014,"I heard quite a lot about this restaurant and always wanted to try it but didn't have the chance until very recently.Yum Cha, literally means, 'Drink Tea' in Chinese also means to having Chinese tea and dim sum. Dim Sum, small Chinese dishes. Think of it like servings of individual bites, in small portions.The location of the restaurant, in the middle of Singapore's Chinatown, adds to the allure of this place.The Dim Sum were had are surprisingly good, the portions just nice. Yum Cha does not skim on the ingredients and we could find whole pieces of shrimps, for example, in our Har Kow (Prawn Dumplings) and Prawn Chee Cheong Fun (Steamed Prawns in Rice Rolls). The fried carrot cake was very crispy and still soft to bite. Overall, I like the food and the price.However, the only dish I find not well done was the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun which I felt had too much oil and not enough of the light soy sauce.It is a very popular restaurant and do expect to queue for a while if you are going during the busy times of lunch and dinner."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent buffet,positive,40,8-May-17,Very good variety of food and good quality. Food was delicious as always and good sake recommendation by the female manager.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Standard Dropped!!!!!!Horrible Food....,negative,10,4/3/2012,"It was last Saturday night at around 11pm , we were a group 12 people. We ordered sizzling beancurd which was prepared differently from the usual style. The cereal prawns were stale. The steam fish was served overwhelmingly with garlic.We also ordered pepper crab, keow teow and 2 other dishes. For desserts we ordered pudding which tasted very ordinary. Overall, it was a bad experience and will not return to Long Beach which was our favorite seafood restaurant earlier. The quality and standard dropped drastically. Very disappointing...."

Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Authentic sounth-indian food,positive,40,25-Jan-12,"If you miss home food, murugan idli shop will set it right for you :-). The food is great, the dosas are just the way they make them in chennai. Spicy curry with Idlis, yum! The Mysore dosa is worth trying."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Crab,positive,50,2-Feb-14,Fantastic place to dine along with locals. There are several shops with the similar menu. Chilli crab is very tasty. Bargaining is essential especially for crab dishes. Bill for 2 with drinks ~50SGD
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic food and great experience,positive,50,9-Jan-16,"We went to this hawkers' market and were delighted with the food. We were helped by the man at the A1 food stall who organised for a table in the middle to be cleared for us. He then explained how things work there and ordered drinks for us. We ordered our meal from him and he brought us the most delicious noodles, chilli crab and garlic prawns all for $75 for 2 people. He brought us a large finger bowl as the crab is messy to eat and then when we finished he brought over some wet wipes. There's a great atmosphere there with about 80 stalls to choose from. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),A personal touch to a birthday celebration,positive,50,9/3/2017,"Our family of 11 went to the Peach Blossom at Marina Mandarin recently to celebrate my birthday. I want to thank each of its staff for making it a truly memorable one, especially Nobel, Terry, Sun Jing, Christine and Vivian. Their service was truly commendable. Terry wowed us with his Chinese calligraphy on birthday wishes on the birthday cake. The food was wonderful, as was the ambience. Kudos to the team once again!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eeeks!,negative,20,7-Feb-12,"This place is known for being bad service, overrated, dishonest.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Indian Food in Little India,positive,40,30-Jul-15,"We enjoyed the quality of food, the ambience and the friendly attitude of staff. The menu list is large and the quantities served are adequate."
French,Angelina_MBS,Lovely place,positive,40,5-Jun-16,"The place is small but I quite like the Parisian feel, although typically in Paris or Europe, the tables seem more far apart, which gives you more privacy. I'm not sure. We had the brunch set. The coffee was alright, hot chocolate was pretty good but a little rich, pastries were good but rather common. The smoked salmon was alright and the half boiled eggs were fun to eat it from the tiny egg holders. The french toast with caramel sauce was a little too much of carbo for me but you could choose the other which I can't remember what it is. Overall, it was an enjoyable brunch, but I prefer somewhere else if it's only for the food. There are better brunch/breakfast elsewhere. I will still consider returning to try their main courses next time. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Japanese to die for!!,positive,50,17-May-15,"Shinji by Kanesake, tucked away in a quite corner of Raffles Hotel and best loved hotel. Singapore has plenty of Japanese restaurants right from the chains such as Sushi Tei to the celebrity chefs. Shinji falls in the highest category when it comes to Omakase restaurants in Singapore, it is located in the colonial Raffles Hotel and is set up in traditional Japanese style with tables by the sushi counter and then some private rooms. An omakase menu is featured and skillfully executed by a native Japanese team of artisan chef's. They have 3 or 4 set menus that one can choose from, most have a similar base of dishes with some add-ons. The chef asked us whether we wanted a selection of sashimi and sushi or just sushi. We opted for a combination.We were treated to yellow fin tuna, needle fish, sea urchins in sashimi and then blue-fin tuna, spanish mackerel and horse mackerel, my personal favourite was Sword fish.For desserts we were served the musk melon with salted ice-cream. And that was a fantastic end to a great meal. All along, the service was great. Do note, as with most high end Japanese restaurants, this one too charges top dollar and is usually frequented for business dinners or special occasions."

Typical Japanese restaurant."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of seafood,positive,40,29-Jan-13,"If you're looking to experience a wide range of seafood, then Newton Hawker Centre is the place to go. So many stalls offering a great selection of seafood. The prawns and satays are definitely a must. I would recommend having a look around all the stalls before you decide what and where you want to get the food from. Be aware of people coming up to you asking if you need a table etc - once you say yes, they'll show you to a table then hang around getting you to order food with them. It got a little annoying after a while. You shouldn't really have trouble finding a table so it's probably easier to order the food yourself (just know your table number before you order food because generally the stall vendors will tell you they will bring the food to you). Overall it was a very enjoyable night and I definitely preferred Newton to Lau Pa Sat."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,If it's chilli crab you want...,negative,30,04/16/16,"..this is the place. I'm not a big fan of spicy food but the crab, fish and seafood we ate here was very tasty. Only downside is it's messy eating and lack of napkins so up and down to wash hands. Service was a little slow at times. Beer by the pitcher was good."
French,Paul,Not Good,negative,10,28-Oct-15,I ordered a simple sandwich and it was served to me looking old. The cheese was hard on the edges as if it had been sitting out for a few hours. I had to ask several times for the drink I ordered only coming after I was done eating. I expect more from. Pauls located in Singapore.

French,Paul,Excellent experience,positive,40,22-Aug-12,"Paul is on the 3rd floor of Ngee Ann building ( better known as the Takashimaya building) smack bang in the middle of Singapore's main shopping artery, Orchard Road. I just dropped in for a coffee and croissant and while the food was quite good, what really impressed me was the superb service. The lady who served me,Jennifer, was courteous to a fault, prompt and extremely efficient, qualities which are quite rare in the service industry in Singapore. She made my day, what more can I say!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Value for vegetarian food.,positive,40,17-Mar-17,"I absolutely love how the food is of great value and worth it. I patronize this restaurant almost every weekend. As a non-vegetarian, this has made me realize that vegetarian food can be excellent (I have been to many vegetarian restaurants that made me glad I was non vegetarian because of how bland the food is). Kailash Parbat was different and exceeds my expectations. I find myself returning here frequently. I especially love their Hyderabadi Briyani."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quite okay,positive,40,6/5/2017,"We tried the duck wanton noddle, black pepper bun, quarter duck, charsiew and other dimsum items. All was averagely okay, except for the YUMMY honey charsiew. The duck itself and black pepper bun was quite underwhelming but still nice nonetheless. Not a must return but still an option."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best supper during my stay in Singapore,positive,50,1-Mar-18,"I made an online reservation prior to my visit to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday in Singapore. We ordered the Giant “Cote de Boeuf” (Prime Rib) 1Kg, one of the ""specials of the house,"" which came with a bowl of salad, bread, and free flow of french fries. The prime rib cooked medium both looked and tasted so good we couldn't stop eating! At the end of the meal, we ordered a chocolate cake, which came on a nicely decorated plate with a message ""happy birthday"" (I asked them if they could do a little surprise on our dessert plate through email when I made the reservation!). The staffs were friendly and generous throughout our stay and undoubtedly nice enough to celebrate and take pictures of us for my boyfriend's birthday. They definitely succeeded at making us walk out of the restaurant with our stomachs full, hearts warm, and lots of smiles! Access is also great as it's located along the river, so you can take a nice 15-minute walk to Clark Quay station. Again, thank you so much for everything. Will definitely come back again (from Japan!):)"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Convenient location, food tasty, service ok",negative,30,05/21/13,"We couldn't reserve a table with the competitor as they were full (on a Monday night) however this restaurant was recomemded to us and they weren't full, maybe 50% full. The pepper crab, spinach and tri egg dish, seafood noodle were all very tasty and the price was reasonable. However the service was pushy when taking our order and then at times slow when we needed more tea and napkins for the messy (but delicious) crab. I felt more like we were in a process to be fed rather than out for casual / relaxed meal with friends. I would return as the food was good but I'd be firmer with the staff to ensure we weren't ""proccesed"" but rather served and indulged. "

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Salty egg crab ,positive,50,21-Nov-15,I have tried several different chilli crab places and salty crab places - they all taste different. I was told on the first day by the store owners they are all the same taste. I have to recommend stall 19 for their salty egg crab. Mr and toddler loved it. We went back everyday of our stay in Singapore. Price is decent and a variety of dishes chilli or not.

The roasted meat - especially 'char Siew' is nice.Other dim sum not bad. Taste like most HK cruisine prepared by HK chefs. Place was crowded. Book early or queue early. Pro.icing reasonable. Sitting capacity limited."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big disappointment,negative,20,01/18/16,"I was looking forward to try the black pepper crab and chilli crab as it was recommended to definitely try in singapore. My boyfriend was looking on tripadvisor and we wanted to go to the main restaurant but there was no table, our concierge recommended another closer to the hotel, but same company, so we booked. First of all they wanted to sit us, at the washing area, looked horrible, smelled bad, obviously I told them Im not gonna sit there...The restaurant is not cheap, and I was ready to pay for excellent food, and restaurant, but not on plastic chairs, watching the dishwashers gumboots and the cleaning process during my dinner. Not to mention, we dressed up nicely. They asked us to wait, the lady was not really helpful, after 10min we got a nice table. I was ready to forget the bad start, but.. The staff was NOT kind at all, it was around 8:30 pm, felt like they want to go home so much, waiting for the shift to finish. Nobody spoke proper english, at least those who were in contact with us. The crab was ok, but nothing amasing. At the end we paid about 150 EUR for 2 pax ( dinner and drink). Did not worse the money"

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Disappointing,negative,20,13-Jun-11,"Over Priced, the food is super spicy and oily. Being an Indian, I thought the food was nowhere near authentic. Infact, they can call it their own innovative cuisine as nothing tasted actually Indian. There are far better Indian restaurants In Singapore.
Nothing much to...More"

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sides surpasses the mains,negative,30,25-Aug-18,"Designed to be quaint, it resembles any steakhouse in France during the 80s. The place is very compact, like our Europe counterpart, so if you suffer from claustrophobic, get those few tables that are lined opposite to the stretch of tables with benches.We were promptly served complimentary rose white wine, and subsequently our orders taken. We took foie gras terrine, extra salad and XL steak fries. The staff kindly notify us that XL steak fries do not get fries and sauce refills.The foie gras terrine was so good, so yummy, it was the deciding factor for us to come back to L'entrecote again. The salad was fresh, so were the walnuts that accompanied it. On a side note, the portion of the extra salad was very generous, much bigger than the salad that comes with the steak. Then comes the long awaited steak and fries. We ask the sauce to be on the side as I am not sure if i would like the sauce. Sure enough, my palette does not feel comfortable with the taste so i use it sparingly. We ordered medium rare for the steak, as we usually would. It tasted quite raw and chewy. It was not what i expected at all. I guess its a simple cut with a mediocre grade. However, those killer fries will definitely get you addicted, like it did for my diner. Fortunately we do not have free refills because the portion of the fries were sufficient to fill us up.I would come back again for the sides, not their steak."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Still Good,positive,40,1/5/2016,"Whenever we have a meal at Peach Blossoms, whether just 2 persons or a dinner event, the staff, Nobel, Bowie, Vivian, Jeff, Terry, Sook Teng are always patient with our requirements and changes, trying to accommodate our requests. They really put in a effort to ensure all is smooth during the dinner event.The food standard is still good, receiving good comments from friends with whom we had dinner with. Our son had soup and he said that it tasted like home cooked."

French,Poulet,Poulet at Bedok Mall,negative,20,21-Mar-14,"Poulet - the Amazing French Roast Chicken .... as the name suggests, this should be the place for chicken lovers..... but somehow, the taste, presentation etc suggest otherwise. Recently I went to the branch in Bedok Mall, and I order the latest signture dish which is half rosted chicken served in ""freshly home-made orange sauce"" with bacons and purple cabbage, and also ordered a garden vegetables...The moment the food arrive, found that the chicken seems ""hot"" and when tasted the sauce.... feel terrible.... the sauce is COLD... normally we would expect the sauce also comes in hot.... then mixing the chicken with the sauce is really a bad idea... On top of that, since it comes with ""bacons"" in the sauce we would expect also manage to eat the bacons..... but imagine in the whole plates, I only manage to find 1 bacon ..... and the size..... 2cm by 1cm... that is how TINY the bacon can be!!!! Paying such a price for this kind of dish ???Then comes the fresh garden vegetables..... and I would say it is so salty and the presentation really cannot make it... look at the pictures and you will know what I meant.The food was nowhere near French. The service was below average. I wouldn't recomment this to anyone. So far this is the worst western food that I've had in Singapore. that this would be a chicken lovers paradise... the menu suggests otherwise..... i found it quite demotivating actually.... we went to the Vivo City outlet and were quite let down with the service and the menu and the taste of the food on offer.... just did not appear to be any value for money..... there is nothing..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",5 years and NO menu changes,negative,10,24-Jan-16,"Since the past 5 years it's the 3rd time I have been invited to Waku Ghin.My first visite was definitely a 5 stars rating, the 2nd 3 and the 3rd deserved this terrible point.The first visit with this OMAKASE menu, (meaning for me that it's a daily preparation and chef Tetsuya will have a lot of creation and will follow the season), was good even if the portion were RIDICULOUSLY small and didn't deserved the SGD 400++, but what to do with this aspect of the Japanese cuisine...For my 2nd visit the menu was exactly the same, did chef Tetsuya built his reputation with 1 menu, with only 8courses?The answer on my last trip.... YES!!! SERIOUSLY.....Almost the same menu with the same display... But now the worst is the confidence and the arrogance of your teppan ""chef"" that assumed they don't have to do the job as the reputation is established in the 50best.SGD400++ and had a Macdo or food court because you are still hungry is absolutely a joke and a tourist trap for MBS."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food and lovely place,positive,50,7/1/2016,"We had dinner in this place in our second day in Singapore.

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sorry, this restaurant is over-rated",negative,30,31-May-15,"We REALLY wanted to love this Japanese restaurant. I mean it's rated 1 of the top restaurants in Asia! The service was lovely and attentive but for the price, there are so many other fantastic restaurant choices in Singapore that are more reasonably priced and the food is better. We ordered the 10 course menu with wine pairing. The ""signature"" dish was a marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar - and while it looked beautiful, I didn't like it. I think it was one of those dishes that you either love or hate. For such as spendy place, I wanted to eat food that really wow'ed me. The closest I got to ""wow"" was the wagyu roll with fresh wasabi (delicious) and the abalone with pasta. One of our waiters kept telling us this was a French restauratn - there is just no way! It is totally Japanese and I'm sorry to say that the food is over-rated."
French,Paul,Normal Fruit Tart,negative,30,26-Mar-17,"Its my first time trying the fruit tart at Paul and I expect myself to go hoo haa, raving on how buttery and tasty the fruit tart was.

Of course, the nicest part of the tart was just the fruits, fresh and sweet.Outlet: Westgate (not able to locate Paul Westgate on tripadvisor, thus posting the review here)"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a Hong Kong Style Cuisine,positive,40,05/28/17,"I was confused when I saw the signage. I was remembered of Heston's Fat Duck in London. In fact it's a Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong style. It has plenty menu, and I thinks it's quite alright."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Bigger place bigger problems...but food is still great,negative,30,29-Apr-18,"Food has never been an issue here, in fact its fabulous. At their prior smaller premise, Murugan struggled with proper systems in place and therefore service was a slight issue, and the size of the place kept issues under control. Now that they have moved...More"
French,Poulet,Can't call it French but I loved the food,positive,50,28-Jul-13,"Everytime I pass this nicely decorated restaurant, but their menu seems nothing attractive. The menu lacks proper pictures and description, but today I was determined to explore their food. So, I choose mushroom soup, Chicken and Fig In-between sandwich and iced lemonade. I was really not expecting anything amazing, but when I tested the food, I just loved it. I will certainly recommend this restaurant to everyone. I loved the food, service, restaurant decoration,atmosphere and above all their extremely reasonable price."
French,Poulet,Poulet Outlet at Chinatown Point,positive,40,5-Sep-13,The Oxtail De Bourguignon was tender and overall it was good. Portion is considered small even if you are a small eater.
French,L_Angelus,The Only French Restaurant in Singapore for us!,positive,50,3-Jun-17,"My daughter grew up in Switzerland near the French border and to her, there is nothing better than authentic French food. So to celebrate her graduation last night, out of all the restaurants in Singapore, L'Angelus was her choice. Never disappointing, simply great French food in a lovely fine dining atmosphere. And they now have a $68 three course menu that has a great selection. If we hadn't gone with our favorite menu items in mind we would have been tempted but we stayed with our favorites: duck liver pate, duck liver grilled and the Chicken Fricassee in a morel and truffle sauce (the recipe's on their website) which is to die for. For dessert, my daughter had her favorite hot chocolate cake with their luscious vanilla ice cream. One more thing, I'm on a low-carb diet (no sugar) and found the menu filled with possible options. But just to make sure, my waitress went to the kitchen and came back with a list of the best of all choices. An unbelievably gourmet meal which also didn't derail me off my diet? At L'Angelus, what's not to like?"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist trap,negative,10,17-Nov-12,"So many much better places to eat local food without the rudeness of the vendors,overpricing and often poor food quality.............Singapore hawker food can be brilliant but generally not here.This is where you go if you are using an outdated guidebook. Try Lau Pa Sat instead."
French,Saveur,Decent food at reasonable price,negative,30,10-Jun-14,"The menu is short and sweet.. there's a page of Pasta information, which is nice.. but what I don't understand why there is a choice of fresh and box pasta? Shouldn't you use fresh pasta all the time? if you're using box pasta, I think all of us can also make our own pasta dish at home. The dishes we ordered were bolognese and prawn aglio olio, both with fresh pasta. The bolognese was okay, I have had better, but the prawn aglio olio was delicious! I think it's an okay place if you're craving for some decent pasta.As for service, there's this one waitress who didn't smile at all.. There rest of them were quite friendly.. I would come back again to try other food there.."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Good place to dine...,positive,40,14-Nov-15,I have been visiting Riverwalk Tandoor for more than 10 years.... I have never been disappointed! Good quality is good and very consistent... Staff is very courteous and friendly.
French,Saveur,First time at Saveur,positive,40,1-Mar-17,"Went there last Sunday for the first time. So had many questions how the promotion works. Was talking to the junior staff, thus she said she will check and get back to me on the questions, which was fine. Was going to order the chicken then they mentioned that the chicken and steak were sold out yesterday. Was wondering how come they didn't stock up for today as well. Luckily I am fine to order the other choices.. but was hoping to try the chicken though. Pleasant experience there. Hope to go there again soon. Thank you. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nothing special,negative,30,12-Nov-13,"Just what they say, entrecotte and fries. Not specially good, neither bad. Service is better than food, what is actually strange in Singapore.
Only go if you really need to eat a steak and don't know any other better place... But there is a lot."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",disappointing,negative,20,20-Oct-12,Be very careful when ordering seafood of any kind as they price it by weight per 100 Grams. This can turn out very expensive if you do not insist on the cost beforehand. We have not been back since we took friends over 2 years ago. One the up side the FRESH juice outlets are excellent value.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Very good,positive,40,22-Dec-15,Had the lunch South Indian thali it was very tasty and packed with full flavours. The place is really buzzing lots of people.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Very good Indian Veg Quality Food Items,positive,40,14-May-13,"These people has so many branches in Singapore but the one which is infront of Mustafa is the best and biggest.
great quality and taste, little expensive but only very little :)
All sort of veg food options are there and taste will force you...More"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,How good!!,positive,40,06/24/17,Had a group dinner on the recommendation of a co-worker so wasn't sure what to expect but it came thru. The debate of chili vs black pepper crab continued on to the next day. (Both good but black pepper was outstanding in my view). Other menu items were very good as well so something for everyone. Service was attentive and everyone had a good time. Definitely worth the trip. 
French,Saveur,Centrally located Good Value-for-Money food,positive,40,13-Dec-17,"Good menu choicen of starters & mains... need to add a few more choices for desserts though but what is lacking in choices in this department is made up for by the beautifully tasting Caramel lava cake. The duck confit, pork belly & the squid ink crab pasta are all very nicely done. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Posh Indian Vegetarian Restaurant,negative,30,19-Mar-15,"I have always heard great reviews from people about the restaurant. But when I went there, I was not very impressed. The food was fine though I would say nothing special. On the other hand, the ambience of the restaurant was very nice. I felt that the prices of the food there were exorbitant."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab!,positive,40,05/15/16,"We always try different chili crab restaurant every time we go to Singapore and so far, this is the best. We went with our friends, and forgot to tell them to serve the fried rice together with the chili crab and everything, not in the end (it's their culture to eat the cheap food in the end) "
French,Paul,Not going back there,negative,10,27-Feb-16,"I was not amused by the bad service in the first place, but even the quality of the food (breakfast) was extremely sub standard. What do people like on this place? You sit in the poor ambiance of a shopping mall chewing on an uncooked waffle, sipping fresh juice which contains 60% ice cubes, or a cappuccino without even the taste of coffee.I visited ""Paul"" in Jakarta as well, and out there they know what service is, great quality of food and good ambiance. Maybe the singaporean branch should go for a week training in Jakarta how the job could (should) be done."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cut throat pricing,negative,20,3-Oct-17,"For tourists, take my advice, do NOT visit Newton Hawker Centre in Singapore. Because there are mamy tourists visit this centre, the hawker will tend to charge you at a sky-rocket price (especially the seafood stalls) than the local. If you are not aware, they may charge you $100- $120 per king prawn. If you really want to eat here, ask for the final price first before they cook.The taste of food here is of average standard. I personally prefer other hawker centres like Maxwell Hawker Ctr (they serve mainly lunch, no dinner)."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,All good except...,positive,40,17-Feb-16,"I ordered my steak to be charred on the outside and rare on the inside and got the waitress rudely rolling her eyes at me with the 'oh, another stupid Singaporean with a stupid order' look on her face. She thought I didn't see it but I did."
French,Angelina_MBS,Could be better,negative,30,14-Jun-16,"I had a cup of black coffee and a popular le Mont-blanc (dessert: on-top of the muffin size dessert is with chestnut cream, meringue + whipped cream). I've tried many ""mont-blanc"" dessert, I personally still prefer ""mont-blanc - chestnut dessert"" from Japan is still the best. I cant taste the chestnut. I don't really like the combination of meringue with chestnut cream. Is like eating coarse sugar with cream. The coffee (with steam milk) is ok, it comes with a chocolate.Service is good and friendly."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun experience but be savvy about seafood prices,positive,40,7-Aug-12,"A fun dining experience is to be had here. The hassle from restaurant proprietors is a bit overwhelming, so best to research and know which one you're going to.Singapore chilli crab was magnificent! Also had lobster. Check total price before agreeing to buy seafood. $6 per 100g sounds cheap but when you get brought over a kg lobster which you weren't expecting, it can get a bit pricier than anticipated.But overall such a fun experience. And did I mention the Singapore chilli crab ??"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),expensive,negative,30,05/16/17,tasty but very small portions and very expensive for what we recieved a pleasent atmosphere and prompt service but worth searching for better value for money
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,positive,40,10/29/14,My friends and I visited for lunch. We choose a la carte so we filled in the order form and all our selections were brought to us. The lavender coconut dumpling was AMAZING! Prompt service and reasonably priced esp for Singapore.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Dinner,positive,50,2-Jun-15,The dinner i had has made an unforgettable pinch of south indian excellence though i was born and raised there. It was just those tender idlees that will make you feel blissful and chutney's just mindblowing-Mouthwatering
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap? NOT! Quality at a good price!,positive,50,15-Jul-12,"Most people will say that Newton Hawker Centre is a tourist’s trap. But I highly beg to differ. Unless you’re looking to have shark’s fins soup and abalone, almost every other thing that you can find there is of a fixed price. Just check before you order and you should be fine. I’d actually think of this place as a place offering one of the better quality seafood in town, because with so much competition, you’d have to stand out in order to survive!One thing to note, the minute you enter the hawker centre, you’ll be bombarded by tones of people holding menus from all the various stalls, touting business from their prospective customers – you. They will try to be nice and offer to find you seats, but most of the time it will be somewhere near their stalls so that you’d buy from them after being seated. Just be firm, the hawker centre IS A FREE SEATING FOOD PLACE like all other food centers around Singapore. You’re free to sit where you want to sit, and eat from whichever stalls you’d want to order from. Don’t feel pressured; just tell the people nicely that you do not need their help.If you’re unsure (because all menus look the same, and every other stalls sell the same barbeque seafood lookalikes), look out for this A1 logo at the A1 Seafood near the carpark entrance. I’m a regular at this stall, and I can guarantee you that the lady boss is one of the most honest stall owners that I’ve seen around. Just look out for this lady with big brown hair and a huge smile. Everything on the menu is priced at standard fixed prices, so fret not (maybe except Crabs that’s by-the-kilogram and prawns are slightly pricier – only because these types of seafood are naturally expensive to begin with). The quality of the food is also consistent and tasty. I especially recommend the Seafood Fried Rice, the Sambal Stingray (Stingray with Chilli), Sambal Kangkong, Sambal Sotong (Squid), and the Chilli Clams. Also, do order their Garlic King Prawns if you have a bigger budget for dinner. If you’re not a huge fan of spiciness, you can always ask the lady boss to recommend you some of the stall’s specialties and she’ll find what’s best for you.If I cannot convince you any further, let my images do its job. But whatever the case, A1 is probably one of the more patronized stalls there (she’s been in this business since before Newton hawker was being renovated, and she has a lot of regulars who patronize her stall all the time.) Although the stall is not registered as a stall providing Halal food, many Muslims still patronize the stall as she uses vegetable oil instead of lard (it’s also a much healthier choice).Other highly recommended stalls are (taking reference from A1 Seafood):- Oyster Omelet (Orh Lua) that’s at the 6 o’clock direction if you’re facing A1, stall 73 – I usually order the $5 “Orh Lua”.- WHITE fried carrot cake from Heng Carrot cake, along the stretch that A1 Seafood is on.- Satay and Popiah that’s at the stretch behind A1 seafood, facing the Carpark (both are at the same stall, and it’s the ONLY stall that sells both Satay and Popiah together)IF you cannot find any of the stalls and want to know which stall is best, just feel free to ask the stall owners at A1. They know which are the best stalls there.Preference for food differs from person to person, but I have frequent gatherings with various groups of friends at Newton Hawker Centre and most of them like the things that I order most of the time, so I have strong confidence that my recommendations are at least of an “above average” standard."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but good enough",negative,30,06/14/12,"It is a good restaurant, descent food, good service, and great location. I wouldn't say this is the best dim sum, it is worth a try and pretty famous in Singapore. It is crowded during meals peak hour so reservation is suggested."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing ,negative,20,10-Aug-18,"When you only have one dish cook it well!!Medium rare is very rare .... beware!Also why to restaurants bring appetisers and mains at the same time... school boy error, and then leave the main on the side to get cold before serving. Very poor."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak!,positive,40,13-Sep-15,"The best steak in a long while, been here for the third time. Menu is straightforward and easy to understand, standard is consistent - always great service, memorable place. Lunch and dinner has the same quality service"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Popularity forces us to downgrade our rating,negative,30,08/31/12,"I used to be a big fan of Yum Cha. However, it has grown in popularity so much that (1) there is always a wait for a table, (2) the staff are overwelmed and getting a waitress' attention is a struggle, (3) because of the full tables, it is hard for the ""dim sum"" carts to move between tables, meaning that it is hard to get food, (4) it is very noisy, and (5) trying to pay one's bill takes a long time. Our trip there for lunch last Saturday was just not fun. I also noticed that food quality has gone down and prices have inched up. I recommend going to one of the many other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood -- after all, all Chinese food is about the same: lots of sauces and MSG."
French,Saveur,Average,negative,30,15-Dec-16,Supposed to be the place for cheap french food but prices have been creeping up. Suppose will be better topping up the extra to dine at a legit restaurant. Still tasty nonetheless
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Big selection of food; bring Singapore cash,positive,40,18-Mar-12,"Huge selection of food, you will find what you want. I want to echo and earlier reviewer who stated to look where the locals are lining up to find the best food.  Can get a good plate of food for around $3 - $4, not counting your drink(s), which generally will have to be purchased at a separate shop within the center. Also purchased a fresh fruit smoothie at a shop for around $2.Note to US travelers: They don't want US currency or credit card; walk across the street and pull out $20 Singapore from the ATM and you should be good. Those staying for a period of time in Singapore might find this advice silly, but those on layovers sometimes overlook it."
French,L_Angelus,Classic French Cuisiine,positive,50,6-Sep-17,"An institution of Singapore
We went for the steak tartare and were not disappointed
The restaurant was quiet but is was Tuesday night
Well worth a visit when in Singapore"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always good,positive,40,01/13/18,"It was the second time in a week we decided to go for chilli and pepper crab. We went to Holy Crab in Bugis area and was disappointed. Maybe it’s because we always wanted the original taste. So this time, we decided Long Beach since it’s always good. We ordered both pepper and chilli crab and thought they had changed the recipe for the chilli crab as it tasted different. In the end we realized that we were served Thai style chilli crab. For those who are craving for the original chilli crab, please make sure you order the right thing bec they assume you want their most popular Thai style chilli crab. I guess we will have to go back another time to have the original one we have been craving for."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good Food, But They Nickle and Dime You",negative,30,12/18/15,"I read something from the Guardian about this place being good so I stopped by here on my trip to Singapore for some dim sum.The food was good, above average even. The Shu Mai were succulent. The bean curd was delicious. I would be giving this place four stars except when I got the bill I noticed they charged me $2 for eating a couple of the little peanuts they put out on the table. They also charged me sixty cents to use the moist towelette on the table. Now maybe this is a cultural thing, but usually if a restaurant puts something out on the table without you asking for it it is a courtesy and you are not charged for it. I was charged nearly as much for a couple of peanuts I thought were free as I was for a dim sum item. This practice feels dishonest and I would recommend the management at Yum Cha discontinues it immediately.I would recommend this place, with the caveat that you shouldn't eat the peanuts and bring your own towelette!"
French,L_Angelus,Worst Service Ever,negative,10,11-May-14,"Worst service I've ever had in my life. Took us 2.5 hours to have dinner. Had to ask for drinks 3 times and go inside to bring out ourselves in the end.Owner was rude when asking we complained, saying write a letter to the ministry of manpower about the bad service.Food was average at best.Wouldn't go back if you paid me."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great value for fresh sashimi,positive,50,21-Feb-18,Sashimi was fresh and buffet selection was extensive. Quality of food served was great for the price we were paying. Service staffs were attentive to refill iced green tea

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent excellent,positive,50,15-Oct-14,"How do you fault perfect sushi? If you can pay the price, Shinji is worth it. Lunch is slightly more affordable than dinner but you do get your money's worth at dinner.Service was impeccable too. And yes, the birthday surprise was cool and I like that the sushi chefs have a good sense of humor. He joked that the team comes in early in the morning to practice.Yum. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service should be better,positive,40,15-Feb-17,"The food was good; the sashimi fresh. The service was very slow - you order what you want through the ipad at your table - some items took a long time to arrive and others never came. There was a lot of waiting, making the overall experience less than satisfactory"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere,positive,40,2-Jun-16,"We went one evening just for a drink as we could walk from our hotel , it was late on a Saturday night and still very busy . It looked very clean and lots of wash basins around the edge to be able to wash your hands after messy food like chilli crab . We went back on Monday and it was still surprisingly busy . It was good food but not much for a vegetarian . It is priced reasonably and a family of three sat at our table as it is free seating and chatted to us . It is well worth a visit ."

French,Paul,"Average food, high prices, poor service ",negative,20,3-Apr-16,"Moody staff. The kind that greets you as if in pain for giving them more job to do. Waiting to order, two waitresses passing by rushing answered me with ""hold on!, eh?"" ""Gimme a minute! Eh?"". You should train your staff to answer ""one moment please"" (while smiling) not difficult to do so. Upon ordering coffee with macaroni we were told that macaroni flavors are upon availability, meaning, we cannot choose. Can there be more non-sense? The food was ok but overpriced."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Idli paradise,positive,40,3-Jan-16,"Very popular, very crowded as expected.
Serves everything with 4 types of chutney and one sambar.
Idli is soft.The chutney fantastic
You must try the Small Onion Uttapam. Its fantastic!
And, of course the coffee"

Located just very near to Chinatown MRT, it is easy to find. The dimsum selection is quite original and most of them are good and tasty.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crab!,positive,50,1/4/2012,Best black pepper crab in Singapore. Lovely sitting in the garden. We go back time and time again.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cheap is Cheap gets,negative,10,20-Oct-14,"Great location. Thats it! There is a saying in Singapore, trying to find value invariably leads to disappointment. This place fits that bill. Its also destroying the brand!Not sure any of the staff know a chateaubriand from their rump - or where France is! Sadly the manageress doesn't seem to care! Needs a pull through from the top down. Until then - AVOID!There is better value for money elsewhere in Duxton. Better aperitif, better food, better wine and certainly better service! Great food and service to be had at Latteria and La Maison Fatien."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food quality with average service,positive,40,23-Mar-17,"The food quality was good but the staff was not very responsive, which could be due to the peak period at that time. Nonetheless, this place is highly recommended for its food if you do not mind a noisy environment to dine in."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Great food at good location,positive,40,6-May-18,"This is right opposite to Mustafa centre, a great place to be in.
Good north and south Indian food available here at not so costly prices.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Expensive sushi. Bespoke service.,positive,40,18-Sep-16,"I'll start off by saying that at 250 ++ (around $300) per pax, this was probably one of the most expensive lunch i've ever had in my life (without alcohol). Made a reservation for 2 person for a weekday lunch, and was promptly seated at the table by a Japanese lady. Service was really good and there was a personal chef to cater to the 8 customers that were seated at my table (including myself). Ordered the Omakase (a.k.a Yume) set. It started off with some sea urchins as appetizers followed by a series of maybe 7-8 sashimi. Each of the sashimi served was pretty fresh, but my partner and myself were both slightly dissapointed that they didn't serve use Chutoro (i.e. fatty tuna) for the price we paid. (perhaps we had too high an expectation). Desert was some cake, nothing too special though.Overall, Lunch was okay, it wasn't too filling. The chef was pretty cool, sharing information on the food that we were served and the origins of the seafood etc. Reminds me of the time when I was at Sushi Dai (Tsukiji market, Tokyo), where the Japanese chef was similarly very keen to share more about the Japanese culture. All in all, based on my experience observing what the other guests were having, I think that the 12 or 15 pieces of sushi is of better value than the Omakase (they are about $100 cheaper).Definitely do check out this place if you are looking at high-end Japanese cuisine in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A run for your money!,positive,50,25-Mar-17,"Great buffet - five stars quality of spread and individual plates - for the price you are paying, shin minori is extremely worth it"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great variety of food and service,positive,50,07/16/15,Service was prompt and the staff was very attentive. Great tasting food coupled with nice ambience. An overall great and satisfying experience. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I go there all the time...,positive,50,04/27/08,"I go there all the time, by myself or in groups. The seafood there is reasonably priced, but expect no frills service, or even very slow service. Also always check the bill, they tend to get it wrong often."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Night for Big Groups,positive,40,9-Feb-16,"Superb evening that lasted well towards midnight, must be the cheapest way to have ice-cold beers with friends in Singapore.

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Fantastic! Well Executed Japanese Restaurant,positive,50,1-Mar-15,"Had the lunch sushi set 12 pieces (including Sea Urchin, Otoro, anago) over the weekend. We sat infront of the Master Sushi Chef Oshino. Felt like we had front row seats to a culinary art show. Great performance! He had a junior chef beside him doing the more basic tasks. It was nice to see the master teaching him and sharing with us some sushi preparation tips. The meal was expensive, but the quality of fish was very good (they import fish direct from Tokyo 4x/week). The best sushi for me was a tie between the sea urchin and the horse mackerel. Will be back."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",As good as it can be,positive,50,18-Jan-15,"When you eat here, you don't miss India and that includes:1. Taste of the chaat and other food; they have retained the flavors2. Service is as good as you find in their Indian counterparts, which means that you will at times wonder where are the guys and gals who are supposed to take the order to serve3. Chole Bhature were excellent, you run 2 marathons the next day to compensate"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good food, but expensive",negative,30,3/9/2014,"Went with a few friends and for starters we had the prawn and chicken dishes. The prawn was great, good size and well seasoned. There was nothing special about the chicken. For mains we had pepper crab, chilli crab, spicy steamed fish and a mushroom dish. The pepper crab was outstanding and everything else was good except the chilli crab which was very average and I thought sweet rather than chilli. The bill for 5 of us was just over sd1000 incl a few jugs of beer. "
French,Saveur,A Few Good Dishes But Disappointing Promotions,negative,20,3-Nov-16,"The mains and pasta we ordered are good but the sides of Truffel fries and soup are less impressive.The promotion basically give a feeling that the company want to give but don't want to give, For example, chope vouchers cannot be used with promotions (luckily we ask before purchasing the voucher), if get combo then can't get the promo price, promo only applies to lower price items which is the usual practice.Atmosphere is so so and almost like fastfood restaurant feel, waiters are not proactive.Feel that overall even though some of the food are good aren't worth the price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Nice food, go for Sashimi",positive,40,18-Sep-17,Nice ambience and restaurant. Food was also above average standard. Especially like the sashimi. However aburi items have room for improvement

Food has been ok overall but I wouldn't choose to go there again. The first time I went my partner and my steaks were significantly under cooked, second time my friends steak was so fatty he couldn't eat more than half of it, last time they were fine. I'd actually be ok with the food if it was decent service. I've heard great things about the Ann Siang outlet but this one is appalling. I can't say any of the times I've been I've had any of the waiters show the remotest interest in being there or even be remotely friendly. One time we were the only person in the restaurant and I had to go inside for every step to find the waiter who was playing games on their phone. He literally seated us and went inside and left us to go play games without even pouring water."
French,Saveur,Yummy dinner,positive,40,17-Sep-16,Came here with friends and recommend having the duck confit. It was a nice evening dinner where we were able to chat and chill. Food was good but music was a little loud that we had to talk over it.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Exquisite Omakase,positive,50,19-Dec-14,"As I’ve heard and read so much about Shinji before coming to Singapore and it’s been on my must-try places to eat for some time, I seized the opportunity to dine here on a recent business trip, and I must say, the experience was absolutely sublime and exquisite. It is simply the best sushi restaurant outside Japan. When I walked through the sliding door and the three Japanese sushi chefs behind the counter greeted us heartily, I had to double check that I had not been tele-ported to Japan. We sat at the sushi bar – an arrangement where chef and customer are in close interaction. Our chef Yoshizawa’s skills with his knives and attention to detail in his preparation of all the dishes really made for a personable and enjoyable dining experience. After having experienced Shinji for myself, I read with amusement some of the reviews written by other contributors, some claiming to be well travelled and knowledgeable. Example, “menu is less varied (no beef and few cooked dishes)”? – oh please don’t reveal your ignorance by asking for beef in an exclusive sushi restaurant. The best Japanese fine dining is found in specialty restaurants, where the spotlight is on just one dish, where chefs compete among themselves in the quality and taste of a particular dish, and where customers can experience the brightest examples of Japanese cuisine.That’s what I love about Shinji. It serves the best Edomae nigiri sushi which means sushi prepared with freshly caught fish in the traditional and purist style of the golden Edo period of Japan; hence don’t expect to find salmon or crab sticks.And, “sushi pieces being less innovative”? I’ve been brought to some other Japanese restaurants (shan’t name them here) where the chefs blow torch their fish or garnish them in the name of innovation, but it is just a vain attempt to mask the lack of freshness of the fish that can no longer be served raw. It’s like, I was told, in Chinese cuisine, if the fish is not fresh, one shouldn't cook it by steaming, but frying with chilli may conceal the bad taste.Is this place ridiculously expensive? I certainly feel that I had good value for my money and there are other Japanese restaurants in Singapore that you end up paying the same and even more for lower quality food and poorer dining experience. The good thing is, at Shinji, you know how much you are paying for your food. There are no off-menu special dishes. Many a times I’ve felt ripped off in other restaurants by staff who (in front of my guests) recommended expensive seasonal items and then charged an arm and a leg. At least at Shinji, the omakase menu is all inclusive. Certainly I give this restaurant two thumbs up!"
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",The tastiest Cheese Paranthas in the world,positive,50,15-Mar-16,"After Singapore, I live in India for 4 years yet never met the same tasty Paranthas as served at Ananda Bhavan, opposite Mustafa Shopping Centre. Filled w Cheese, with chhole and some other sauces, yummiestthing in South East Asia!! Highly recommended."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Ambience and Good place,positive,40,11-Mar-15,"This restaurant is an upmarket vegetarian restaurant famous for its chaats with good service.Popular place,so seating might be an issue on crowded days."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese buffet!,negative,30,26-Aug-17,"Theres an electronic system for you to order your food and you can see pictures of various different food, however the system is quite slow and clashed a few times. Some of our orders did not come despite several reminders from us."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Get into the Singapore vibe!,positive,40,8-Jul-13,"You must experience this hawker centre on your visit to Singapore, it is truly unique and pleasantly surprised at the range of foods, cultural differences mixing with the locals. We avoided rush hour and had a late lunch around 2:30pm, no the queues! We had the fried kway Tao a Singaporean speciality, the chicken rice was to melt in your mouth, the satays fresh and tasty, roti with peanut sauce, the vegetables so green! All washed down with a cold icy tiger beer, you need this! Thoroughly recommend you do this, we are doing it again. Take tissues to mark your table and wipes for cleaning afterwards. There are ceiling fans but its all in the open air. It cost us sgd$15 per head including a large beer."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Father's Day ,negative,30,06/18/17,"Came here for Father's Day treat. The 3 basic requirements for a Dim Sum Restaurant are pork dumplings (Xiu Mai), shrimp dumplings (Har Kau) and Braised Chicken Feet (Feng Zhao) to taste the freshness of pork, shrimp and chicken. Had good meals at this restaurant before. Was surprised that the Xiu Mai is still ok but the Feng Zhao is tasteless. Off day for the Chef?"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun place to try local dishes,positive,40,2-Jan-17,"Newton Hawker Centre is just a short walk from the Sheraton Towers. Be aware, however, that it will require a small hike up a long flight of stairs to get up to the overpass to cross Bukit Timah Road. The food selection is good and very inexpensive. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit this Hawker Centre as there are many in Singapore, but if in the area, I would definitely recommend it."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not to my expectation,negative,30,04/20/16,"Prior to the dinner, I admit I had too high expectation on the food and this seemed to lower my dining experience. The theme of the dinner- London fat duck, as the name implies, the duck is indeed fat. Hence after the 5th or 6th piece of the duck, we got really full and felt sick of eating more. The restaurant also served other dim sum but the taste was so-so only."
French,Paul,They can do better,negative,30,21-Mar-15,Business lunch with the Boss. His tuna was overcooked which is a disaster if you a tuna eater. My cod fish was soft and juicy. Breads provided was good. Drinks ordered without ice came but it came with ice. Service was pleasant on this occasion. Overall was a good experience but the overcooked tuna does not help customers coming back. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only sashimi is good.,negative,20,9-Jan-17,Only the sashimi is good. None of the cooked food is nice. Yakitori is either tasteless or sauce too sweet. Bean sprouts teppanyaki is very oily. Sushi is average.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Pre-CNY birthday celebration,positive,50,01/22/17,"Had a lovely lunch with good service. The lohei was tasty. I liked the roast pork n roast duck as the meat was tender n cripsy. The salted egg salmon skin was also a nice treat. We tried the xiao long bao and it was juicy, the dumpling skin was not too thick. Overall the experience was really good. The food was fresh and not crowded for a Sunday lunch. Perhaps every was busy shopping since it was the last weekend before CNY. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoyable experience,positive,50,6-Jul-17,"The steak was cooked quite well and the fries were addictive. The sauce, as advertised, was legendary and went well with both steak and fries. Desserts were good too."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Fantastic curry,positive,50,16-Sep-17,"We had dinner on our last night in Singapore.
Great way to finish our trip.
The flavours were wonderful.
Really a very good curry and reasonably priced.
Only thing is this restaurant is on Dempsey Hill not Little India."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Seafood,positive,40,6/5/2011,"Probably one of THE places to go in Singapore for Seafood. It has the feeling its been established quite a while, more Raffles than Clarke Quay. Enormous, yes, faded yes, authentic, yes, crowded yes (reserve!), expensive (can be). Crabs are the the speciality and flown in fresh from around the world so not exactly ecologically sound.Ten minutes by taxi from Orchard outside the rush."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent value for money,positive,50,02/21/18,"Long Beach Dempsey is a wonderful restaurant, and it’s very accessible. The food is fantastic, and given that some Singapore restaurants can be expensive, I think this is moderately priced relative to the quality and service they deliver. I’ll be going back on my next visit to Singapore. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good service, great food",positive,50,10-Jan-13,"Great atmosphere, food was fresh and quick.
BYO available.
The staff were helpful and informative.
ATMs on site.
Good toilet facilities.
Easy to access by MRT, taxi and bus."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Loved the veg food,positive,40,21-Jun-13,Enjoyed the vegetarian food at Anadha Bhavan. We ordered a few dishes as we went about twice and all were good. This restaurant is a bit expensive.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",New fresh look.,positive,50,24-Sep-18,"First visit since refurbishment of old centre. Great place to eat. Very safe area to visit. With 80 plus vendors, there is something for everyone. The place is spotless, with cleaners continuously cicling the venue. I have read that people say it is expensive. This is untrue for what you get. First class meals in a relaxed environment. Very suitable for kids as well.Joe. Melbourne."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food,negative,30,29-Dec-16,"Generally, service staff is courteous. However, serving of food is pretty slow. I had the ala-carte buffet lunch. Honestly i am quite surprised that the price for buffet does not include drinks."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was impeccable!,positive,50,02/20/17,"We had a good quantity of dim sum and we spent considerable amount of time in the restaurant. I must say, the service was simply impeccable. They took care to attend to every single detail; including ensuring that we ate the item while it was hot; and ensuring that our tea cups were always filled. I was impressed and touched."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Cheap but not best taste,negative,20,20-May-18,"Price wise good though taste wise, it is not recommended to visit, they serve on Banana leaf, though the way chatnies (different sauce) were served it seems odd, and there is no taste to them, even the sambhar and dos doesn't taste the usual south...More"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Disappointing, overall.",negative,30,13-Nov-12,"We travelled to Singapore purely to eat here, and although it was good, it was by no means the best dining experience we have ever had, and I felt quite let down after paying the absolutely exorbitant bill. We were prepared to pay, and would not have begrudged one cent of it had it been as good as we hoped, but it simply wasn't. The service was attentive, at some times too much so - having the famously $20 glass of water topped up every time you take a sip was annoying, but for the most part the staff were faultless. I found the atmosphere quite sterile, and I couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer who found the lack of music disconcerting, when conversation lapsed, the silence was profound. And the food ... it was all good, but I simply struggle to remember anything other than the sea urchin which was stunning, and the abalone which was not! I think that says it all, sadly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood,positive,40,4/4/2016,"Was craving for razor clam and theirs are great, yummy. The crispy squid and tofu also yummy. The crab is ok, nothing special, same with all chilli crab. In overall its a good seafood restaurant, but reservation is highly recommended as its so crowded even at 6pm"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Impressive,positive,40,10-Oct-12,"My husband and I had three days in Singapore and didn't want to miss Waku Ghin. We were impressed with the attentive but discreet service. Staff were friendly when we initiated conversation. The decor is stark but not too cold. All of the food was impressive. The presentation of fresh seafood in a crate before preparation was a nice touch. We requested and received a tour of the immaculate kitchen. We were lucky to enjoy a laser show over the bay while enjoying dessert. We were offered extra petite fours and couldn't resist. Don't miss the coffee. All in all a brilliant experience but I do think it's overpriced. We knew what it was going to cost before-hand so weren't surprised. The bill was $1200 for two people including a glass of champagne, one of wine, a bottle of wine and extra petite fours (don't know if this cost extra). The personalised menu to take home was a lovely touch. I would recommend this restaurant to others for a special occasion."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A 48 hour experience ,negative,20,6-Aug-14,"We visited newton circus as one of our colleagues wanted to see what had changed in 25 yrs. his last visit Was a buzzy , lively place and I thought the food was great , however three others had squid and suffered very badly the next day , I'd still go back as I had a great meal but disappointing three people were ill "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good meal in very pleasant surroundings,positive,40,1-Apr-18,"Visited here with my wife - I had a sirloin steak and she had the duck, both of us were surprised at the size of our meat helpings - more than my wife was able to eat! The meat was cooked to our preference whilst the cook cam to check that my wife's duck was cooked the way she liked it. We had a salad included with our meals which was tasty and 'free flowing chips' we both already had more than enough with our order. The staff were friendly throughout he evening and we wold certainly return here."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",My favorite restuarant,positive,50,6-Jul-14,"I firmly believe that this is quite possibly the best Japanese restuarant outside of japan. I always come back for more. I ordered the omakase set, the lighter one for my birthday. It started with some appetizers like uni and squid and then it got better. The sushi is very fresh but perfectly marinated and done with the touch of an expert chef. I loved the care in which the chef prepares each piece. Then there were some sashimi and cooked dishes. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. Highly recommended. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Japanese - a la carte,negative,30,26-Jun-16,"The sashimi such as tuna, salmon, sword fish, octopus are thick and fresh. Generally acceptable. But the rest of the food are just mediocre and nothing remarkable to talk about. Salads have too much dressing hence very saltish. Fried vegetables - cabbage too oily. Complimentary salmon fish are served too early even before all guests arrive. The buffet doesn't include drinks - even Japanese tea and water are chargeable. Even though tea can be continuously replenished, but need reminders to fill the teapots."
French,Paul,Good Selection of Pastry and Sweets,negative,30,23-Sep-16,My friends and I have some pastry and sweets for dessert as a take away after our dinner in Ngee Ann City.Some of the food that we had are the chocolate eclair and chocolate mousse. The food are packed nicely into boxes to take home.Taste of the food are of acceptable standard. As the sweetness and pastry are done nicely.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Food,positive,50,07/27/17,The meal was great. Service was excellent. Care was taken in the small details. The ambience was great.
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Indian cuisine,positive,40,3-Jun-16,"This is one of our favourite Indian restaurants. It is tucked away in a quiet corner of the former military base in Dempsey Road. Our favourite dishes here include the briyani rice, chicken chukka, stir-fried mysore mutton, fish tikka, and papadum."
French,Paul,Business Lunch,negative,30,20-Oct-14,Quite cramped although decor looks chic and the place is clean and new. The beef tartine served on bread was weak although the salmon baked in puff pastry was enjoyable. Nothing particularly outstanding though and pricey considering that.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,positive,50,9-Dec-14,"An absolutely fantastic dining experience.Seats about fourteen (so make sure you book), all around it's main sushi counter where you have your own chef preparing your lunch/dinner in front of you. The decor is classic and simple and feels like Japan.We were here for lunch and opted for ""Tsuki"" (12 pieces of sushi) and were blown away. I have no idea what each individual piece was (couldn't quite understand our chef), but I can confirm the ingredients were incredibly fresh and of the highest quality. The rice was warm and filling, with each piece of fish having a perfectly judged amount of wasabi. It was a delight to watch a chef, clearly at the heights of his profession, go about his craft. There is not much in the way of non-fish so be warned if that's not your thing.Service was wonderful. Attentive, unobtrusive, and charming.A lovely restaurant and one we would love to visit again. Very good experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice time spent with friends, but the steak could be better",positive,40,17-Jan-17,"The steak was not as good as expected as it was pretty dry. But overall the service and environment is nice. Their sparkling water is surprisingly not free, so be cautious when the waitress asks you whether you want water or sparkling water."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Perfect Indian vegetarian restaurant,positive,50,14-Feb-17,I dined here on numerous occasions. Healthy and tasty vegetarian restaurant for all ages of people. Price is affordable as well.
French,Angelina_MBS,Bad Experience – pricey and bad taste!,negative,10,19-Jul-15,"Due to the local newspaper recommendations, we visited this café on my sister birthday. My intention was to give her a good surprise but ended with a big disappointment.We ordered their famous hot chocolate drink and Mount Blanc cake. For the hot chocolate drink, it turn out very thick, not hot at all and taste like medicine. The worst hot chocolate drink we ever had in Singapore. For the famous Mount Blanc cake, the outer brown colour cream was still hard (not de-froze enough) and obviously the cake was just taken out from the freezer not long ago.The bills was $60.05 for 2 drinks and 2 piece of cakes. We will never come back to this unprofessional café again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of hawker food,positive,50,29-Apr-17,"Went here based on concierge recommendation. Short taxi from Orchard Road. Amazing selection of hawker street food in a large, clean and vibrant area. The place was packed on a Friday night and we waited a while for a seat. You order and give them your table number and they bring the dishes to you. Hd amazing satays from RB Express Satay (not cheap though at 70 cents SGD per satay); great prawn dumplings; beer; oyster omelette etc. Delicious! We went by taxi and left by Uber - both really easy as they can drive almost to the door. Highly recommended!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious & reliable ,positive,40,07/23/18,"One of the few places left in Singapore with trolley service yum Cha, this is a busy and delicious set up. Good selection of steamed and other dim sum as well as all the usual suspects in Yum Cha. Loud, busy and great for groups- you come here for a good time not a long time! Get there early or late if you don’t want to have to queue!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as good as it used to be,negative,30,1/12/2016,"It was our second visit, The dim sums were mediocre, nothing special. I remembered they used to be better especially the egg tarts. It is conveniently open all day for dim sums though."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",It's all about the ingredients,positive,40,30-Mar-13,"This is a quite unique dining concept. You're showing into small rooms, each with its own teppanyaki-style grill and a chef assigned to you cooks the various dishes from the tasting menu in front of you. There's some exotic and expensive ingredients here but the flavours are surprisingly subtle - too subtle for my liking. Once you're through with the savoury courses, it's into the main room overlooking the CBD for the evening light show across the water and the dessert courses. It's an enjoyable experience but definitely in the special occasion basket because it's quite expensive. The individual rooms, when there's only a few people in attendance feel a little cold and strange but it's nice to be able to chat to the chef."
French,Paul,Abysmal breakfast,negative,10,11-Apr-17,"The omelette was not cooked through and the sausage cold. It was served on a cold plate and we had waited ages for it. We told the waiter about it expecting him to take it off our bill or reduce it as I didn't eat it, but said he didn't understand and ignored us. Don't go there unless you want to wait a long time for food that should be hot but isn't and served on cold plates."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Prompt service,positive,50,30-Jan-18,Food was wonderful and service was prompt! The staff would always clear our table every time we finished a dish to make space for our other dishes :)
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Delicious steak,positive,40,30-Nov-16,"Had the Ribeye steak on my visit. Requested the steak to cooked rare. The portion was relatively big, accompanied by a huge portion of French Fries. The steak I would say was one of the nicer steaks I had tried. Although it was a relatively short Anniversary celebration with my wife, I enjoyed the dinner."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic Seafood - relaxing location,positive,50,5/5/2017,"The service is excellent here. It was our first time eating Chili Crab and some other unusual (for an American) seafood, and everyone was helpful. I prefer the pepper crab to the chili crab (a lot less messy), but both great. I think next time I will ask for pepper crab with a side of the chili sauce to dunk it in."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",ORDO AB CHAO,positive,50,28-Oct-16,"Each course and its matched wine was a building crescendo of taste fantasies. on reflection, there were personal preferences - different for each patron - but the pathway remained as tantalising as the crumb chase of Hansel and Gretel , until the very last vestige.As good as the best - anywhere."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",chawanmushi having the smell of detergent smell in it.,negative,20,14-Jun-16,"We order 4 chawanmushi during our dinner. Eating half way my wife notice that there are some weird smell in it , so i get it from her and have a small taste on it .... to my surprise there are some detergent smell in it ,,,, immediately we ask the supervisor over for some explanation, to our surprise she just told us there are no smell in it and just take it back into the kitchen and just bring us another cup of it to us and ask us to try .... and tell us this is from the same tub. Frankly speaking we didnt bother to try that anymore and just keep quiet from there . But we are very sure we will never go back there any more and will tell our friends about this. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful food and beer is a fair price,positive,40,19-Dec-12,I have visited several times over the years. The food is still excellent. Take time to wander around before making your selection and don't buy everything from one stall. Particulary recommend the satay from a small stall in the far corner (near the loos).Large bottles of Tiger beer were selling for S$6-50 each - great value when compared to the S$15 to S$18 per pint chargred by many of the bars.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but less than I expected,negative,30,3-Dec-14,"Don't get me wrong, this is exceedingly good sushi in a nice environment and sitting at the sushi bar watching the very talented chef do his thing was a great experience. On these points I would probably give a 4-star rating however given how ridiculously expensive the restaurant is, it needs to be offering more than just good sushi and it fails to reach the heights of other places I've eaten that were priced (a little) more reasonably. The final piece of fish was basically a grilled/roasted shrimp head which was frankly unpleasant and only one of our party was able to eat all of it. So overall good, but there is far better value out there and I'll try somewhere else next time. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good memories on top of good memories,positive,50,3-Jun-13,"I first ate here a few years back with a friend and I loved the wide variety and the taste of the food in spite of the then crude appearance of the place.This time, I came back with my husband, kids and a small group of close friends and was pleasantly surprised. The place had been renovated, and very well, I must say. The food stalls are now at the periphery and the tables are in a central open-air area. It encourages socializing.Upon entering, one is assaulted by all kinds of delicious smells. Of course we knew that it would be impossible to order everything but we certainly tried--crabs, fish, chicken, squid, oysters, pork, beef, mixed satay and shellfish. The food was not fast but was well-prepared.There was no one trying to hurry us up. We were able to catch up uninterrupted. The only drawback to the evening really was the heat. Summer. Unfortunately, no electric fans in the open air part. But the food and the ambiance made one willing to sweat it out. So my previous memories of great food have now been reinforced with more memories of great food AND ambiance. Newton will definitely be on our itinerary the next time we're in Singapore."
French,Paul,Delicious food in lovely ambience,positive,40,5-Sep-18,"My wife and I had dinner at their branch in Tanglin Shopping Centre. We went there a bit early and there was no queue. I like the ambience very much - quiet and cosy. Service was good. The oxtail was one of the best that I've tried. It is also a bakery shop, selling a variety of bread and cakes."
French,Poulet,Decent food however not worth the price.,negative,30,21-Sep-18,"Visited this place with my gf for dinner. The service was good however the portion sizes werent exactly large. Even though the food tasted pretty good, I wouldn't return because of the price. I feel the price they charge isnt realistic for what you get, there are far better options out there for that."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wonderful Staff and Food,positive,40,6/6/2018,"Visited on a lunch time so the place wasn’t as busy! The manager and staff were wonderful! Great service! The food is also very Good! Chilli crab, razor clams and roast duck are all superb! The price is quite expensive but we can’t complain as the quality of food is really very high! It’s worth making a trip to Dempsey! Even with the abundance of choices it’s still worth choosing over the other Restaurants. Looking forward to going back soon."
French,Paul,"so so food, poor service",negative,20,12-Mar-14,"Went to Paul at Trader’s twice lately because one of my son was not with us in the 1st visit and wanted to try. Both times the bread was way too hard. Another thing that disappointed me was the restaurant’s apparent habit of dumping a basket of bread without offering plates or butter. It happened in my 1st visit and in my 2nd visit, I had to ask the Chinese waiter twice after waiting 10 minutes before he nonchalantly gave us plates to eat our bread; that was before our main course. I don’t know if its customary in French restaurants of this range, but it would take very little effort for the staff to ask guests if they wanted butter or plates (if one has to ask for plates in the first place) rather than dump the bread and disappear. Such dampener at the beginning spoil the mood for the whole meal and I wonder how the restaruant earnerd some of those praises"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Keeping life simple,positive,40,2-Oct-14,"If it's a steak you want. Steak you'll get. Simple concept. Flat fee for steak (either small or large) it's the ONLY entree: with add-ons for appetisers and deserts. Lively venue, not too noisy, with a good ambience and decor. A smart set of diners. Worth a visit. Good value for business lunches; date night and groups of friends.Like the option of carafes for the wine; as you can switch between courses. Tres bon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money Japanese buffet,positive,50,25-Jul-16,"I enjoyed the fresh sashimi and grilled items very much. Very good spread for the price, around $40 pax. Most of the items are up to normal Japanese restaurant standard."
French,Saveur,Good standard and meet expectation.,positive,50,17-Feb-17,"I always enjoyed the Duck Confetti on their menu, which is a must try. I must say this is a decent place to go out with dates, well not to forget to mention, the affordable price tag. If only they could come up with more innovative quality dishes for a twist!"
French,L_Angelus,Quality French restaurant ,positive,40,2-Aug-18,"If you are looking for good French food without burning a hole in the pocket, look no further. Located in the lively Club Street area, the restaurant is reminiscent of a typical quaint Paris restaurant. The quality of food was good as was the service."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Inconsistent Food,negative,30,18-Jul-14,"I've had their lunch buffet a few times over the past 3 odd years.

This is something of an accomplishment, given the surly disposition of the management and the unhelpful wait-staff (many of whom don't speak English). The challenge is to secure the items one intends; photos of many varieties of dim sum in the menu are of considerable help.You're going to spend a good deal of money to satisfy a healthy appetite, but the quality of the flavors you'll experience may well dull the pain in your wallet! Stated simply: Yum Cha does dim sum right!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good veg. food for Indians travelling to Singapore,positive,40,9-Apr-13,"Good veg food , good ambience. Price ok. Suitable for family with kids.
DO NOT EXPECT QUALITY SERVICE........its just ok."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice restaurant to try Chilli Crab,positive,40,11/14/16,"We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend and aware it would be expensive. We specifically wanted to try the Chilli Crab and the black pepper one but it was hard to judge how expensive these would be from the menu. The menu is very long and none of the set menus included both of these for only two people. We explained to our waiter and he said he would bring us two small crabs one of each type, we also ordered a rice dish, a vegetable side and some buns for the crab. For a drink we had a pitcher of beer. The total bill came to around €140 which was ok given we had been warned about the expense and had ordered two expensive dishes. Both crab dishes were nice but if you only get one the black pepper one was the best for both of us. On the whole we really enjoyed our meal. It looked like a place that was full of both expats and locals rather than tourists so a lot of repeat business. Given the chance I'd go back too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and good local food ,positive,50,4-Aug-17,My favorite food in Newton food center is BBQ stingray. Portion is pretty big and very cheap! Highly recommend chili crab as well(we chose #27 stand) if you don't wanna spend over S$100 in Jumbo. We had a small size of fried rice and chili crab and it was S$40 nett. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sun Specialist,negative,30,12/22/14,Eficient and friendly service. Good variety of dim sum. Tasty but not surprising. A place where local chinese families go. Over all an interesting experience. Advisable to arrive early as lines can be long.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet,positive,40,13-Sep-16,Nice buffet and the food is served fast. A lot of variety of foods to choose. Portion is small so that you can try most of the foods.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the BEST places for amazing food in Singapore,positive,50,20-Sep-17,"Newton Hawker Centre is a buzzing place with incredible food and a fantastic vibe. We tried so many food options and everything was amazing.....not to mention very affordable in what is an expensive city with cheap food and really good drinks options and prices (hello, $39 for a bucket of 6 coronas). Highly recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Centre of hassle,negative,20,1-Aug-12,The food was as expected (good) but the stall owner were a hassle - and confusion remaed about the pricing.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Fine dining at its finest,positive,50,2-May-16,"If you are a foodie and have the opportunity to splurge, Waku Ghin is one of the finest venue with a luxurious culinary experience to offer.Setting aside the difficulties we had navigating our way around Marina Bay Sands to find the restaurant, the whole dining experience really started as soon as you walk in the door.Service and Experience: Awesome. I love how there is a ""private"" room where it is simply you and the chef as he cooked the dishes in front of us. It's not a teppanyaki bar so do not fear having any eggs being thrown at you. ;)Meal: Exclusively exquisite. There are no other place to taste the dishes.Price: $1000+ for two and it was worth it.Notes: If you are allergic to seafood or if you (or your date) is picky with food, I certainly would have to suggest you think twice about going as you may not find it enjoyable in many levels."
French,L_Angelus,Good food and great ambiance,positive,40,19-May-13,"Me and my girlfriend ate here. We were a bit in intimidated when we walk in but the staff member made us felt welcome. Menu is good. Food appetizing, delicious and very clean"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec outlet - avoid this place,negative,20,25-Jul-15,"This is my second visit as I was not impressed at all on my first. And again, service is slow, inattentive and staff seem disgruntled when handling customers (come on, no smile?) Service in this ""bistro-like"" establishment, with servers wearing shirt, vest and tie looks awkward with ""mahjong"" paper as table cloth. Frankly, if you are running it like a bistro, make sure your staff don't look atas, serve atas and talk atas (atas meaning proud) cos you are not fine dining...Waiting time for main course (with a half full restaurant) is 20-30mins. Frankly, I will not be back. No wonder pepperoni next door is always full (and with queue) and Entrecote is always half full. For the price I am paying for the entrees and main course, there are many places around here to dine. Avoid this place"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Quick Service, Good Food",positive,40,23-May-17,"My 4th time dining at Shin Minori. Had a birthday voucher to redeem which was equivalent to a 1-for-1 deal - very value for money. Buffet menu was extensive with a lot of variety to choose from. Was impressed with the improved service as compared to what I had experienced in my previous visits. Seemed to have more service staff now too. They were attentive and had good initiative. Prompt to serve up dishes, clear empty plates from our table and refill our glasses. Food was fresh. Overall standard was good. Only gripe was that quite a number of dishes (esp. the fried and grilled ones) were under-seasoned and therefore tasted quite bland which was fine as it just meant we were consuming less sodium - healthier! Will definitely be back whenever the sashimi craving kicks in."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Food & Service,positive,40,15-Jul-17,Have dined a couple of times. A varieties of food. Have to pay for drinks but still reasonable. Great food & Service. My family and friends always enjoyed their dinner at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant! Thumbs up! Reservations is extremely easy too and impressive.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CNY Dinner,negative,30,1-Feb-17,Good range of food but service was slow and not all items ordered were delivered to us despite repeated reminders. Surprised to see sashimi was cut into 1-1.5cm thick.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",amazing podi idlis,positive,50,1-Aug-16,"Amazing ""Podi idli"" .. one of the best i have eaten. do not waste appetite on anything else :) Almost as good as the Murugan idli shop in Chennai .. not sure if this one is related."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Regrets,negative,10,2-Mar-18,"Ordered the cote de beuf for 3 person but sharing for 2 they said no free flow of fries. Look at the price come on it was just fries, we were just tourist trying your food, we even ordered dessert don’t understand why we cannot have free flow of fries. Was served by a pleasant looking lady we had indoor and she was crying that I had to offer a tissue, guess it is really not a nice place there. That all I can say is employees first then they will treat your customers right. Overall we regretted dining there though the lady was nice."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at cheap prices,positive,50,2-Mar-17,Great food at cheap prices. definitely worth the far walk from either MRT Stations (its sort of in between 2 stations)
French,L_Angelus,Nice evening,positive,50,6-Nov-17,"As we walked along Club street looking for a place to have dinner - we ended up at the porch at L'Angelus - eating a delicious french meal - instead of a nice Chinese dinner - as we had planned to do. They served us a delicious sole meuniere - (not even on the menu...) - - and the wine list was impressive.The guests at the neighbouring table were locals - and admitted they ate at the L'Angelus quite often - as one of their favourite restaurants in Singapore. We understand why...( service very friendly - and a very ""french"" interior - if that matters..)"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",High quality dining experience!,positive,40,1-Jan-15,"Even though it was quite pricey, we had a great time as the chef was very friendly and the ingredients were extremely fresh and unique. The highlight was the sea urchin with caviar! Heavenly! Would definitely come back again!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin minori,positive,40,23-Oct-16,Went with colleagues for dinner. Salmon spread was good. sushi is also nice.nice place to have friends gathering for chitchat.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pretty disappointing lunch experience,negative,20,3-Oct-13,"Went during lunch-time, it was one of the few places in the Suntec dining hall with no line for entry.We lingered at the front for a short while before a waiter finally paid attention to us and then pointed us towards an assortment of available tables.It then took them a very long time to come and take our order, and we were not served water without asking.The place tries to have an image of being posh but seemingly doesn't know if it is a restaurant or more of a cafe.We ordered the lunch special burger ($14.95++). Food arrived in a timely fashion and mine was not bad, but my colleague's was well under done. When we asked them to re-do it, the waitress tried to claim it was medium, when it was obviously rare. (we also weren't asked what temperature we wanted the burgers cooked to).The re-did the burger and it was fine afterwards.The cheque came quickly!Overall a pretty disappointing and drawn out experience. the food was fine, but really unless the meat is some A-Grade I was not aware of, you couldn't had a more fulfilling experience at McDonald's"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not greqt,negative,30,4/9/2016,"Friday night out with business colleagues. Food was good, not great. Service was just ok......prefer Jumbo Seafood, waitress not as helpful as we would have expected, but still overall fair to good experience. Don't think I will go back to this location.....just too many good rests in Singapore that act like they want my business!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but well worth it,positive,50,10/31/16,"I love the food here. From the soup all the way to dessert. Each dish was well executed - taste, presentation. The lobster dish with cereal was worth the extra calories. The chili crab is as I remember how chili crab should be made. The black pepper crab was rightly named Famous Black Pepper Crab :) The steamed fish was so tender, it just melted in the mouth. Even the roast chicken got raves from our dinner guests. Definitely will be back!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for dim sum ,positive,50,08/28/15,Visited hear for dim sum while shopping after being highly recommended and it surely never disappointed. Even though we arrived close to closing time the food quality was great and the service was good also. Priced decently and surely not too expensive. If your around the area I would definitely recommend this place. A must visit! #amit1chahal
French,Saveur,average,negative,30,26-Mar-16,"i loved the relaxed atmosphere, the food was good, but each portion-size was different from person to person. service staff were attentive and polite, definitely a plus point."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore","Good Food, Very Poor Environmental Practices",negative,30,29-Oct-11,The idlis are very fluffy and the other food is pretty good as well.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An awesomet experience,positive,50,20-Feb-18,I had dinner with my family at Shin Minori Katong Square and have tried their buffet. Food was delicious and service was great.My next visit to Singapore I will not hesitate to go back and enjoy their delicious menu.With lot of choices sometimes waiting time is an issue however our experience was wonderful. I cannot wait go back...
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food quality so so only. Duck is too fat. Lousy customer service.,negative,20,03/20/16,"We ordered the duck noodle. The duck tasted so so only. It had way too much fat for our liking. The noodle was bland and had very little sauce on it. I didn't take the veg because the leaf hung out of the plate and touched the table - disrespectful of the food and the customers they serve.Biggest turnoff: The service staff put the dishes meant for the table besides us on our small and cramp table while they made space over there. They neither asked for our permission nor apologised for the inconvenience and discomfort caused. They couldn't be bothered whether it disturbed our dining pleasure. I will NEVER eat there again, ever!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average Chhat,negative,30,13-Jun-18,"We went there for Chat, but it turned out to be just OK. Lunch choices are also available with reasonable service/I will say overall Average"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it.,negative,30,12-Dec-16,"Not worth to travel so far to a place which is not convenient. We can have the same quality of food at town. Food choices are limit, and drinks are not included in the package, thus ultimately is more than what you expected."

French,Paul,Delightful French style cafe (Tanglin Mall branch),positive,40,9-Sep-15,"I spotted this quaint little cafe in the mall next to the hotel I was staying in and decided to try it out for breakfast, in lieu of the uninspiring breakfast buffet I had in the hotel that day.Arrived at about 10 a.m. and the place was almost empty, guess I arrived after the rush hour and had most of the place to myself, except for 2 other tables. Had some really nice and thin French style pancakes, an almond croissant and a hot mocha, all very nice and better than most comparable places in Hong Kong and was pleasantly pleased by the experience."
French,Saveur,Efficient and helpful service but food is mediocre,negative,30,23-Jul-17,"The lady who served us was most obliging when we requested some changes to a dish which we appreciated. But the quality of our mains was below average. The duck confit was a tiny dry piece of duck leg. The beouf bourguignon was chewy, the taste was forgetable. The duck salad was quite good but v small. It's not expensive but not worth the trip "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Store 70,positive,40,16-Nov-13,"Recently had a meal at Newton hawker centre. Store 70 was the best. A must for service and quality. We could not fault the meal, plus we ordered food from another stall which they work together, this made for a memorable meal."
French,Saveur,Great experience and food at great prices,positive,50,20-Nov-17,Food was great; some of the best duck confit and most tender chicken i've had. Friendly staff and very comfortable atmosphere for a chat with friends. Decent prices too.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tremendous seafood with Friends,positive,40,09/13/13,"I enjoyed dinner with nine Chinese colleagues at an outdoor table. The staff did a good job accomodating a few last-minute friends joining us. The food was served family style and we had a great time. We had one of the multi-course prix fixe menus, along with a few additions. Black pepper and white pepper crab, fish, noodles, rice and veggies - all presented well and very flavorable. Enjoyed coconut juice served in the coconut."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must go. Food heaven of Singapore ,positive,50,22-Nov-16,"Local food at it's best at very fair price also closest to city center. All best grill seafood counter 39 is awesome, go order from the famous lady bee hive (big hair lady) she's super nice."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Different but good,positive,40,2/8/2015,"This restaurant was very popular the staff were attentive and service was quick. Recommend the BBQ Pork Bun, Shark's Fin with Meat Dumpling. The Prawn & Mango sesame Fritters were different but nice.BBQ Pork Flour Roll again never had them before but OK. Shredded Chicken Congee were very good and for desert we had Crispy Red Bean with Banana were also very nice. Would recommend this restaurant."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Veggie delight,positive,40,17-May-13,"This is a 24 hour facility opposite Mustafa, we had breakfast, quantity and quality both were very good, am told Pongal is a daily sell out item. Coffee is also good here"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food, decent pricing",positive,50,14-Jun-17,"Very decently - priced Japanese buffet. Most of the dishes are very tasty, the sashimi are pretty fresh. Would definitely be back for more.My only qualm is the small confined seating space for two. If you are of a Bigger built, you will get really uncomfortable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very lacklustre ,negative,20,4-Aug-16,High on choice but low on quality for the lunch buffet. The sushi is probably the same quality of those served at Sakae Sushi. Definitely not worth the $34 price tag per head for the buffet. The chuka hotate has to be one of the worst I've ever had. Do note that water is charged at $0.50 at this restaurant. The buffet does not include tea or any dessert. Quite disappointing. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sadly dissapointed,negative,20,7-Jan-15,Cold plates with thinly sliced steak is always a bad start. Tough meat also. Over priced wine. Had the impression that the nice people working there had never tasted their own food. On a positive not the chips were good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Overpriced Soggy Roast Duck and Roast Pork, Reheated Char Siew ",negative,10,5/4/2016,"Was at the Waterway Point outlet this evening for dinner. Waited for more than half an hour for a table at 7:30pm on a weekday night. Portions were small. Ridiculously over priced. Plain steamed rice was $2 per small bowl. 15 thin slices of char siew costs $12.80. First time, last time and one time too many!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great spread. Love the sashimi,positive,40,26-Nov-16,Nice ambience and service was polite. I love the sashimi variety there. The lunch buffet was worth the money if you are a sashimi lover. They have quite an extensive grilled spread too!
French,Saveur,French cuisine at the Cathay,negative,30,1-May-16,"Affordable French Cuisine at Cathay. We made reservation on line and was seated directly. Restaurant was crowded and seems not enough servers. Food are good. Try the variety of appetizer like salad, Foei Gras with apple and escargot, well prepared. We also tried the pistachio for dessert. Perfect choice. Can improve the service "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice experience,positive,40,10-Mar-17,"We enjoyed ourselves there! Food was prompt, and came hot and fast. Service staff was friendly and helpful"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood dinner with friends,negative,30,07/27/16,Open restaurant with private dining rooms available. Food is good and delightful. Winelist is rather limited. Service is above average.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Average food and service,negative,30,15-Sep-14,"Been here once for dine in and once home delivery. Evrything we had, tastes avegrage nothing special. Service just average. Lot of paneer(cottage cheese) options in the menu and, all paneer dishes tastes almost same. Too many spices in everything. Chaats are not bad but again, nothing special. Puri for pani puri could be alot better. I would only recommend their chana bhatura which actully tastes good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for crabs,positive,40,06/24/15,"We had chilli crab, chilli squid with convolvulus (kangkong),clams with hor fun noodles, deep fried marinated baby squid, a special bread (fried man you) to go with the chilli crab sauce and bamboo clams with garlic. My friend ordered the dishes and she is very familiar with the restaurant. Service was average. They tried to give us someone else's dish and we had to remind them about one of our dishes.The food was generally delicious. The dishes were not garnished or presented in an attractive fashion. You can byo wine. Seating includes air conditioned area indoors and al fresco outdoors. The tables are packed closely together. Restaurant is small and it is fairly noisy. Little ambience. Worth going for the seafood itself especially the crab which was meaty. They serve a large variety of crabs, some of which are air flown in from overseas eg Canada"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Reasonable food at reasonable price,negative,30,17-Sep-17,"We were jet lagged and needed a simple meal close to our hotel so ended up here. There are other hawker centres that are better, but we were all able to find something we wanted to try and enjoyed what we ate and drank. Place was clean with lots of staff clearing tables etc."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dimsum Restaurant in Singapore,positive,50,06/30/15,"Yum Cha is located in China Town Singapore, which is the place is less noticeable. But they served the best dim sum I ever taste. The LoMaKay (sticky rice with pork meat and salted egg, wrapped with lotus leaf) is the best ever. The Shu May also good. They also served the various soup menu and also porridgeLittle bit pricey, but totally worthed."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dangerously expensive but unforgettable,positive,50,28-Sep-12,"Clear some space on your credit card and don't miss this on your stop in Singapore.This is a dining experience like no other, its like having a very personal fancy dinner party, in your own flashy kitchen,(if you had one;)with a world class chef.If you have been to Tetsuyas in Sydney then you must go here....We had 5 guests, which was perfect to fit in one of the smaller rooms around the teppen. We had a really cool chef with a great sense of humour who explained everything and answered all our, I'm sure, tedious questions! But this guy was AMAZING, we wanted to know everything he was doing!The 10 courses sound like a lot but the food is light, yet still multi faceted. There is no choice with food except dietary requirements, to which they are very obliging. So some things may not be what you would normally order, but it's all about the ingredient experience rather than eating for hunger.Everything is prepared with great precision and care and fastidious order and cleanliness you would expect from Japanese fine dining. These chefs take their craft very seriously. Truly something to be witnessed. The service from all staff was impeccable as it should be in a place like this.We were very lucky to be given a tour of the large kitchen, before our desert courses. It was like an immaculate surgery. Just amazing.The only weird thing about this place is there is no music. Makes you kind of feel like you are there before its opened. Would be nice for some atmosphere. A big Thankyou to the staff at Tetsuyas Waku Ghin for making a birthday celebration one to remember."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,negative,20,25-May-12,"Iconic hawker centre, but most certainly a tourist place. A few good stalls but dominated by seafood BBQ stalls that charges exhorbitant prices! Go there for the atmosphere, and stick to non-expensive food like satays, oyster omelettes, fried hokkien noodles etc."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Harassed by dishonest vendors,negative,10,31-Oct-12,"This is a disgusting place to eat due to heat, humidity, poor hygiene and dishonesty.Store vendor # 49 pestered us to eat there and after circulating the food court once and being hounded by store vendors with what is essentially the same menu, we settled down at #49. Instantly the affiliated drink vendor requested that we order from him and so two coconut juices were bought for S$6. The crab was supposedly 900 grams and was quite tasty in Singaporean chilli sauce. When asked how much in total, the owner suddenly could not converse in English. The next dish two tiger prawns in garlic sauce were dry and bland. We dipped it in the sauce of the crab dish. The oily fried rice was equally bland and also had to be drenched in chilli sauce.Whilst dining, owner of #49 calculated on a napkin and when the bill for S$100 arrived we requested for a receipt. The receipt arrived five minutes later with the description “seafood dinner”. We asked for some descriptions and five minutes later abbreviations and prices were made available on the receipt. We took photographs of the complaints number to call but never managed to call. Would it have made any difference? Surely we were not the first customers to be cheated. After all that chilli we had some crushed ice desserts which was cooling and escaped the place."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Excellent, fresh, authentic",positive,50,05/29/14,"The food was some of the best Chinese food I have had. Located in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha handled our large group very well. The food came out hot and was clearly well prepared. It tasted fresh and was nicely spiced. They were sensitive to folks' allergies and food preferences."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Trying out this place famous for roasted duck,negative,10,11/12/2017,"A pure disappointment. The roasted duck skin is not crunchy and thus quite chewy. It ended up half of the serving, I had to leave it behind instead of into my stomach. The roasted pork belly, the first bite was ok. Then the second bite the meat is too hard. I m a food tasty. Definitely I have eaten much better ones. The Cheong Fun with roasted duck meat was a disaster. How can this dish be cold. Definitely not worth trying at all. Unable to eat this cold Cheong Fun"
French,Angelina_MBS,Interesting dessert,positive,40,3-Jun-16,"I had the signature Mont-Blanc at Angelina. Meringue, light whipped cream, chestnut cream vermicelli. Enjoyed this interesting dessert."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$16.67++ per piece,positive,40,26-Jun-15,"That's the cost per piece of sushi. I must say regardless of the price that the sushi was really good. Fresh, artfully prepared and the service was great. It was an experience and not just putting food in your belly. The ambience, attention the chef gives and the great service the waitresses gives makes it an experience. For 15 pieces you pay $250 which works out to be $16,67 per piece. But really you pay $250 for a 2 hours experience which works out to be about $2 per minute :) They do have the $300 and $450 menu as well."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Ok buffet - nothing special,negative,20,24-May-16,"Had visited the place for lunch buffet. The spread had good number of items but there was nothing memorable. Can give it a miss if you are looking for a spicy indian cuisine.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Average Yum Cha,negative,30,2/12/2014,"As other reviewers have said this restaurant is not so easy to find. After visiting this place it seems it is targeting the locals.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food but $$,negative,30,28-Dec-11,"Favour of tourist where you can try all sorts of local food, but over priced and know to charge tourist prices."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,worst experience ever !,negative,10,07/29/16,"Four of us entered the resturant for a meal, we decided the meals were a little too expensive for us so just ordered four entrees and a jug of tiger beer (equals 4 glasses at a cost of $38 for the jug).There were few meals that were reasonably priced but they ranged up to $160 +The staff were so rude we decided to leave, i usually read reviews like mine & think that maybe it is the customer that is the issue as i have never had an experience like this before, we would have stayed & paid the high prices but decided we could not put up with the staff & the fact there was no atmosphere what so ever. We were also brought a small dish of peanuts which we thought were complimentary as with the servettes placed on the table, when paying we were shocked to find a charge of $2 for the peanuts & $1.20 for the servettes, when questioned the lady at the register said it was not much for the peanuts etc, i replied the issue was we were not advised that we were being charged for same.Will not recomend this resturant or go back, ever !!"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Business Lunch - superb!,positive,50,24-May-12,"Amazing sushi! We lived in Japan for 3.5 years and this is the best sushi I have had outside of Japan. Conveniently located in the Raffles Hotel. The set menu is amazing, its expensive, but it actually worth it with the quality of the sushi and the experience overall. I tend to go at lunchtime which makes it a little more affordable"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",dont think when there is murugan idli shop in city for other south indian,positive,50,15-Jul-16,"very nice south indian food
murugan is same where ever you find its name
too many choice in murugan
small place with maximum space utilisation"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),High quality dim-sum,positive,40,7/10/2015,"Came here for yumcha and dim-sum on a Sunday. The food here is at high quality, for us coming from HK also felt the dim-sum here is of very good standard.You have stunning view of MBS while enjoy your meal. Price is expensive and portion is small, as expected in a top 5 class hotel. Size of dim-sum is tiny. Recommend for business lunch or a good treat for family."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,An old friend...better than ever,positive,40,25-Mar-15,"Used to go to the Ann Siang restaurant every Saturday without fail when we lived in Singapore, but always found the Rive Gauche restaurant (despite the setting) a step or two off the pace. However, was back in town last week with my son (14), and we visited the riverside version Saturday night along with a friend. It may have helped that the excellent Ann Siang manager happened to be at the riverside version for a week (and recognized us from a few years ago), but our food was absolutely outstanding, as was the whole evening. Usual starters included smoked salmon and terrine de maison, but it was the filets that killed it...absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked. Desserts were completely unnecessary...so we had them anyway. Only reason it's not 5* is the prices these days..and even that's a little unfair since it's the same story all over Singapore. Absolutely terrific."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab? Keep Looking...,negative,10,11/22/13,In a country full of great restaurants - this one helps to bring down the standard. I am a single business traveller that's been in Singapore for two weeks and have been impressed every day but at the Long Beach at Dempsey. The only thing worse than the Chilli Crab was the service. No follow up by the waitstaff - the Captain had to take my order. I sat for nearly 20 mins before someone asked if I would like my check - no interest in whether I'd be interested in dessert. A true disappointment. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent black pepper crab and cereal lobster!,positive,40,03/23/17,"Our group decided on seafood dining for our get together and the default recommenation was Long Beach, particularly the one in Dempsey due convenience in parking. I was treated to a great dinner of grilled squid with thick sesame topped sauce (really tender), an enoki mushroom dish, fried rice, a most flavorful black pepper crab which was tasty down to the last morsel and cereal canadian lobster which was sweet and meaty. What made our dinner more pleasant was the most efficient, friendly and courteous wait staff. Commendation for Ted, a cheerful young man who was all over the place helping the tables be served their seafood specialties. The place was packed - inside and out and was told this is normal in this restaurant. Dempseys is about 10 minutes from Orchard Rd, reachable only by taxi/car. The nearest MRT stations (Farrar Rd is one) can be quite a walk."
French,Paul,Not to recommend,negative,10,20-Jun-14,I was extremely disappointed that the food menu distributed on Every table as a set was only available as of a certain hour and I was told that I have to wait 20min until I could order it. Very strict timing; not really French.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper Crab in Singapore,positive,40,1/1/2012,"Good location, pretty good prices. They also do the crabs for you if you want."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good resto for Indian food,positive,40,30-Oct-14,"Being a vegetarian and Indian, my first choice was Kailash Parbat and I was quite satisfied with its food quality and taste. Pure Veg food and typically for Indians. U get good quality Punjabi food and other Indian food as well."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Services,negative,30,27-Jan-17,"Went to have early reunion dinner at shin minori, serving of food was kinda slow due to most probably not enough manpower for servers. Requested water refill but took quite some time to have it served to us. Few of our orders were missed out, waitress came to ask for last order and told that they left out few of our orders, went back to check but never came back and came to ask the second time for last order but we just forget about it instead"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Excellent Chinese Food,positive,40,11/21/12,Lots of Crystal Jade's around Singapore and can't say I have tried them all but all I have tried have been consistently good. Best to go in a group to try several dishes.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap,negative,20,26-Jul-12,"The closest hawker centre to the tourist belt but expensive and the food is not as good as elsewhere. If you really want to try better food, Go to Lau Pa Sat. A cab ride is cheap compared to other big cities. Of if you're really adventurous, then a true blue hawker centre like Tiong Bahru market is a good bet."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good Edomae sushi tasting menu albeit pricey,positive,40,23-Jan-17,"Really good sushi restaurant and great service. We had the Edomae menu which had 15 sushi options with a hefty price tag of S$220. The sea urchin and chutoro were particularly excellent, but the horse mackerel could be better and the temperature of the rice was inconsistent. "
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",Food is okay,negative,30,8-Oct-16,Ananda Bhavan is very affordable and the staff is not very friendly. It serves Indian food and has different counters for food and beverages. It is air conditioned and affordable.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",The best sushi meal I have ever had outside Japan,positive,50,25-Nov-16,We sat at the bar with chef preparing the meal in front of us. They onoy have 3 set price menues and not a la carte. We chose the middle menu ($300 per person) and were not disappointed.We decided to go to town on the budget and ordered a bottle of Champagne to drink with our meal.This was the best Sushi meal we have ever had outside Japan. Worth every penny.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Serving you spoilt chutney and pretending like they didn't know !,negative,10,5-Nov-17,"The coconut chutney had definitely turned ! Probably from keeping it for two days.
Go to MTR instead. Cleaner and tastier."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",The best Idli,positive,50,28-Feb-18,"Must say the best Idli ever had , super soft & very authentic . The place in itself does not look good or attractive but definitely worth trying"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good sashimi, the cooked food is meh...",negative,30,29-Jan-17,"Loved the sashimi, fresh and delicious....But the cooked food was overcooked and dry. Service was okay...price is exp considering the average quality of the cooked food"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Great sushi,positive,40,28-Jul-12,"I went to Shinji this week as it was so well reviewed. The place has an elegant feel, with prompt service. I ordered a sushi platter and every item was good and tasty. Pricey, but to be expected."
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Horrible experience - @ Landmark Village Hotel,negative,10,9-Jun-14,"Ufff....one of the worst Indian food ever and an equally bad service! Though a buffet everything was cold....there was a private party going on at the same time. We had wait for a long time to get the dishes refilled...breads were cold and hard..,just bad!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and efficient service.,negative,30,6-Dec-16,"This place is quite popular, so I decided to book a day in advance. However, the earliest time slot for the ala cart lunch buffet was 1 pm.Food was ordered thru a tablet which was very easy to use. Service was surprisingly fast despite the crowd. Now the food. The variety and selection was good. Taste wise however is nowhere close. There is really nothing to make one say that wow, I really have to order this the next time I'm here. Nevertheless, it did serve it's function as we were rather hungry at 1 plus pm.Please be warned that last order is at 2. 00. We barely finished the initial order when we were politely told of that. Perhaps it is my fault that I did not notice it on the website when I did the booking. So do book earlier time slots if you like to linger and take your time in eating."
French,Angelina_MBS,Not my cuppa hot chocolate,negative,20,4-Aug-16,"I'm a hot-chocolate lover! It's my everyday comfort drinkSo when I heard of how good and rich / thick the hot-chocolate was, I went gagaSince I missed the one in Paris, this is my best chance to tryTo my disappointment the drink fail me so miserably. It's overly thick that it's no longer enjoyable. Soon it turns to torture when I had to share that pot with someone else. I sat there for the next 1.5 hours trying to finish it. I think Coco Black has an even better richness than this. Also, they were ravings about its Mont Blanc but it was so dry, lacking moisture. I'm not sure if the one in Singapore is done differently? But it gives me second thoughts on whether I should go to the one in Paris if I'm back there.Utter disappointment..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin A Top Tier Japanese Experience in Singapore,positive,40,24-May-16,"The Sea Urchin and Caviar is a must for foodies. I would recommend showing up a bit early for your reservation as I really enjoyed watching the Marina Bay Sands casino just before entering into Waku Ghin. No cameras while watching the casino players, but it was a very interesting sight to see. Staff a Waku Ghin are exceptionally well trained, and sophisticated. For Mandarine speaking guests they have very elegant staff who can explain each dish in Mandarine. Service is what one should expect of a world ranked top 50 restaurant, attentive, with wonderful presentation. We opted for the wine pairing and the full menu. The wine pairing was very clever and went well with all of the dishes. I would recommend for the full menu doing the first seating. For us it was timed well to watch the Marina Bay Sands water show while having desert from the scenic Waku Ghin tea room. A very high end private experience."
French,Saveur,Slow service,negative,30,1-Oct-17,Service was slow despite the restaurant was quiet. Requested for baby chair but the table was not set up. Have to remind the waitress on the request. Taste of food was not on par as compared to other branches. Have to make multiple request for the ice cream to be served and the server was probably having a bad day.
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore","convenient, okay south indian food",negative,30,17-Jul-14,"my kids reached singapore and realized they didn't particularly like chinese food (although they do like indian-chinese in india), so we ended up at ananda bhavan a few times esp as our hotel was in the vicinity (parkroyal) and we kept going to mustafa's. the...More"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak !!!,positive,40,2-Aug-14,"They only have 1 main course and for good reason ... Its perfect !
They have welcoming sparkling drinks and a good service .
The restaurant does not take reservations and its actually a good thing !"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sense of real simple French food!,positive,50,24-Sep-12,"A wonderful setting, a simple but effective menu... Don't expect what they are not selling. It's not a romantic fine dining place. It's a great place to have fun with friends or with your family! Everything on the menu is as it should be done! Go on weekends and enjoy their couscous! Go any other day and you won't be disappointed! An address to keep in mind! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To complete my 3.5-day trip in SG,positive,40,1/1/2014,Disappointed by our visit to Jumbo the very first evening me and my hubby decided to try out probably one of their biggest rivals before we leave. Eventually got the chance today on our final day here and we are so pleased that we did. The staff were very friendly and proactive making suggestions being very flexible so we ended up with a set meal for two with chilli crab instead of black pepper and additional buns for dipping :)) the crab was really good and my hubby's favourite was the noodle which can't remember the name. Dessert came out with really cool presentation and we both stuffed n couldn't finish it all as it was a big meal probably enough for 3! Overall very good dining experience and would highly recommend. However there is always room for improvement...such as offering some bigger napkins to cover the front...also the ladies needs some serious refurbishment! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Watch out for touts, avoid the seafood!",positive,40,19-May-11,"This place is usually highly recommended on books and guides, however, as a local, I'd strongly advise tourists from having seafood at the stalls in this hawker centre. Better seafood at much better value can be found at other hawker centers around Singapore. However, newton hawker centre indeed serves well as a late night, supper place full of local cuisine that is of decent quality. Try the duck noodles, Cheng tng stalls over at the row of stalls facing the car park."
French,L_Angelus,Still good after all these years..,positive,40,19-Jun-16,I have been dining at this joint for over a decade and for some reason I still find it appealing though the price is on the high side but that's fine. So much for the recent feedbacks posted...one word cynical but then again to each his/her own.My all time favourites..foie gras...escargots...duck confit and their fish dishes. Will definitely be back always...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Please go to other nice Japanese restaurant,negative,10,22-Dec-16,"Food is served in very small amount/quantity. Some food were brought to our table not hot, but super cold. Keep serving wrong food and have to wait quite a long while. Waiters/ Waitresses friendliness depends on your luck that day. Most were rude and cannot be bothered with you. Many people said that their standards dropped. Some grilled food were raw inside.Overall, save your money to go to other Jap restaurants."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Definitely top 3 in Singapore ,positive,50,1-Aug-15,"Went with a group of 6. The bill came up to $2400 including a bottle of sake. The food is at its' freshest and finest. Is authentic jap food with no fusion. They do it the traditional way. Do request for room sitting, u have better privacy then the main hall. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Really like Dempsey. Good food & service,positive,40,12/5/2017,We were brought here by a local contact & I will make sure I plan a night in this area next time I come back to Singapore. I love how they’ve reused the old British Army Barracks for restaurants & bars. The food here was good & service was excellent. The chilli crab tasted great although you’ve got to enjoy spicy food to manage it
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,positive,40,20-Dec-16,"Place is decent. Food is tasty especially the grilled food and the sashimi is very fresh. However, service is a bit slow. and staffs not very attentive."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,the peper crabs are back!,positive,40,3/2/2014,The Sri Lanka peper crabs are just excellent. The location is nice : the large terrace is quiet. This iconic restaurant is quit expensive. Try it if you can afford it.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",No consistency in quality,negative,30,28-Nov-16,"We had heard great reviews of this place from friends in Singapore.Since it was close to our hotel, we visited it on the first day itself. We were very impressed with the idly, dosa, variety of chutneys and the tasty sambar. We visited once more...More"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Food heaven!!,positive,40,13-Feb-16,"Kailash Parbat is an excellent choice for Indian veggie food seekers in Singapore. There are 2 locations - one on Serangoon Road and one located opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road.They boast a large menu with a lot of food items raging from chat items like sev puri/pani puri to panner curries, nan/roti/kuclha, biriyani etc.Overall an excellent choice!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Most delicious crab,positive,40,05/16/17,"Had one of the most delicious pepper crab ever. Spicy and delicious. As I was on a business meeting, we were seated with a group in a private box and that helps keeping conversations inside. Beer was served by the Tiger team! Had a 'smoking' good desert afterwards as well."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Excellent!,positive,50,29-Jul-17,"Waku Ghin is a must visit for any serious foodie. A very enjoyable dinner with the freshest produce and excellent service. Especially enjoyed the botan shrimp with sea urchin, the restaurant's speciality. I've had the privilege of meeting Chef Tetsuya at another function and he is by far one of the warmest and most humble celebrity chef I've met. Kudos to him for flying his flag high in Singapore! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Disappointing steak,negative,10,12-Jan-18,"Went for the Christmas dinner menu with a friend and this is my first time there. This restaurant is supposedly special for their steak but it was chewy and bland. The very basic of salt n pepper rub prior to cooking the steak was not even reflected. The gravy was nothing to rave about either.Except for the fries and dessert, the meal was disappointing. Oh we had escargot for entree to share...again if there was no garlic butter cooked with the escargot the taste was bland. Understand you cannot get fresh escargot here but surely can be done better at this restaurant.We asked for tomato sauce for fries and they didn’t have...even the table next to us asked the same. Sometimes it’s not about what you want to serve but what the customer wants!!For the price they charge, I feel there’s better steaks out there.Decor was nice, French bistro feel but that won’t get me back there."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Superb,positive,40,23-May-17,The experience is always awesome with KP. Their chaat and amazing mouth watering dishes one would always love to try. When away from home this is perfect place to get best vegetarian indian food. Their chaats are worth a try specially Pani Puri if you get the cravings 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Full of festivity at night ,positive,50,2-Nov-15,"So this is suppose to be a tourist trap but it's still so fun. Come at night for dinner or supper simply because there is so many people around. A lot of the stalls seem to sell the same thing which is seafood of various sorts which if fun once in a while. if you are want the more simple stuff like various noodles, po piah or oyster omelette. The thing is there is plenty of choice and there are so many stalls to choose from. It's open air so it can be hot. During the day, it's just not as much fun so it's really a place to come to at night. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Delicious Varieties of Japanese Food!,positive,40,1-Jun-17,"The place is clean and tidy.
Tons of different food to choose from.
All of them are delicious to boot!
but the tablet of which to order the menu from often crashed :("
French,L_Angelus,"Awesome food, unpretentious plating",positive,40,16-Feb-16,"Quality food comes in generous portions and unpretentious plating. The seared scallop with squid and pumkin soup were excellent; so was the delightful beef steak. The hot chocolate cake was to die for, while the plate of 10 assorted cheeses was delightful."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic ala carte buffet,positive,50,3-Oct-18,I came here for their 1-for-1 ala carte buffet by Chope.The sashimi was very fresh. The other dishes they served were tasty too. The served each dish we ordered in small portion so that we can eat more variety of food in the menu. I like!My husband and I kept coming back for this promotion because it is value for money and we get to eat our favorite Japanese food at a fraction of what we usually pay in other Japanese restaurant! Very good deal!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sure is fat and juicy,positive,40,09/14/17,"They live up to their Name. The duck meat is sure fat, juicy and tender. It might not be the best roasted duck ever but it is satisfying enough. Their other dishes are good too, like the roast pork, char siew which is on the fatter side which makes it softer. Service is quick and friendly too."
French,Saveur,Long-awaited meet-up with friends,positive,50,9-Jul-17,"I chose saveur as the perfect venue for a dinner gathering with a group of friends so we can meet up after not seeing one another so often. It's my second time to the restaurant. One of the reasons why I like coming to saveur, is the sense of home feeling. I love how beautiful the ambience, design and decor is, very unique to each individual restaurant. Pricing is also made affordable. Knowing how crowded it can get on Fridays and weekends, I'm glad I still choose to reserve a table for my guests and I through the Chope app. It's helped me in so many ways. In saveur whenever I show my booking code, they already knew we were being expected there. With chope, I can always feel at home and at rest, and a feeling of closeness. Thanks to the saveur team for hosting us. will dine again at your restaurants soon. Date of visit - 7 July 2017"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A delightful Japanese experience.,positive,50,28-Jun-12,"I've been to Hokkaido and tried several accomplished restaurants there and Shinji's food is about the best sushi you can get in Singapore. The food is served with very little seasoning as it is really fresh. Moreover, the chef will add a subtle twist to the sashimi and the whole experience for that dish will be enhanced tremendously. The chef also brings in seasonal food and changes his menu regularly. In addition, they have a list of really good Sake that goes very well with the food. To top it all, it was really a personal experience with the chef serving the food with a lot of attention and humour."
French,Saveur,Thumbs up,positive,40,13-Jun-16,"Reservation was fast to confirm & everything was good. However, not quite sure why the restaurant that day had a very strong oily or fried smell that lingers on your clothing. Normally it wasn't like this."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck,positive,40,2/12/2017,My first visit has left a satisfying impression although the portion of duck served included a fair amount of boney bits. The meaty bits served did taste as good as the famous roast duck restaurant in Bayswater London. A side order of the water cress soup with pork ribs was decidedly flavoursome and the meat well cooked. I will return when I next fancy a London roast duck dinner!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cant get enough,positive,50,3-Aug-12,We loved it all especially the variety of dishes and the very very cold beer to wash it all down. An absolute must for all travellers to Singapore or rest assured you will feel that you have missed out on a spectacular culinary experience.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty Chilli Crab,positive,50,04/26/18,"If you don’t make it out to East Coast then Long Beach restaurant in the Dempsey area is a great place to get your fix of chilli crabs. Best to book in advance, the place gets very busy. Last order is 12:30am every evening."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Best meal ever,positive,50,30-Jul-14,"Absolutely the best restaurant that I have ever been to in my life. The freshest ingredients, impeccable service, and friendly staff. The uni with caviar is my favourite. Just melts in your mouth. Over the past year, I have found myself dreaming of the food at Waku Ghin since our first visit, and had to come back again and again for a quick fix. Thank you Waku Ghin, every penny spent here is well worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,positive,50,4/11/2013,"This appealing second floor place in Chinatown serves the best dim sum anywhere we have been, including home-base NY, Hong Kong, Hawaii, etc.Everything is cooked to order, as opposed to the cute roving carts often seen. You order yourself, guided by the list which has many photos of items. Wonderful flavors and combination of ingredients such as snow peal leaf/prawn dumplings, prawn asparagus dumplings and many more. Service is efficient if not personable. Ice cold Tiger draught.This is a ""must try"" aNd definitely worth returning to if you have the time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, good athmosphere",positive,50,2-Apr-15,Most of the time I'm in Singapore I come over at Newton for dinner and I've never been disappointed!

We loved the onion soup; the meat and french fries were OK.
But average service and a bit over priced."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Perfect Singapore chilli crab,positive,50,6-Nov-17,"Alliance seafood’s Singapore chilli crab is mentioned in the Singapore Michelin guide and as expected it’s faultless. The Sri Lankan crabs are fresh, juicy and tender and the sweet and tangy sauce has the right level of heat. The fried mantou (buns) are the best to soak it up with. They go that little bit extra and provide plastic gloves and napkins. Look for stand 27. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Quality veg food,positive,50,24-Jun-17,"we visit kailash parbat at lest once a month. Good veg food. Paneer Makhani, pain puri, chinese dishes all very good and yum. value for money"
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good food bad service,negative,30,2-Mar-15,"The idlis and dosas are tasty and worth the higher prices that you pay here compared to similar places like Komala Vilas, but the service is slow and surly. I think the waiters gravitate towards those who they think will tip generously, the counter staff...More"
French,Saveur,Good,positive,50,25-Apr-16,It is a place where good food are made affordable for people. The service is also good with the venue being accessible from dhoby ghaut mrt station.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fine Dining in Little India,negative,30,27-Oct-15,The place is slightly like a Fine dining restaurant in Little India. Hence it is pretty expensive compared to the other restaurants in Little India. The food is decent.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Ginza sushi without having to fly,positive,50,5-Apr-12,The food is most definitely worth the hefty price. This place (out of all the Japanese restaurants in Singapore!) is the place we'll go to when we're craving good Japanese sushi and we are never disappointed by the chef's creations.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good old Newton Hawker Centre ,positive,40,19-Oct-16,"I grew up with Newton. This was our fave food place after a night out in town during the 1990s. The current revamped hawker street food is more organized and cleanliness has improved tremendously. Some all time fave food would include prawn noodle soup, oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, BBQ stingray in sambal chilli sauce and hokkien fried prawn noodles. There is a Chinese dessert stall in the left hand row as you enter via the car park. They have one of the best Chinese dessert selection at good value prices. Dining here this evening certainly brought back many memories"

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must try chili crab,positive,50,06/16/17,Have been there several times but the chilli crab always have been the tastiest and never disappointed us. Portion can be big but the friendly waiter always advises you what is best.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazingly fresh and succulent (So Impressed),positive,50,09/21/17,"Long Beach @ DEMPSEY Located at 25 Dempsey Road. There are many famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore, but Long Beach has to be the top ONE. I make it a point when I have visitors or friends visiting Singapore to take them to Long Beach for there more famous Singapore Chili Crab and black pepper crab and off course for the other scrumptious seafood on offer. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best oyster omelette Hup Kee stall 73,positive,40,3-Dec-16,"One of the best oyster omelette in Singapore. Still the best to date. We have been eating from this Aunty for more than 10 years. Her oyster omelette is always fried to the right colour, nicely browned, and not too oily. The oysters... Always big and very fresh. A must try when you are at newton hawker. Also generous with her garnishing of coriander and spring onion. A must-eat when there!"

This is my first dinner at this original raffles hotel branchThe menus are the same between Regis and raffles. Opted for the Wa menu again , the middle oneA procession of gorgeously prepared food came. The sushi and sashimi are all divine. The cooked food like miso cod etc. are also of a much higher standard than elsewhere Sake prices are not sky high There was a couple celebrating their anniversary and the chefs put on their funny masks and broke into song. Always so hilarious when they do that. Wonderful "
French,Paul,Good for takeaway but horrendous for dining in,negative,10,29-May-18,"We were planning to have lunch at the nearby Japan town when we were at Kinokinuya bookshop. Then our Mother saw this establishment reminding her of the one she patronised in Paris. So we decided to divert and had our lunch here instead.There was a small waiting line outside. Not bad considering it was lunchtime.Then we were ushered to a table at the corner. Good, we thought.Order was taken then the waiting began.The 2 orders of a sandwich and a sausage omelette came earlier. The other 2, a quiche and a spring chicken, took a good more than half an hour after the first 2 orders were delivered.We noticed that the second wave were delivered almost immediately after we asked them to check our orders. Coincidence?The food quality:In general, quite average for the legacy and the price level.We shall stick to takeaways next time"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Delicious, and nice touches",positive,40,04/13/16,"Delicious: chilli crab (spicy yet subtle and not over-powering), deep fried baby squid, pork ribs. Nice touches: bibs and crab shells unusually well pre-cracked that further cracking was not need to get to the contents. Efficient and responsive service; perhaps being a weekend and not full helped. Pricey; as expected for fresh seafood."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great yum cha...but...,positive,40,5/10/2016,"This place is excellent - lots of choices, little servings of everything so you can try as much as possible, cheap(ish) for Singapore and quality, efficient service. The only disappointing thing was that you had to have shark fin Xiao Long Bao. I love this dish but don't like contributing to the practice of killing off the world's sharks. Get the dumplings in chili oil and the pork buns. Bon appetit! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab lived up to reputation,positive,40,5/8/2016,"Early Saturday evening managed to secure a table for four even though we had not bookedOrdered the signature prawns, I really liked, but the family were not that impressedThe Black pepper Crab was a little slow in arriving bit worth the wait.Don't know why we have been before as just around the corner!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place to eat to experience the Culture,positive,40,20-Jul-17,"This is the place to go for a group where you can all choose your individual favourites. There are many many small outlets all servicing different cuisines, from Indian, to Indonesian, to Chinese and many more. It is cheap and very good fun. You can choose what you want and then all sit together at the outside tables in the middle and mix and match!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,A little cozy French Restaurant,positive,40,14-Feb-17,"Although the place is rather hidden, it was not very difficult to find behind the renovation works. Nothing to boast about the outside view as it was all cordoned off with. However the cozy ambience in the restaurant could make up. It was not a decadent deco, just warm and relaxing surroundings with kopitiam chairs, simple list of menu and bits of French posters.The restaurant wait staff are helpful, Restaurant Manager is friendly and can provide good recommendation. We ordered a ribeye steak and sirloin steak. They are quite huge (approx. 200-300 grams). Served with generous portion of salad and fries. Steaks are great, delicious and a real value for money. I asked them to change the fries to salad and I received two large portion of salad, the service staff accommodated to my request happily. Genuine, hearty food. They have quite extensive options for wine, but their house wine was wonderful! I have never enjoyed red wine as smooth as theirs. The dessert was unassumingly fantastic. I love how the cherries was soaked and drenched in brandy with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. This is a little heaven."

Maybe Shin Minori can kindly address this discrepancy in pricing.Another thing is we waited for quite some time before our food arrived, given that the restaurant is almost empty.Thanks."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum and very good value,positive,50,09/23/12,"I always bring visitors to Yum Cha for the experience and of course the food. The service is usually average to poor, its incredibly noisy at lunchtime at the weekend and you usually have to queue for a table.However it is all worth it for the food. Excellent dim sum, great flavors and incredible value for money. Can't say its a relaxed experience but definitely a 'must' if you are visiting Singapore."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Spicy Fish Head finished with refreshing lime juice. ,positive,40,23-Sep-18,"The large size fish head curry dish was a little too much for three of us.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Mother's day celebration,positive,50,05/13/17,We are seated with a cozy corner which has a nice garden view. Food is all good. Baby squid is crispy with dash of sweet sauce. Assorted mushroom with sio pek chye is unique with the taste. Not to say the lala hor fun is its house signature. The crab of course is the most fantastic dish. 
French,Paul,Really bad service,negative,10,17-Dec-17,"We pop into Paul's at Marina Bay Link fairly often for coffee a pastry breakfast and unfortunately last weekend when we went down for breakfast after ordering coffee and breakfast we waited for about 15 minutes for coffee and when my Wife went up to the counter asking how much longer it was going to be was informed that they were short staffed and she just needed to wait.Firstly make sure you have enough staff, not the customers problem. Secondly and this is important it is now what you say but how you say it, the dismissive nature in which my Wife was spoken to was unacceptable. How sad, so many places to choose from and one staff member creates an atmosphere of pure negativity.I assure you out of principle I will not be returning, albeit I do like the custard slice as an indulgence once in a whileStaff make or break your business!!!"

We went early New Year (1 Jan 2016) morning (10:00am), since everyone still suffering from hangover during countdown (haahaahaa)....We ordered duck, pork belly, char Siew, and dim sums.The duck is good but not great. Quite bony. Crispy Pork Belly and Char-Siew are better.Dim Sum are not bad too. The Crispy Char-Siew Pao is a must tryThe plain noodle is quite tough, not good.When we finished around 11:15am, the queue already formed. Overall, its okay food. Give it at try.The place is in Basement 1 (B1) Scott Square Orchard Road) The building next to Tang Plaza (which is opposite ION)"
French,Saveur,try the baked chicken instead of the known duck confit dish,positive,40,4-May-16,foie gras was of top standard this time. the pasta was a little plain w little tiger prawns in mini cubes. the oven baked chicken was freshly baked and the truffle mash go along w it perfectly as usual.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood!,positive,50,9/2/2015,"Wonderful seafood! You won't be disappointed by the food, although I wish it would all come at once and not bring out the vegetable dish when we have almost finished eating everything else!The staff were very welcoming in this occasion and it was great that they shelled the crab for us. Note you get charged 30c for each towelettes you use and $2 for a plate of peanuts that you did not order, and they automatically add 10% service charge, but if you know this in advance then there are no surprises!You cannot beat the seafood here.... I will be back next time I am in Singapore for my next visit."

I mean... if you just want a quick meal and get out, no problem there. BUT, if you want to enjoy an evening having some of our beloved local food, this is the wrong place to head to. Avoid this place if you are a tourist and want to have some decent seafood at a fair price. They are just 'sharpening their knives' and waiting to rip you off the moment you get there!!! And if you are a local.... what are you doing there? At least thats what i am thinking after my last outing there!"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Lunch,positive,40,28-Dec-15,"Delicious and authentic North Indian food- naan, briyani and steamed rice, served with different dishes- including few vegetarian dishes. Meat is obtained from a halal supplier but no Halal certificate is displayed as they serve liquor. Good service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible Service From the Manager,negative,10,31-Jan-18,"Horrible service from the waitress and manager. Waitress made a mistake with one of the apps, told us she will ask the manager will honour it...just to get the final bill without anything honoured and manager refusing. What happened to the service it use to have 3 years back?"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good dim sum, so-so service",negative,30,2/3/2016,"The long queue to get in - including many locals, or at least apparently ethnic Chinese people - suggested good things ahead.When we got to our table, tea and Tiger arrived promptly. We ordered in part off the menu and in part from the trolleys. The steamed offerings were good, the fried were a little bland and boring. The wok-fried spinach (with ginger and garlic) was outstanding.Service was, at its best, patchy. Staff seemed run off their feet, and although we were given menus, it took a long time to flag down someone who could take our order. Likewise, the trolley circuit was erratic, and we had to wait for long periods to get attention (and food).The location in Chinatown is great, and the place itself has a pleasing atmosphere.There are better dim sum elsewhere, but Yum Cha is an institution."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",OMG what a sushi experience ??,positive,50,3-Oct-18,Had a quick impromptu business lunch and strolled in just after 1pm without a reservation. The service and reception was impeccable. The Chef ? what can I say. The very best I have come across in Singapore. Engaging the client in a meal with a running commentary and making the entire but brief 12 piece sushi lunch set all too brief but what a sushi ride . A little pricey but what an experience 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,negative,30,04/30/11,"Good food, esp. black pepper crab. However more than once I've booked tables only to find no booking when I arrive. Distracted service."
French,Saveur,Value for money,positive,40,15-Jul-17,"Authentic French food can be pricey in Singapore, which makes this place an absolute gem. The Duck Confit was delicious and very good value for money for the price"

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Nice food, quite authentic environment, value for money",positive,40,8/9/2013,"Located in the 2nd floor of this shop house in Chinatown, it's one of the traditional style of dim sum service - push carts, a nice touch.Food is very good - everything from Siew Mai, Har Gow, Char Siew Pow, Lo Mai Kai.I personally felt the porridge was average.Try the crav meat soup dumpling, around sgd6.80 per bowl, really nice."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Fresh, delicious, omakase lunch from friendly 1 Star Michelin Shinji (Carlton Hotel, Singapore)",positive,50,19-Jun-18,"Boss brought two of us here as a surprise, during lunch. This is my second visit; previously, the chefs were at Shinji, Raffles Hotel.The size of the restaurant was just right and it was neither noisy nor quiet. Feel free to talk. Our chef paid attention to our conversations and chatted with us on some matters. We had an expensive omakase set - SGD 300 - this set included a plate with four types of uni, all of which were sweet. Chef informed us the order in which they should be consumed. The seafood was terrific in general. I enjoyed watching my chef press and shape the rice with seafood. I took numerous shots with my mobile and he was ok with that; he even smiled and mock-posed for me once !The dish with the monkfish liver was the best I had - lucky me, my boss gave me her portion. The monkfish came in two generous portions, and were served with a big slice of octopus, daikon with sea eel (I'm guessing from the pics because I can't remember), prawns or lobster and (this is what I enjoy most in Japanese fine dining) decorated with maple leaves and hydrangea.The last dish - fruits - included a generous (and expensive) sweet slice of honey dew and mango (also very expensive and very sweet).Altogether, a gorgeous lunch - great food, friendly chefs. Feel free to let them know you dislike certain tastes or smells - both my colleagues had them exclude wasabi and one of them asked them to hold back spring onions.If you have spare change, drop by Carlton Hotel Singapore for Shinji and enjoy the lovely Chihuly glass sculpture at hotel lobby."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice people but food very poor,negative,10,17-Jun-16,"The food was very poor, low quantity and bad quality! People nice but in the end you need to eat properly right?"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Like eating in Tokyo,positive,50,30-Aug-14,"Wonderful place that you wont be disappointed if you love eating sushi and sashimi. Please note that the food is more traditional sushi so it is not the same as what you eat in a normal Japanese restaurant. It is not cheap, but if you appreciate quality food then this is one place you should go. They have 2 branches and both are the same."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Celebrated Father's Day,positive,50,20-Jun-17,"Sashimi was fresh. Enjoyed the variety too. Though busy, staff
were polite and tried their best to tend to our requests. Enjoyed our dining experience there. :)"
French,Paul,Afternoon Tea,negative,30,26-Feb-17,"For our afternoon tea of today, we decided to go to Paul Cafe at Takashimaya Shopping Mall, Orchard Road, Singapore. Location-wise, it is easily reachable.Paul Cafe originated from France and in Singapore it is located at Level 3 Takashimaya Mall.Customers come in numbers, so prior booking probably advisable.Since it was fully booked, we decided instead to do take-aways. Services were quick and servers were also responsive.For a croissant, a madelaine, a pain au chocolat, and a ""sugar pizza"" we paid SingDol 13.70. I would argue it's reasonable, quality being taken into consideration.The surroundings were also nice and practically while sipping your tea or coffee you could observe the bustling Orchard Road.The cakes tasted good, classic European. I really enjoyed its choco pain.Overall rating is 3/5 as restrooms aren't available inside the establishment."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Heaven for food lovers,positive,50,17-Jun-14,This probably is the best meal I have had. I have never been to Japan so if Sushi is better there then I hope I go soon. My client took me here and I have to say when I looked at the prices I blushed so try and find someone to take you there. The food is fresh and sculptured into bites of heaven. The Maki sushi was my personal favorite.
French,Angelina_MBS,The desserts might be better...,negative,30,25-Jun-15,"We chose Angelina Restaurant / Tea Room because of its quaint, sophisticated beauty and because Coco Chanel frequents this elegant exquisivity (in France itself, of course) often. The exterior suggested a classic touch of elegance while the interior exuded artistic charm and comfort amongst a strong French setting.For mains, *L had the Truffle Ravioli (SGD$29.00) - tiny little jagged squares of pasta stuffed with cheese. Lovers of cheese would gladly indulge in this pasta dish, sinking their teeth into the firm pasta so that the burst of cheese could fill the mouth deliciously - truffle hints were detected amongst the cheesy indulgence.*J went for the Wild Mushroom Risotto (SGD$23.00) - actually all three of us were eyeing this dish. It did not disappoint, not with its rather generous serving of truffles, rocket salad and brothy-rice. The flavour could have been a little stronger, more sapid with mushroom taste, but we were only able to taste it here if we bit into one of the shrooms pieces literally. I also thought that the grains were cooked till too mushy, lacking the bite that I usually enjoy in risotto dishes.For me, I chose to have the Steamed Black Cod (SGD$35.00) served with Shellfish and seasonal vegetables. Black cod always contains a scrumptious buttery smoothness to its texture, combined with a taut, slightly springy tone; the flesh was saccharine. I also enjoyed mussels and clams, being a seafood lover. But oh, the broth, the broth was the ultimate climax - combining the goodness of the seafood and every sip drew out the need to want more; even the soft baby potatoes were sufficiently immersed with the tasty broth.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-angelina-tea-room-patisserie.html"
Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Lovely buffet,positive,40,28-Jun-15,"This place has a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. On the veggie front, the saag paneer was amazing.

French,Paul,Tom O,positive,50,19-Nov-12,"While walking through the Takayeshama shopping center we thought we would look for a restaurant to eat lunch. Remembering what Anthony Bordaine said on his travel food show that usually where there is a long line, the food will probably be good we started looking for the long lines. At the same time, I was looking for a money exchange place and on the 2nd floor, I found the money exhangeer and a long line waiting to be seated at the restaurant Paul Bakery. I think I was also attracted to the great bakery smell wafting through the walkways. After being seated, we ordered and split a bowl of broccoli soup and two outstanding sandwiches. The soup was exquisite and the sandwiches were wonderful. We sat in the outside walkway and were able to wach people as we ate. Of course after eating lunch, we had to take a box of two bite sized macaroons with us for later endulgence. This is a French boulangerie/patisserie at it's best and it was packed with customers."
French,Saveur,Quality Italian food at wallet-friendly prices!,positive,40,11-Sep-17,Saveur serves really quality Italian food at prices that are easy on the wallet. Must tries are definitely the Original Saveur Pasta (just $4.90 only ??) and the Signature Duck Confit!

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Simply great,positive,50,20-Sep-15,"Definietly one of the best sushi restaurant in Singapore. All the dishes - not only sushi - are simply delicious. Needless to say, a bit pricy but considering the location and the cost for bringing all fishes from Japan, that might be necessary. Other than the food, I like when strict-looking chef shows humorous side to celebrate customer's Birthday."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nothing special,negative,30,20-Aug-12,"Went to this food centre yesterday for dinner. spacious open space, not so smoky but once you stepped in the area, there will be a few people help you to look for empty tables and they'll bug you after that with their food menu. It's good for their service but frankly speaking i don't like to be forced to order their food because of that. Food was okay, could say that every stall cooks same types of food, a bit pricy. Overall, it's just another food hunting spot for tourists? "
French,Saveur,Saveur @ The Cathay,positive,50,5-Jul-17,I had a very pleasant dining experience at Saveur together with another couple. Very satisfied as they serve value for money food along with very good service and atmosphere.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Love the dim sum trolley service,positive,40,04/20/17,"Now that trolley service has all but disappeared on the London dim sum scene it was a real treat to see it in action in Singapore. A decent selection of both steamed and fried dim sum, the usual suspects like ha gau and siu mai but a few unusual dishes I had not seen before too. If you couldn't see what you wanted on the trolley just ask and it would emerge from the kitchen. Portion wise its like it used to be in London about 30 years ago but where London got smaller these portions remained ample!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good food, horrible service, filthiest bathrooms I've ever seen",negative,20,11/6/2012,"How to rate this place I wonder. The food we ended up ordering was good but the road to getting there was not without hassle. Due to non-smiling, no english speaking, non-personal and frankly non-caring about anything or anyone staff at this place you are on your own figuring out the menu. If you would know what to get it wouldn't be a problem and you just don't give a crap about the horrible, unhelpful service. Unfortunately, we were without help and ended up with a bit of a strange menu mix of dim sums. True, they were good but I feel it could have been so much better. Only go here with advice or knowing your stuff and you'll have an awesome lunch/dinner. Otherwise avoid it because you'll leave the place not feeling totally satisfied and there is no need for that in this part of town."

Indian,"Riverwalk Tandoor, Singapore",Average Indian Food,negative,30,2-Oct-11,"The buffet has not so many varieties. It does not get replenished quickly, so sometimes you will find nothing in the pan. I feel that there are more vegetarian dishes compared to the meat options. The taste is nothing special. I have better Indian foods...More"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Go for the Duck!,negative,30,08/31/15,"Ok, the name is attractive. Expect to queue since the restaurant doesn't take reservations. The duck is fatty, dripping with oil, succulent, sinful i.e. tasty. The other must-try dish is the pepper-flavoured duck meat bun which is freshly baked. Apart from these, I had tried the char siew and the roast meat, both of which seemed a tad ordinary. But the duck is worth coming back for. Service is quite prompt and courteous. A crowd-puller in the otherwise quiet basement of Scotts Square. "

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrible dim sum and poor value!,negative,10,11/30/17,"I went here after reading the mainly good reviews on TA. I found this place to offer very poor value for money and the dim sums themselves lacked flavour with very small portion sizes and fillings. I mean, I’ve had better dim sum all the way in the U.K. If this place is meant to be one of the better dim sum places in Singapore then I’m afraid you are better of choosing a different cuisine. I spent $20 on three dim sums and a soft drink for myself. Whilst it may seem like good value compared to the U.K., believe me, it isn’t. They make up for it with the size and quality of the dishes. The glutinous rice was a joke. Hardly any filling, the rice was mushy more than glutinous and it was tiny, half the size of a playing card. Much better food around in China Town. Hey, go to the award winning and Michelin Star, Hawker Chan place two minutes walk away where an excellent meal there will set you back $3; yes, three dollars. That just puts things into perspective.

The food I ordered white and cheese sandwich with I think it's really basic , it was served cut in 2 Mc hot and with some horrible salade ( see pic) Won't go back and will not encourage people to go This is institutional in france or even in Japan but here is nothing "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic and delicious seafood,positive,50,28-Apr-16,Very good variety of local cuisine and also alot of fresh seafood dishes to choose from. Would recommend this place to many tourists as the place accomodates to many people and has quite a huge varety of local dishes. One may also compare this to the famous Lau Pa Sat which is another food place enjoyed by both locals and tourists. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey,negative,30,3-Feb-13,Worth the try but a bit pricey compare to other locals hawker centre. Good to go there once for the experience.

Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",SouthIndia Food Place,positive,40,3-Jun-16,Typical food place known for its south Indian cuisine @ reasonable prices if you do not care for ambience & environment and are prepared to wait for the table.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum,negative,20,03/28/17,"The restaurant was located at the second floor of the shophouse. Although it was weekday, it was packed with lots of tourists. Menu was a single 2 sided tick list. I was showed to a table by the window. Although there was power under the table, it was not working. So don't plan to charge your hp while eating.Pumpkin Yam Golden Cake ????? (S$4.20++/ 3pcs)The texture was not bad with its crispy top, but it was a tab jelat if having more than a piece and quite oily towards the end. Taste was one dimension.Squid Ink Dumpling ????? (S$4.80++/ 3pcs)The folds wasn't perfect. One piece wasn't even folded in.Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ????? (S$5.20++/ 3pcs)There's holes in the dumplings. I was surprised to find this kind of standard in their signature dumplings.Home-made Almond Tea ??? (S$4.20++)The texture wasn't rich and creamy. It looked kind of like the instant type - sweet and lumpy. Service was spotty. I was told to go to the cashier when I asked for the bill. I could spot customers with their bills served to them at their tables. Also spotted that the next table of Japanese customers had a piece of plastic in his glass of beer. The staff who cleared the glass blamed on the plastic covering the ice cubes, but did not apologize. One could see clearly that the group of customers was clearly upset. Although the customer was later told by another staff that the glass of beer would be waived from the bill, the damage had already been done."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good food, not enough service staff",positive,40,24-Feb-17,"Not the first time I've been to shin minori; this is our family's go-to restaurant for Jap ala-carte buffet. A group of 4 of us went for the lunch buffet, it was pretty crowded though it was a weekday. Glad to have made the reservation on chope or we may not have been able to get a seat. Food was good, as usual, always love the sashimi which is extremely high quality, thick, fresh pieces. However, the service that day was particularly slow, though I attribute it to only 4 floor staff and thus I feel it isn't really their fault. Perhaps the management may want to look to hiring more staff for service or it is very tiring for them as well to serve continuously for hours. Other than that, shin minori doesn't disappoint and they are definitely a restaurant we will continue to visit :) "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Food n service,positive,50,10/20/16,I brought my family to peach blossom at marina mandarin to celebrate my dad's birthday.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Sinful Dinner,positive,40,17-May-18,"These days in Singapore, we do not have much Hawker centre like this.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced,negative,20,24-Mar-18,"Whilst not a complete ripoff, the dishes are definitely way overpriced.For example:Chicken Fried rice Newton: $20Chicken Fried rice Tanglin Mall: $6Food quality is only average, or maybe it’s the price leaving a slightly bitter taste.There are a lot of locals there, which indicates they are either happy to be charged 3-4 times more, or they are getting a different priced menu to the tourists."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Superb food, average service",positive,50,4-Feb-17,"Went to Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant on the 2nd Feb. Restaurant want not that busy when we entered. The reason I always patronise this restaurant is because the food and free flow and we don't have to get up from our seat. It's all ordered from a tablet which is provided on the tables. The food quality and presentation is really great. However I feel that providing wasabe for every single dish is very wasteful. Most of the times the staff had to clear my plate with the wasabe not even touched. Service staff there are average. However I feel that the managers there should take their job more seriously. Most of the time I can see them chit chatting in the back and even eating food at the back during service. When I thank them for clearing my plates they just totally ignore me. If you are looking for good food this is the place. However, don't expect any service "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Closed for renovation & off the topic,positive,40,26-Mar-16,"Wanted to visit Newton Circus last night, but the taxi driver convinced us that the place has been closed. So decided to visit Lau Pa Sat instead after 20 years. No reason to go back there again. Food was below par, the whole place was somehow very messy. Very crowded though, so not everyone may share our feeling.Just checked, according to the National Environment Agency homepage Newton Circus is closed on 1 February - 24 April 2016. Suprised to see some reviews from February visits.Anyway, waiting for the next visit to Newton. Maybe not the most original of hawker centers, but we've always been happy with the food and service in general."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good food, service average",positive,40,6-Jan-16,"Great ambience because we had a table outdoor with a great view of the river. Food was great.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good quality food, good quality service.",positive,40,9/10/2016,"Have celebrated a few wedding anniversaries including our own and a few birthdays in Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin Hotel Singapore. Variety and quality of food is good. I have personally known one of the service team leaders, Terry Lim for many years and he has always been very attentive to his customers, knowing their likes and dislikes. We just had a dinner with another couple friends in Peach Blossoms a few days back to celebrate the birthday (of the wife) and their wedding anniversary. Though Terry was away selling mooncakes but his colleagues, Nobel, Christine and Alicia served us with equal attentiveness, and arranged a pleasant surprise for our friends. They had an enjoyable dining experience that evening.Thank you Nobel, Christine, Alicia and Terry. Keep up the good work! It takes a big heart and humility for one to be able to work in the F&B industry with passion despite the long hours and numerous challenges with difficult customers from time to time. I see these in you! :)"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food!!,positive,50,20-Feb-15,"I went to Newton Hawkers for an early lunch and found that a lot of the stalls were closed. A lot of the store owners there try to get you to read their menus and hope that you will buy their food, but I went for the Chilli Crab at Modern Grill Seafood.The service there can be quite crass when you place the order, and it takes a little while for the crab to come out (about 15 minutes, despite the fact it wasn't very busy at all), but I really enjoyed it. The mud crab had lots of meat, great flavour and they give you a bowl of lemon water (and a heap of napkins) to wash your hands after. No utensils given, so you have to use your teeth and hands.The whole crab was $45 including the fried man tou (white buns) which came in ten. The whole thing was delicious! You get your hands pretty dirty though. We also got Iced Teh from Syed Ishak Teh Tarik stall, served by a lovely man! The drinks were fantastic. My sister also had prawn mee, which she really enjoyed.A great Hawkers Center, pretty authentic, nice outdoor area, adequetely clean and it has (like many Hawkers Centres) sinks just out the front to wash your hands in. A quick, convenient place to go for food!"

After a 20 minute walk, our noses told us we had arrived!We were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived as there were so many options. In the end we had chilli crab and fried rice. It was really yum (and messy)!For a large chilli crab and fried rice for 2 it was around 50 Singapore Dollars. This did feel a bit expensive, but I guess it was crab, and everything else was cheap.Would definitely visit again."

Particularly enjoyed the foie gras appetiser and the beef short ribs. Good value for a French meal. We were pleasantly surprised to be asked if we enjoyed our meal. Good that the management valve our feedback.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Some tasty dishes, but difficult for a gluten-free diner",negative,30,05/20/15,I have celiac disease and wasn't able to get clear explanations of which dishes are gluten-free or can be prepared that way. I took my chances on chili crab (the server said it had no soy sauce) and greatly enjoyed it. I didn't find much else I could safely eat.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",No fin with my nori at Shin Minori,negative,20,21-Feb-18,"The buffet menu is long, and encompasses all styles of Japanese cuisine (except shabu shabu). The quality is pretty awful, worse than Sakae Sushi. We tried this out with the Entertainer 1-for-1 offer; otherwise, at $41.90++ per pax it’s not worth it, with such poor quality. Contrary to other reviews, we found the wait time quite good. Service is pro-active. Maybe an acceptable choice for some, but sorry it ain’t us."
French,Saveur,Value for Money French Food,positive,40,25-Dec-16,"Value for Money French Food. Service is a tad slow though. They seem short handed.
But the food is good for its price.

Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",I found the food just ok,negative,30,9-Apr-12,Nothing special for vegetarians who accompany non-veg eating guests
French,L_Angelus,"The wrong place for a French ""Art of Life"" experience",negative,10,10-Feb-12,"A very basic interior design. We could have expected better French touch to beautify this nice shophouse in the heart of a historical street of Singapore. Very dim light, dark enough to hardly decipher the menu. Fortunately, the service was fine and courteous. The main issue was the food. The menu is very poor, proposing the same skinny shortlist of stereotype French food that several so called French Restaurants in Singapore serve at exorbitant price, under the pretext that French food is very special. Hundreds of other delicious French recipes are left aside, presumably because they are longer to prepare than heating the content of a mason jar in a microwave. The duck confit that we ordered was by far overcooked and stringy. The home made chips were dripping with oil, dark and hardened by overcooking. The bread of the onion soup was impossible to chew due to a cheese layer harder than a sole. We were not taken by the pricey wine. Only the chicken was nice. But it can’t justify the astronomic bill we had to foot. Not to mentioned that our successive remarks to the waiter on the cooking issues didn’t have any impact on him or on the management. We felt totally cheated and scandalized. French cooking can offer such inventive and diverse tastes at reasonable price. It is sad that some unscrupulous entrepreneur make their business on local attraction and ignorance for French cuisine. Don’t waste your time and money. There are some other reliable French restaurants in Singapore."

Keep up the good jobs Paul Singapore!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Salted egg xiao long bao & Chilli crab xiao long bao,positive,50,01/27/16,"Food was good, especially Chilli Crab xiao long bao. If you do not exactly fancy spicy food, you could still give it a try.Salted egg xiao long bao was below my expectation, there were not much soup in each of the buns and the meat was kind of dry, compared to the usual xiao long baos.Ordered the La Mian with scallion and dong po rou as well and it made the trip there on a rainy day so much more bearable. It tasted heavenly! I could still remember that awesomeness 2 weeks now since I last had it.Great service, great food!"
French,Paul,Very good food. Not just pastries.,positive,40,18-Oct-16,"Paul @ Tanglin Mall looks like a normal bakery with a small seating area for those who wants a quick bite. I never knew they have a full selection from breakfast to dinner until my sister introduced us to the place. With a 50% discount from Eatigo, our party of 6 shared 2 salads, 6 mains, 3 desserts and 2 pots of tea for about S$144 only! The food was fresh, nicely done and well plated, desserts wonderful. We had the mushroom and seafood salads, the beef, cod and lamb as mains. For desserts, the bitter chocolate cake in a mound with gold leaf topping (forgot it's actual name), coconut flan and lemon meringue tart did not disappoint. My only small gripe was that the wait staff though competent, was a tad quick to shush us out of the cafe around 8.45pm, granted the closing time is supposedly 8.30pm. Go early if you want a leisurely dinner. The usual pricing is a bit high for the lack of ambience and space but becomes a good deal with the promotional pricing. I would go back again if the promotion continues. I do think people will go back if they reduce their normal pricing slightly to compensate for the lack of ambience and very cramped seating. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good service,positive,40,7-Jul-16,Waiters were very attentive and the manager gave good recommendations on the mwnu when asked. We will back soon.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun clean with excellent Street Food,positive,50,12-Sep-15,"Recently met up with a number of old school mates for a reunion in Singapore and we decided on having a street food night, Newton Circle came immediately to mind as it is fairly centrally located and is on the main MRT track through town. Arrived around 7pm, already quite busy with many already well advanced in their street food experience. You go around to various food stalls and order what you want, sometimes you need to pay there and then with others you pay when your dish gets delivered. Each table has a number so you best remember that when ordering otherwise you may wait a long time and go hungry. We had a great mixture of Indian and Chinese dishes along with a few plates of very nice chicken satay (always a must!) all washed down with a few Tigers and real coconut milk straight from the coconut. Prices were a little on the high side for street food, but it is a tourist attraction. A fun night was had by all and would certainly head back to Newton Circle next time I am in Singletree."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Worst Peking Duck,negative,10,09/19/17,"We have just dined at Peach Blossom, unfortunately. After reading great reviews we thought we would book. One of my favourite and my husbands absolute favourite dishes is Peking Duck. We ordered 1/2 a duck, this was not carved at the table... not a problem, but what we were brought already wrapped 8 pancakes filled with a small square (8x8mm) of duck skin, just skin, no fat, no meat. We were then bought fried rice with tiny chunks of brown duck meat. Hmm wonder what happened to the breast meat if our duck? We also had the jelly fish and the XO Cod, neither were particularly good. But the Peking Duck, ridiculous :("

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Noisy, poor & disinterested service and bad food.",negative,20,17-Aug-16,"We ordered two fizzy drinks, a coffee, two entrees, two mains and a naan.The entrees were plain and uninteresting. Spice dusted dry potatoes with day old chopped coriander on top. Blergh. One drink (sparkling mineral water) didn't turn up so we asked for it again and got a room temperature bottled still water. Sent that back and ensued a long and boring conversation about what sparkling water is. We decided not get no fizzywater at all (there was tap water on the table already), and 5 minutes later a lime sparkling lime drink turned up (yep, one we specifically said we didn't want). The waitress honestly didn't give a rats, hardly listening the first time and not taking the time to get it right.Nowhere does it say that this is a VEGETARIAN restaurant so I've just saved you 10 mins trying to find a chicken dish on the menu. The curries we ate for dinner were quite nice - good temperature (both spice wise and temperature wise), and good portions. The naan was ok but not the best.You can see the hand washing basin to the toilets from the dining room which is a bit weird. And there is a bizarre combination of English and non-english on the menu so we could hardly work out what the dishes were. The restaurant was full of families with noisy kids so I definitely wouldn't recommend it after a long flight. Locals may love this place once they know what their favourite dish is, but it's not suitable for tourists."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Awesome,positive,50,8/11/2018,"Located at the Marina it's definitely the best Chinese food I have had for a while. The interiors and the atmosphere is very soothing. The service is efficient and prompt. Loved the dim sums, especially the sea food ones. Also recommend the pork steak and the duck. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Singaporean Chilli Crab @ Stall 31,positive,50,8-Nov-14,"We went there for lunch. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawns, fried rice and fried buns which came to a total of SGD$65. Food was delicious. Very reasonable price compared to big restaurants which charge premium price (Over SGD$200 for the same meal).Definitely worth a try!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the Better Chaat Options ,positive,40,26-Jul-16,This is part of the famous Mumbai Restaurant chain and have two outlets in Singapore.We come here to eat Chola Bhatura and some chaat. The food is good and reasonably priced. Pani Puri and Pav Bhaji are the only let downs here. Be warned on weekends it is very difficult to get seating so go on weekdays. Kids love the place and we recommend this place.

I was very touched by the personal service rendered by Terry, Mum Fung and Christine. The birthday cake was placed on a big plate, decorated with mandarin greeting idiom and a handmade figurine done by Terry. I really appreciate these efforts by the team and will surely remember my 41 birthday dinner. Thank you."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",One of the best omakaze in Spore,positive,50,15-Oct-16,"The omakaze here is excellent, it's fixed set menu and the portions will blow your stomach away. Food is fresh, the signature dish is the uni with shrimps. I personally like the lobster bisque kind of dish and the beef as well. I can't describe anymore how good the dishes are until you try it. Reservation is a must and if you have to book weeks in advance with credit card being charged first, it's very normal. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Decent omelette horrible seevice,negative,10,10-Aug-15," Decided to try this new place and had to wait for 20mins until we asked a staff of we could grab a seat upstairs. Had asked for mayo for my fries but the waiter was too busy to remember the request. When another came with the dessert, we didn't have forks for the cake. Luckily the lady serving us was still attentive. They really need more training for their staff. Unlikely coming back for awhile "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Super bad experience,negative,10,1-Sep-18,Manager bad attutide. Food is not fresh. Service super bad. Its should be a happy day celebrating birthday in the restaurant in the end thanks to shin minori japanese restaurant spoiled everything. This is my first and last time will go .
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quite a bad choice for Jap food,negative,10,1-Jan-18,"I went there with my boyfriend for a casual dinner. We tried most of the items on the menu ranging from the sashimi, yakitori, udon and so on, but hardly any dish tasted satisfactory. The yakitori had a sauce on it which was extremely sweet that the dish felt like a dessert. The miso soup was bland. The soup of the kake udon was okayyy but the noodles are too soft, not sure if it is cooked for too long or what. The sushi were also just okay, i personally think places like koh grill and genki have better sushi though.. The lighting of the place is also rather dim, so it kinda brings in the sleepy feel especially after some food. Overall it was not a very nice experience and we didnt really enjoyed it. Its certainly not worth the price. "
French,Paul,Service is just to cry for,negative,10,4-Oct-15,"We did not even get to try the food. Sitting for 25 minutes before a staff member even noticed we were just occupying a table.
We could have sat the whole day there without being noticed. Not sure whether they pay their staff actually."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Nice Chinese food,positive,40,04/18/13,"This has good Chinese dishes from dimsum to noodles, etc. But it is always crowded whenever we visit so prepare to queue and wait. Staff are helpful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food - very clean place to eat,positive,40,22-May-18,Excellent selection of food in a spotless hawker centre. Went there 2 nights in a row as it was the nicest hawker centre we went to in Singapore.
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Dingy and overpriced,negative,20,21-Nov-11,"The signature idlis are indeed good though equally good stuff is available in Little India. The premises are cramped and dingy, the service staff brusque and untrained, and the prices about 50% higher than comparable restaurants in the area. Don't go upstairs because the food...More"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Specialised,positive,40,4-Feb-16,By taking one dish and making it extraordinary L'entrecote excel in what they do. No pretence in trying to go beyond their specialty make their food divine.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Excellent Range for Food Selection,positive,50,30-Sep-16,This is my first visit to the restaurant. They offer a 1 for 1 Ala Carte buffet dining until 31 October 2016 with the UOB card. Excellent range of food items for selection. Food quality and service is good. Ordered a bottle of sake to go with the meal too. Overall enjoyable experience. Will visit again! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing local food under one roof,positive,50,12-Mar-13,I visit the food court once a month or so. Love the spread and ambience. Best dish so far: BBQ StingRay.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great spot for Singaporean style seafood,positive,40,10/4/2017,"This place is really casual outdoors (plastic tables on the veranda) but it's a nice spot and very green. There are also indoor tables and private dining rooms that are slightly less casual. The food is standard Singaporean seafood fare, but well done. Quality is excellent. My pet peeve is they can never bring all the food at once even when I ask, they instead bring it when it's ready. The service is average as expected in Singapore. As previous reviewers mention, you'll be charged for everything you touch so if you don't want to pay for the peanuts, don't eat them. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still as good as ever....,positive,50,12-May-12,"Haven't been to Newton Circus for roughly 10 years and although they have done it up, all for the good, it was still sensational. The food and service were exceptional, thorougly enjoyable and we will always come back to NC....."
French,Saveur,Good Set lunch and friendly staff ,positive,40,18-Mar-18,"This place never fails to deliver good quality food and at affordable prices. This time i ordered the set lunch. Selecting salad , seabass , sencha tea. Adding on a starter portion of pasta which i read rave reviews about it... the starter pasta was quite large for me! The salad was of normal size! I was expecting a small handful of salad .. overall was so worth the price tag. And the staff members accomodating and friendly . "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Horrible place, bad services, overpriced food",negative,10,10-Jul-17,"Can't express my disgust enough without being outraged. We had really bad experience, not once or twice but 3 times. 1st time in the branch opposite Mustafa - we ordered food, waited for 25 mins, they didn't serve despite repeated reminders. Funny enough, people who came after us, ate n left, but we were still not served. Finally we gave up after 30min, and manager said ""oo we forgot your order, plz wait for a few min, we will serve"". Imagine the audacity manager had to ask us to wait another 15-20 min.2nd time in the main branch on Serangoon road - history repeated itself. Can't imagine the same thing happened again!!! But this time, i was prepared to pick a bone with manager. Finally, after 3 reminders and 25 minutes later, we were served cold curry n uncooked naan. And look at the hight of shame, manager first refused to speak with us, and finally when i spoke, he wasn't even apologetic.3rd time, again at Opp. Mustafa branch - I honestly didn't want to go in this place with pathetic service, but we had to go as the group of friends decided to go there. Substandard food was served, my friends ate it, I decided to wait and go to other place.I know my review wouldn't make a big difference as there are only a handful places serving vegetarian North Indian food, but plz do look for alternatives before choosing this place. Perhaps give a try to Panchtantra or Bikaner. "
French,Poulet,"For the price, very good.",positive,40,26-Jul-14,"Both chicken dishes are great. The pork belly is great. The tiramisu is fantastic. Each main course range from 15 - 20 dollars, and for that price the food tastes pretty good. The roast chicken is supremely tender with a stunning sauce to go with it. Highly recommended for casual diners."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Food is nice, service is lousy!!!",negative,30,6/4/2016,The food is nice with lots of variety but the waitress service is really bad. Placing order with smile to them and even by saying thank you but return you are all black face attitude.. Seem that they doesn't welcome you there to eat at all ... Haha
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Suntec L'Entrecote - What a shame....,negative,10,30-Nov-14,"In the kitchen of L'Entrecote is a man who can cook. Unfortunately, the person managing front of house has the organisational capability of a shaved monkey. It was so bad it was funny. Ordered a glass of champagne and some wine. Champagne was flat - clearly the bottle had been open for too long. we told them and asked for a replacement... answer: ""we've run out of champagne for the day"" ..? My pate and Fin's ceasar salad arrived. 15 mins later, H's soup ""was still being prepared"". We cancelled the soup and suggested our main courses come together. Mine arrived after 10 mins. No sign of the other two. 10 mins go by.... the 3 of us ate my very well cooked steak and chips and as we finished, the two burgers arrived. To make the experience worse. We tolerated service that would have caused a riot in a badly managed prison and watched two of the staff enjoying a leisurely lunch whilst the restaurant remained in chaos. Do not ever, ever, ever eat in the is restaurant until you read reviews confirming the manager has been taken in to the basement carpark of Suntec and put out of his misery."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice food and good service ,positive,50,02/15/17,We had dim sum buffet for lunch over there. The food is quite nice and The staff are very friendy. Highly recommand this restaurant for lunch and dinner.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chinatown is sooo much better,negative,10,30-Jun-11,Honestly save your self the disappointment. You will get far better service food and prices in Chinatown
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",What you get is what you pay for,negative,30,27-Jun-17,"The cuts can be better. The taste is average. It was quiet on a Saturday during lunch time, so this is not a bad place to bring children."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lovely food.,positive,50,09/21/16,"I ate here last year whilst staying at the Ritz Carlton, The food was beautifully cooked.Would definitely recommend this restaurant and I would also attend again in a heartbeat.very luxurious and great service."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good only for fast food..,negative,30,30-Jun-13,"We visited the restaurant over the weekend when its highly chaotic and crowded in Little India area of Singapore. The atmosphere wasn't different inside. It was well crowded and we had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated. Never mind. We got well seated and staff was friendly too. Well, not attentive enough as compared to what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Any ways, as we made ourselves comfortable with few sips of water, we saw the ambiance was nice but hardly noticeable in the crowd. We ordered a few snacks, followed by the main course. I must mention, its a pure vegetarian restaurant, so if you fancy Indian non-veg selection, its not for you. Talking of the food, the snacks and fast food selection is nice and would remind you of food street in India, if you have been there and tried that. As of main course, its a total disappointment and doesn't satisfy any parameter of a good fine meal. Service was below average, may be because they weren't well equipped to handle crowd. So, if you are going down to this place, my recommendation would be to try street food option on menu, like Chole Bature and Chaat. If you are out to enjoy a lavish meal, you can safely avoid it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant place,positive,50,28-Sep-10,"I have been to Singapore about 5 times and always make a point of going here and I also recommend it to friends/collegues that are visiting.I have a soft spot for this place as I went to uni in Singapore for 6 months about 14 years ago. The old Newton Circus hawker centre was bonkers. Lively atmosphere and less than impressive toilet facilities but the food was cheap and plentiful and the beer was also cheap and icy cold. All you could ask for as a student. Now I am all grown up, I made a poin of going to the new Newton hawker centre as I had read the old centre has been knocked down and moved accross the road. It is all nice and a lot cleaner, no smoking and its covered so it doesnt matter if it is raining. The toilets are a million percent better. But the food and the beer are exactly the same. Great. Dont be put off my anyone trying to make you sit at their stall. Just walk around till you see something you like and order it.We always go around stall 46 as we made friends with a guy calle Po who will do anything for you. He sits you down and you dont have to worry about anything. You order everything from him and he goes to the different stalls to arrange everything for you. You just pay the different people when they come. Satays are 0.50 singapore cents each which is 25p in UK money or 2.50HKD. Po's stall does the best stingray with a spicy and tasty sauce. The stall next to his does cheap and ice cold bottles of tige beer. Its simply great and ideal for couples, large groups of friends or families. I wish there were places like this in Hong Kong. This place makes me want to live in Singapore. Open from 4pm til 4am. Easy to get to on the MRT."
French,Poulet,Not bad,positive,40,4-Sep-13,"A friend brought me to the outlet situated at Chinatown Point. The ambience was not bad, but pretty crowded on a weekday afternoon. The lamb shank was relatively soft as compared to other places, and the roasted chicken was quite well marinated. I ended off the meal with tiramisu, that was to my delight, not too sweet and a satisfactory portion."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good value lunch buffet,positive,40,14-Nov-16,Came here with the 1 for 1 entertainer app and it was definitely well worth the trip! Service was fast and food was pretty all right for the price.
French,Saveur,Better second time round,negative,30,30-Oct-15,Didn't have a good first experience here. So was a bit apprehensive when I was invited to a private lunch event here. My apprehension was unfounded as it was a good lunch. Food was tasty & service was good. Will probably try it a third time. Hopefully it will be even better.
French,Paul,Worst experience in Singapore ,negative,10,24-Sep-15,"My husband and I met up with family here although they'd finished their meal by the time we arrived. We waited in line for a table for a few minutes and nobody acknowledged us just to say ""won't be long"" etc. we were shown to our table and decided what we wanted. I had to ask a member of staff to come and take our order as we'd have been there much longer if I hadn't. My husband ordered a tuna baguette with roasted potatoes and I ordered a pesto and mozzarella flat bread item. After some time my husbands baguette arrived. Ten minutes later the potatoes... I asked a member of staff where mine was and she simply said ""later"" I then asked why we hadn't been given a basket of bread like everyone else around us... She said ""oh you want bread"".... Well yes as everyone else has it! The bread arrived then another ten or so minutes my food arrived. The food was ok but not great. When I asked to pay the bill, the waitress handed it to me then stood over me waiting for me to pay!!! We paid and left then within about 15 minutes we both became unwell with severe stomach upsets! Neither of us had eaten anything else so I can only assume it was down to that meal! Appalling service! Expensive prices! Mediocre food! Never ever again will I return! "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Brunch,negative,30,5/9/2015,"Food was as good as expected. Crowded. Looks a bit understaffed. Though we were served, my request for a cup of cold water was not given even after I paid the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Hot hot hot pepper crab,positive,40,05/13/15,"first time come to this restaurant, we ordered a dinner set for 10ppl, size is big enough, indeed we can't finish all dishes. Black pepper crab is hot and spicy, taste fresh. Curry crab come with fried buns, dip curry, u really want to eat your all fingers. Staff are good service and very sincere. Worth to come with your business partners."
French,Poulet,Uncomplicated French lunch,negative,30,24-Jun-15,"The three things ambience, food and the services make together a great dining experience - of which service is made finitely a strong point at least for this outlet. I had poulet roti half for the lunch at sgd 15.9 and topped it up by soup and ice lemon tea for another sgd 5. The mushroom soup was good - liked the bread crumbs. The chicken came in a pool of mushroom cream sauce - slightly salty but ok to my taste bud. The half roast quantity was generous - can easily be shared. The ambience was interesting with the open kitchen - overall overpriced for local standard but underpriced from French dining perspective - overall average and uncomplicated. "
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Average Indian Resturant,negative,30,28-Aug-18,"Nothing special about the about, average food and ambiance. Squids Sambal tasted good but briyani was a big disappointment. I would also request the restaurant to add more varieties."
French,Paul,Atrocious service...,negative,10,16-Jul-13,Been here several time.. Always have a problem with service but never as bad as today when I have to walk off. I don't know whether if it's because I have 2 kids in tow that they don't take me seriously or I am not dressed to the nines like the other customers. Sat there like an idiot waiting for a staff to take my orders but they seem to conveniently ignored me and took everyone's order who came after me. Decided to leave because no matter how much waving got me no attention... 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dimsum,positive,40,02/23/14,"Situated along Trengganu Street, it is around 5min walk from Chinatown MRT. Used to be quite small, it has now expanded so it was crowded (cos food was nice). It now seems to be partner of a hotel (same lift as Santa Grand Hotel). Service was not that great but that's to be expected. Dimsum was fresh and tasted good. Typical steamed ones would be around SGD4 (eg a basket of 4 siew mai/prawn dumpling SGD3.80; Lo Mai Kai SGD3.80). They have several types of chinese tea.Overall, very nice food."
Indian,"Ananda Bhavan, Singapore",A good spot to quench the craving for typical south indian food,positive,40,1-Aug-16,"I am more of a regular to this restaurant whenever i go grocery shopping to Mustafa.Always had good experience. Not a place to hang around with friends or family , but more like a place to go to when you are hungry and looking out...More"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special,negative,30,4/1/2017,We love Yum cha and whilst what we had was OK we expected better. Yum Cha in Auckland NZ is a lot lot better quality. As other reviewers have noted the escalator is still not fixed and the entrance to the restaurant is off a side street amidst stalls up a steep flight of stairs.l;The trolleys come around and you can pick what you want. We asked for bar b cue pastries and prawn rice rolls and they came nice and hot. The har gau were OK and we liked the scallop and pea dumpling which was the highlight. We didn't like the Dan (egg) tart too sweet for us and not a good texture. A very busy restaurant with fairly impersonal service. We had to queue for over 10 minutes to pay the bill no idea what they were doing. There are much better YUM Cha restaurants than this one.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Food,positive,50,21-Dec-14,Very good and tasty Indian food. Staff is very fast and efficient. I had lunch and dined at this hotel most of the times....At this hotel you dont miss India and India food. A very good vegeterian option.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Not walking pass again,positive,50,9-Apr-18,"I walked pass this restaurant many times but didn’t find the reason to step in. Happy to have tried it this time, while looking for a place good for their chaats.I was not disappointed. It took some time for the order to come but it’s because they prepared them fresh. The good food helped the conversation to flow."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian regional snacks,positive,40,16-Apr-13,"Apart from South Indian breakfast restaurants, most Indian eateries in Little India replicate authentic Indian cuisine. Kailash Parbat, serves snacks from a particular region in India. Their branches in Mumbai are very popular and this branch has mostly maintained the standards. You have to know what to order. Skip the Pani Puri and the Pao Bhaji, the Ragda Pattice, the Chole and the chats are great. They have two outlets now, one opposite Mustafa. The staff are friendly and helpful."

French,Paul,Not bad at all....,positive,40,30-Nov-13,"Can get crowded at times. Comfortable seatings though. Staffs can be a bit slow and inattentive sometimes, maybe due to so many patrons. The food, excellent. Really enjoyed our lunch there."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",very good but also very expensive,positive,40,3-Apr-13,"Like many fine dining places in Singapore, the fitout is top notch, the service is faultless and the quality of food is usually very good. all these qualities were evident when dining at Waku Ghin. the food was delicious and very theatrical watching them prepare it all on the hot plate in front of you. the produce is fresh and the uni dish is amazing. however, there is a big price tag that comes with it. having dined at Tetsuya's in Sydney, i think it is a lot better value for money and i left feeling very full. i was not fully satisfied when leaving Waku Ghin. albeit a very different style menu at Tetsuya's compared to Waku Ghin, i prefer his original restaurant in Sydney."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,positive,40,2/3/2017,"We went here twice and enjoyed dim sum. The restaurant is usually quite crowded but I don't believe you need reservations. Lots of choices and the prices are reasonable. It is located in Chinatown. It is a little hard to find but follow the ""tea cup"" symbols which are their logo. It is on the second floor of a building."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So far food not bad n fast service too.,positive,40,30-Nov-17,More variety will be good as no soft shell crab. If can provide drinks will be much more better as price not cheap for lunch buffet.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Fine dining indeed,positive,50,10/10/2012,"Soft shell crabs, which are difficult to cook without being oily, I always regard them at a test of a true chef, and boy I've been served some horrors. Here they, as was all the food of the highest standard and truly succulent, service was creditable and we would have to give it a massive 10/10, and we never have gone over 8/10 even at our favourite comfort food restaurant, congratulations to the management and staff, they rounded off a wonderful day"
French,Paul,Poor ambience,negative,20,15-May-18,"Recently went for a family breakfast. The furniture is so old and worn out. The wooden tables are quite scratched and banged up and the upholstery is frayed on every chair. This just gives a poor ambience.Overall the food and service is okay. However, not all servers use trays to deliver drinks and handle the glasses by putting their four fingers and thumb all around the top edge of the glass where we drink from."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at restaurant,negative,30,10-May-17,Chope was easy to use but the food is normal tasting only. Ambience is okay but the table is abit small to put all buffet stuff
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very nice soup noodle and fried rice,positive,40,9/2/2017,"We're having a brunch at this Crystal Jade in Holland Village after our brisk walk morning exercises. This Crystal Jade is open from morning to serve breakfast dishes, such as hong kong styles congee and dim sum. We really like their shrimp fried rice, wantan shrimp soup noodle and a few other dim sum dishes. Ambience is pretty basic / average, with outdoor seatings. Prices are quite high though, I think little bit overpriced. "
French,Paul,Eat here if you shop at Takishamaya,positive,50,1-Dec-12,"This cafe has a nice view from the windows overlooking Orchard Road and has very comfortable furniture and pleasant decore. It is always busy and we've had to line up on occasions but it is worth it.The food is French cafe influenced with crepes. beautiful crisp bread and pastries, but also has beautiful salads with lovely fresh and healthy ingredients.You can get freshly squeezed juices or iced tea to go with your delicious salad or just go for the decadent tarts and desserts with a well made coffee. There is an excellent book shop next door if you're after something to read on your plane trip, as well as a money changer. The cafe is on the 3rd or 4th floor from memory and you can enter from the middle tower on Orchard Road."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not my best Omakase,negative,30,16-Dec-15,"3rd omakase experience. Came with high expectation because of good reviews I've heard. The sushi and ingredients were certainly very fresh, but freshness is the basic expectation of any Japanese cuisine in my opinion. In terms of artistic presentation, it was mediocre. Taste wise, every dish was good but did not bring me to heaven. Still, Hide remains top on my list. "

French,Paul,Poor Quality / Below par Service,negative,10,21-Jul-17,"The service of this Paul outlet is below par. I don't fault the service personnel but the management of the establishment for not providing sufficient training for their staff. Ordered Magret de Canard - Medium. And it came well done. Can you imagine duck breast well done? Tasted like pieces of leather. Fail. And the gratin: burnt. Another fail. The sauce, too thick and starchy; tasted more like gravy. They do dress up their failure with lots of salad over the top though. The mains were also not serve at the same time to the table. My colleague waited more than 30mins for her grill fish. No one came to inform us of the delay. Only upon several prompting did they finally serve the dish. Avoid this outlet at all cost!! "

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Anniversary Lunch,positive,40,23-Oct-16,Service was prompt and the sashimi was fresh and thick. The service staff were rather attentive and we had no problems getting their attention. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. Wished I had stomach for more.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic Place,positive,50,19-May-15,We enjoyed some real Gujju novelties at this place. Not a place if you are on a tight budget. 2 people bills will easily touch SGD50. Though taste and hygiene is of top quality.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent food and service,positive,50,08/26/16,"I came here meeting my friends last week. To my surprise, the food and service the Peach Blossoms provided us are so great even through I have been told they are very good. I would like to come back again and recommend it to my friends. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Clearly this is how Japanese food is supposed to taste,positive,50,26-Dec-14,Accustomed to sushi off a conveyor belt this experience was an eye-opening feast. One which makes me wonder about the difference in quality of produce used at chain restaurants and premium locations like Shinji. It was a treat for me and one that will certainly stay on my all time favourites list. I learned for example that sushi served with warm rice tastes a whole lot better and I learned just how good tuna can taste.So the thing that I remember best about this meal is the fact that the freshness of the produce used is outstanding. One very simple course was the tuna and white leek maki. Lunchtime omakase costs less than dinner and makes it a little more approachable. Not the cheapest experience but certainly worth it.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience,negative,30,20-Jan-18,"A local friend brought us here for a midnight snack, and it was fun with a lively atmosphere. I stuck to the ""carrot cake"" as it seemed a safe option, and it was actually really tasty (I will try to make it at home now I think). My boyfriend ate loads of things, BBQ stingray amongst others, and he raved about it although the day after he really suffered with a bad stomach upset, he thinks it was the mutton soup but it's hard to say as we were eating out lots and he eats seafood wherever he goes. So I would say eat here as a thing to tick off the list but choose wisely."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,What's not to like ,positive,50,21-Jan-17,Classic steak frites place - a complimentary glass of kir to start. They do have a menu but most people go for the salad with walnut to start followed by the steak frites - enough steak for 2 portions and as many fries as you can eat. Wash it all down with a bottle (or 2) of the house red!
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Pure Veg family restaurant,positive,50,6-Aug-18,"This is the only pure Veg North Indian restaurant as far as I know.Food quality was great, ambience is good too, good housekeeping, crowd good too. Sometimes need to wait to get the table for dinner, mainly on weekends.Kailash Parbat has to branch there in Little India, One is just under the Hilton garden inn, Serangoon road.2nd is in front of Mustafa centre.Both are good and have same food quality."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overrated and annoying touts,negative,20,16-Aug-11,"With so many great places to eat in Singapore, Newton Hawker Centre should be avoided. Lots of pressure to buy overpriced items, particularly seafood. There are many other places in Singapore where you get better food, at better prices, in a more pleasant atmosphere."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This was okay,negative,30,16-Jun-16,"I came here probably an hour or so after the lunch rush, so not many people were around and about two thirds of the stalls were closed. I definitely wouldn't characterize this as ""cheap street food""; the prices were comparable to restaurants with similar fare. I had some kind of noodley stir fry thing from a place that claimed to have ""Famous Muslim Food"". It was tasty. This is very convenient to get to by MRT."
French,Paul,Cafe,negative,30,28-Jun-15,"Godo place where to ha e a break and take a cup of coffe. Available also pastries, salad and more. Service very care and very fast."
French,Paul,Incredibly awful!,negative,10,2-Jul-18,"I know Paul from France and they usually serve good food. However, I had lunch with my son at Paul, Ngee Ann City, and it was beyond terrible. He had the ham and cheese crepe and when we pointed out to the waitress that it tasted like the cheese or ham was off, their was no reply. We told her she should let the chef know, but I honestly doubt she informed him. Also, I wrote to Paul explaining the situation - no reply! This is why I am posting my first negative review on TripAdvisor ever. I simply don’t want other travellers to be as disappointed as me."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Good food but slightly pricks you on the wallet,negative,30,25-Dec-14,"The food here at Murugan idli shop is quite tasty compared to other similar restaurants although it's a bit overpriced.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum in China town,positive,40,04/15/18,A lot of variety of dim sum to choose from. Food is delicious. But be prepared to queue for one hour. Price is reasonable.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service average. Food ok,negative,30,06/24/17,"Unable to understand... by adding order, we just need to fill in used paper forms & the service folks will know the difference. They lecture us ""There's no need to inform them"". ... Mmmm???... Super Power! p.s. The extra food filled in the used paper form did not arrive. Ha! wonder why... lolz"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing!,negative,10,6-Apr-16,"First impressions were bad when the Manageress took us to a cramped 2 seater table with a large partition blocking our view of the rest of the restaurant although it was early and the place was still empty. Ordered the buffet for 2 and fairly quickly received but can tell this food was pre-made in the kitchen. Edamame cold, chawanmushi cold, kimchi fried rice hot but it was taken out of oven coz bowl was baking hot. The sushi is the only saving grace of this place as sashimi and maki rolls are good standard. After that it was downhill once their EPOS ordering system broke down. No more food came out of the kitchen for over 45 minutes wait and table after table complaints. Manageress panicking and avoiding customers with no Plan B if something like this happens. This place failed tonight purely because of an over reliance on an ordering system and lack of contingency plan as well as weak management. One of the waiters can just laugh out loudly when it broke down and the Manageress in verbal panic mode. Seriously, you guys should not be in this business. We walked out after they offered that we did not have to pay for the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Overall, a good meal",positive,40,4/1/2016,"We had one of the set and overall the dishes are good. We had crabs cooked 3 different ways - chilli, black pepper and salted eggyork. The fish was fresh and the steamed prawns is cooked just right and juicy...just a little small for my likingRoasted chicken is good, aromaticThe fried rice (with small little fish on top) looked bland but packed quite a bit of flavor and I think there are small crunchy salted bits of fish in it tooFish maw soup was very watery, although not lacking in flavor.Had also the 4 combination starter - too salty for one dish and they are all fried, this is the lowest in my list from the meal.Veg with 3 eggs came very soupy, and I loved the soup!The stir fry veg with garlic is quite the standard fareI opted for their signature durian pudding for dessert. It is quite thick with bits of the fruit, but it was below my expectation as it doesn't give me the omph I was looking for.There was a big waiting gap between the crab and the rest of the dishes. Our plates got piled up very quickly with crab shell, but after a while the service staff got around quickly replacing them.Overall, the meal was very good as the +s are more than the misses.Will return "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,positive,50,12-Mar-17,"The quality, portion size and everything was perfect for the both of us as we love to try everything in small portions and order the stuff we like again.. Very value for money even if we were not using the bday voucher that was sent.. Shin Minori is very customer oriented, but heads up during peak times service may be a bit slower if you are rushing for time as they have many orders to process, however the waiting times were perfect for my S.O. and I to hold conversation and short break in between courses haha "

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Too famous.,negative,30,5/2/2016,"So busy we hardly saw our waiter, and they had no time to explain things on the menu. Just told us what we should order. The chili sauce was too sweet for me, and the crabs we got had no roe or innards of any kind, so they were missing the best part. Way expensive for what you get."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",very good food great place,positive,40,22-May-14,"Excellent quality food.
Great staff very helpful.
Price is decent.
Best food....has been always amazing.
Highly recommended....."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Not what it used to be,negative,30,20-Aug-16,"Went to Newton Hawker Centre for dinner. This place used to have a wide variety of very decent food at reasonable prices but now seems to be predominantly seafood stalls, drinks stalls and one or two others. Some of the traders persistently tout their stalls despite the rules against this, and others can be quite aggressive about pushing you towards their stalls. The food is pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. We had some decent satay, but the drinks (fruit juices) were watered down."
French,Saveur,Very good duck confit,positive,40,8-Jan-18,"Enjoyed their duck confit, still as good since I first tried it a few years back. Pork belly is crispy on the outside, meat and fats spreaded out proportionately. Another dish to try is the Angel's hair starter. Highly recommended for friends and families!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Brilliant Steak and Chips,positive,40,2-Feb-13,"This place is located under Singapore Tyler Print Institute and was a real surprise. I was really satisfied by the size of the steaks (300g) and the chips (free flow) were excellent. Nice location on the river, but they need to look at reducing their corkage. $30 a bottle and the cheapest wine on the menu is a average drop. We sat outside and the fans were just right."

Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great Authentic Chinese Food,positive,40,9/3/2013,"We had dinner with 4 friends. We ordered crispy pork, bbq pork, steam fish, fried kailan, duckegg battered prawns, fried rice, jelly fish. The food was awesome, pure authentic Chinese food. The service was good and the waitress was so superb that she even cover our bags with napkins so that they will not be stained in case accidentally, someone spilled the gravy on to our bags. The overall service as great. We love to dine in Crystal Jade whenever we arrive in Singapore."

French,Angelina_MBS,Horrible service,negative,10,3-Mar-18,"Went to the branch at marina bay sands for dinner. Only a handful of diners but yet the service was extremely slow. Waited 15 - 20 mins for them to take our orders despite signaling to the waiter a couple of times. They did apologize for being being under manpower but there weren't many diners ! Waiting for food being served is another 20 -30mins and my coffee wasn't even being served and we have to personal walk to the counter many times to request for the sauce which was never delivered. Settling of bill is another pain! One of the waiters whom I believe is the manager simply ignored us a couple of times by doing non important stuff like arranging cups etc at the counter. When the waiter finally acknowledged us , he went to cashier and then walked away leaving us puzzled that instead of punching in the system and preparing the bill, he walked away ... so to summarize , it took another 15 mins to settle the bill! They even billed me for the coffee which was never served! Overall experience was unpleasant and horrible! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome!,positive,50,21-Apr-15,"A bucket list eating experience! It's hot, sweaty, busy but the atmosphere and the food are incredible! Three meals, six drinks, £15. Made on the spot, fresh ingredients and right in front of you, there is something for everyone. Plastic tables and chairs, communal sitting areas, your place is marked by putting a packet of hankies (bring your own!) and putting at a table. Filled with local people, queues at each of the stalks, freshly squeezed juices, ice cold Tiger beer, and not a McDonalds or Nandos in sight! Bliss!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great food,positive,40,12-Feb-13,"Great food for a special occasion. The chef was able to accommodate to some special diet requirements e.g. No beef, etc. Dessert was served in a lounge overlooking the bay offering a fascinating view. On exit, one gets a even more fascinating view of all the filled up gaming tables at the lower floors!"
French,Paul,Good food albeit slightly pricey,negative,30,24-May-15,"My colleagues and I went to the Paul branch in Takashimaya for a quick dinner. We ordered the tapas plates (beef, shrimp and avocado and chicken) and one pastry (hazelnut croissant if I'm not wrong). I found the shrimp and avocado tapas as well as the hazelnut croissant absolutely delicious! Service was mediocre though. May need to come back to try a heavier meal."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hungry to have Indian pure Veg Chat items......,positive,40,5-Dec-14,"Needless to say, if you want to have Chat items having same taste of India, you must have your supper / dinner at Kailash Parbat. Yummy chat items are really mouth watering."

Crowded yet always good on service as well."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Tasty but spicy foods,negative,30,2-Apr-18,This place is just in front of Hilton Garden Hotel. Food is delicious and authentic but too much spicy. Its snacks and chats are superb.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Alaska Crab / Best in town,positive,50,10/20/17,"Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is now having their Alaska Crab yearly promotion in Oct 2017. I had two times already and going to have another 2 rounds next week. This round the promotion has to order a set course for min 4 people. It is good though because we can also enjoy other seafood such as prawn, fish and bamboo clams etc. Why so many times in a month? simply because they have the best Alaska crab in town esp. price is reasonable at SGD88 per kg - 50% compared normal price. You can choose to have white pepper or chilly or 2 flavors separately. My favorite is white pepper flavor. Lastly, Long Beach has the best Restaurant manager called Priscilla. She provides excellent service to me and my guests. We feel like eating at home. Well done Priscilla. Tip: you can upsize with additional cost and it is worth to do that because the bigger the size the better the crab meat. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Expensive and a rip off,negative,20,17-Jan-16,"Stall 82 (Lucky) served up some good BBQ sting ray with sambal sauce. They charged us $14 per butterfly prawns which was tasteless and tough after being overcooked. They had sprinkled on some half cooked garlic for flavour. Massive rip off. Stall 73 served a tasty oyster omelette but you only get a very small amount of oysters. Stall 13, the famous duck noodles was salty and the saltiness was so overpowering. Their curry char siew, nothing to write home about. So disappointing. Other hawker centres have much tastier and cheaper food. Will not come again even if it is just around the cnr from home."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli crab from Mrs Tan,positive,40,18-Apr-14,"We have been to Newton Circus many times and it never fails to disappoint. It is always clean and bustling with locals and tourists (although seems to be more locals which must be a good sign of the quality). This time (March 2014) we had chilli crab, Asian greens and Mee Goreng noodles from Mrs Tan in shop 70. Delicious!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Over-rated,over-priced",negative,20,20-Jun-12,Locals would generally eat somewhere else. Rowdy drinking crowds late at night. Watch out for over-priced seafood stalls.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Had better Japanese food,negative,30,10-Jul-17,Booked a table for 2 on a Friday night. Food choice was alright with a mix of sashimi / sushi and yakitori / grilled items. Generally portions were ok but food quality was really average. The sashimi didnt taste particularly fresh and it was hard to finish some of the items.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Not as good as the first time,negative,30,02/27/16,The duck was a disappointment this time. It tasted a bitter and was rather fat. The dim sums were good but nothing to shout about. However the custard buns were worth eating. They were uniquely baked with pandan on the outside
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Iddly Dosa Vada - South Indian way,positive,40,25-Oct-15,"Referred by friends visited Murugans Iddly shop for dinner and thank you maintaining that unique South Indian way.
Though with limited space and in waiting, worth and value for money."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Yummy Japanese buffet,positive,40,14-Aug-17,"Great selection of food, the sashimi is really fresh and they are generous with the portions. Maki and cooked food also quite decent. Only items our group didn't like were the grilled items (mainly the items on skewer) as the restaurant had grilled all items until they were too dry! Sometimes food came slower as it got busier but still ok.Star items: sashimi, grilled salmon, unagi items."
Indian,"Murugan Idli Shop, Singapore",Consistent quality,positive,40,4-Mar-18,"Earlier this restaurant was in a small space.
Now they have moved to a bigger space.
Food quality is consistent.
Service is fast.
During rush hours service is lacking.
It would cost 10 sgd for a wholesome breakfast per person.
Good place for South Indian...More"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Mouth watering,positive,50,18-Jun-15,Had the Omakase set for $250. It was worth it. Had a few reviews saying that it is the best outside Japan and I have to agree that it is the best sushi I have ever tasted (excluding the ones in Japan since Ive never been there).Staffs are friendly and will ask if you have any allergies prior to serving you the food. The chef will explain what sushi he prepared for you. Reservation is recommended. Did my reservation using e-mail so the restaurant is quite efficient.Will definitely come back here again.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great Birthday Treat!,positive,40,24-May-17,"The only thing missing was the inclusion of non-alcoholic drinks & a dessert in the Buffet price. However, that way, at least we got to sample even more of the lovely variety of items available.??"

No wifi - although the signal is strong but it was not available to diners. Sashimi was not fresh, just edible. other dishes are mostly average in taste. Tight table arrangements. "
French,Saveur,Average food and setvice,positive,40,13-Nov-16,The food is a bit salty. Waitress who served us put on a smile. When come to food serving...not a single staff ask us whose food it is. We have to swap ourselves.
French,Paul,Sit and Relax,positive,50,1-Jan-18,"I have been to many PAUL outlets. In Westgate, Paragon and Takashimaya. Its a dessert heaven. They serve very good food and good service as well."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food for an inexpensive meal,positive,40,09/18/12,Food is very good and good variety of choices for dim sum. Very busy during lunch though. Breakfast and tea time is better
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker centre to avoid if you can,negative,10,15-Sep-11,"This place is more for tourists and locals will avoid if they could. Foods are so-so and pricey. You have other better hawker centres elsewhere than this, where foods much tasty, better and cheaper.Hawkers here when they see locals walking in, they do not bother, knowing that they cannot ripped them off unlike tourists. So tourists be warned.If you wanted to try local foods, there are many hawker centres around the island, that sell the same things what Newton centre offered. You do not need to come here to try.Chances of tourists getting ripped off here is high, which has been proven on newspaper."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Excellence food, service and ambience",positive,50,11/16/15,"Peach Blossoms has always been one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. Not only the foods are awesome, the services are great too, especially staffs like Nobel Chang, Sook Teng and Hui Hoon. Thanks to them for making us felt very warm when ever we have our meals here. We always bring our overseas friends here whenever they come too. Thanks to the chefs for creating such nice foods. We'll continue to patron Peach Blossoms."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful local fare - fabulous fruit,positive,40,2-Jan-13,"We went for an evening meal here courtesy of a local Singaporean couple who we had met several times over the years. We had never eaten at a Hawkers Market away from Orchard road. The food was wonderful, our hosts treated us to a selection of local dishes in this bustling location. I would visit again on our own but would not have been too confident going there for the first time without local company. I didn't know most of the dishes and there are touts who try to push menus, if I had been alone I would have thought they were waiters of some sort! Be firm and a bit wary of being taken advantage of and it is a great place with great food. The fruit stalls on the outer rim of the Market were incredible, selection, quality and quantity - on our next visit it is firmly on our list of places to eat."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Great food, wide selection",positive,50,18-May-17,"Wide selection of both cooked Japanese and raw (Sushi/sashimi) offerings. The seaweed salad is a must try. Me and my friend had double helpings, he had triple."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Disappointment with the ""new Menu C"".",negative,30,10/28/14,"I decided to celebrate a birthday at this venue and selected their “newly created dishes menu, ” Set Menu C. This entitled me and my guests to a private dining room.The room, situated at the end of a long walk through the restaurant, was small, simple in decor, carpeted, sufficiently cold and had good lighting; with thin sliding doors and walls, so that the noise from guests in the other rooms was very audible. Service was attentive and efficient. Below is the list of dishes that came in descending order:Long Sheng live lobster: Each person was served half portions; the lobsters covered in buttery batter. Meaty and rich and had quite tasty flavors. Chili Crab. Crabs in generous amount of tasty tomato-based sauce with the aromas of curry leaves, flavorful and very nice with two plates of fried buns to lap up the chili crab sauce. Buns are additional at $5.50 each plate. Live Prawns in Japanese Sake. We found the presentation unappetizing, looking like the prawns were simply tossed on the plate. The prawns, medium-sized bordering on small, were over cooked, the flesh sticking to the prawn shells.Famous Pepper crab, hot and peppery. One of their signature dishes and a favorite.Steam Live Sea Bass in Lemon Thai style. The fish was very fresh and the meat firm. Strong lemon flavors which I found refreshing. La La King with dried shrimps and chili padi: was a ‘small dish’ in terms both of edible quantity of meat and clams for 10 persons. The sauce tasted similar to the chili crab sauce minus the curry leaves, and the clams tasted fresh.Handmade Bean curd with Chef’s Sauce. The dish was nicely presented, but there wasn’t that Wow! factor to make it outstanding. The sauce was thin and gooey, and wasn’t tasty. A dish that could be missed or skipped.Crispy Duck. We had a huge fat duck, plenty of meat and crispy bits. Fried to perfection. The meat was not dry or too saltish.Country style Brown rice noodles: We found this very saltish. It was compounded by the salted dried shrimps bits making it even more saltish! Not many of us could finish the portions we had.Desert Mango pudding was served individually. It caused a stir because of the presentation in glass vessels containing dry ice in green water, billowing white smoke as the dish was laid on the table! However, the pudding itself was a huge disappointment. Dry and too firm in texture for a pudding. The taste was unremarkable. It was a struggle to finish our deserts!The two plates of appetizers were charged $6.00. Because we had 11 persons and needed an additional lobster, there was an addition of $56.00 for this. The Set Menu C was packaged at $768.00 ++. There are also charges for tea and towel with the usual Service Charge and GST.Generally, a pretty heavy meal, with six out of eight on sea food dishes. I would prefer next time, to go with an ala carte order. There are other sea food dishes in their menu that have been time tested and found to be favorites. This menu could do with a vegetable component and some of the dishes in this new “ Set menu C.” needs, in my opinion, further work to improve on.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good but not great,negative,30,11/13/11,"The restaurant was up a hill, not easy to find, even for a local taxicab driver. I had chili crab which was quite tasty but nothing extraordinary to justify the expensive cost. The service was brisk but unfriendly.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab rules!,positive,40,5/2/2016,Long Beach is a well establish local seafood restaurant and their Dempsey location is designed to be more upscale than their original place. The service is good and the location is easy to get to in the city. We had wonderful pepper crab which is my favourite dish. We also had a very good fried pomfret fish. Good place for local seafood when you visit Singapore. I actually prefer it to their beach location.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good but overrated,negative,30,5-Apr-14,"There are so many stalls to choose from so you have to look around to make sure you pick the right one. After you order and pay, the food will be delivered to your table (you have to get a table first and note down the table no.) Food here is OK so-so but what you get is the variety and the experience of being in a hawker-centre environment. Plus it's cheap! Worth a visit."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Don't like new menu layout ,positive,40,04/18/15,"It's our regular haunt every month and we've seen this place grow from start till today.Crystal Jade in Holland Village has gone through several changes over the years from changing their fresh dimsum to frozen and the latest 3rd menu change (which seems the most confusing).The food is the same good quality, albeit the menu needs some more thought. We were both turned off enough to lose a bit of appetite just making sense of it.We ordered their Braised Brinjal and Minced Pork, Deep Fried Salted Egg Prawns and Shrimp Wanton Soup.....the Salted Egg Prawns, the prawns separated too easily from the batter...... and rice wasn't too fresh tastingService slowed down due to new service staff. They need help."

Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$250 w/o tax for an AWFUL lunch Omakase! ,negative,10,27-Jul-14,"Was too excited when I got Shinji's reservation, been hearing really good reviews about this restaurant. I learned it the hard way. Shinji is a rip off. For $250, without tax (almost $300 with service charge and tax) we got the lowest quality of fish, maybe it was not my lucky day?? Or they thought ""Indonesians will pay anyways, they don't understand"" oh heck yes, I DO! We didn't even get chutoro or ootoro, and only 2 bites of Uni (a sushi and a dish). So what's so good about this restaurant? Maybe the one in St. regis is better? Never coming back. Awful awful awful omakase experience! Save your money and go to tatsuya, you won't regret it! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Best Japanese,positive,50,18-Apr-14,"We had the 'middle' sized menu, lots of different mouthfuls of all sorts of things! The guy doing the slicing spoke pretty good English and explained it all as we went along. Puddings delicious as well. There was a lot to eat so make sure you are hungry when you go!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab.... more more more,positive,50,05/22/13,This was a recommendation from someone who eats here regularly. Thank you so much. Get a cab and visit when in Singapore or if like us you are on a stopover between flights. Chilli Crab and Black pepper crab to die for. The wine list is not bad and if you are staying in a Singapore hotel will seem like a bargain. Will stopover again.
French,Poulet,Tasty. French Flavors in Chinatown,positive,40,26-Sep-13,"After feeling like something other than Chinese food we literally stumbled upon Poulet in china Point mall. The food was tasty, reasonable size and well priced. The staff were very friendly and we returned a few days later they remembered what we had ordered earlier. They changed a dish for one of our group who had special dietary needs. If you feel like a change when surrounded by a Chinese food give it a try."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",There is some areas of improvement,positive,40,29-Mar-17,"Overall the dining experience as a whole was amazing but it was just the ordering of the food as well as the duration to wait for the food to arrive was pretty slow. An example was like I ordered 3 glass of ice water and it took a good 10 minutes to be send to my table. Other than that, food quality was excellent!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful Birthday Celebrations at Peach Blossom!,positive,50,10/20/16,"I had the pleasure of celebrating my mother's 68th birthday at Peach Blossom with my family and we had a fabulous evening to remember. As always, Peach Blossom delivered on its reputation as one of the finest Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. We ordered a set dinner for 5 and the food was scrumptious and servings plentiful. The icing on the cake was clearly the service level delivered by the restaurant staff. Terry and Nobel were warm, delightful and made us feel like royalty. Thank you for such a wonderful celebration!"

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Best Japanese Buffet,positive,50,17-Nov-17,Good selection of Japanese food at this ala carte buffet. The yakitori especially was really good. The sashimi was really fresh. Would have been even better if other drinks and dessert were included.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste Inconsistent,negative,30,8-Jan-14,"I believe this place has undergone some rapid change in staff, including the chef and manager. While the service staff are generally nice, the change in chef was a huge disappointment for a period of time. Food taste and quality went down drastically; to the extent that we thought that the food served was spoilt. Before that, I used to go down there almost every Saturday and Sunday for brunch. After a long hiatus, I decided to try them out a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the food tastes really good now. I wish this consistency is maintained. Ambiance is quite good and the place is easy to locate. My suggestion is to try the restaurant neat the temple and not the one behind Mustafa."

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad experience ,negative,20,6-Apr-16,"Very disappointed the moment we were sat on a miserable small table at 1 corner though we arrive early n the restaurant was still empty. We had buffet n every order took at least 20min to come which is quite ridiculous. Next problem the samsung pad ordering system was down and no one came to assist us til we manage to catch hold of 1 waitress to help us do manual ordering. I think the manager is doing a great job to lead the team instead trying to avoid customers to avoid problem?? I would definitely not reccomend any of my friends here, seriously is the worst Japanese restaurants I have been so far. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice dinner,positive,50,11/26/17,"Service was excellent! We called to ask about the parking and were given very good instructions.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fantastic experience with Razor Clams, Black Pepper Crab and Sea Bass Penang style",positive,50,02/20/18,"I can't say we are easily impressed with food, but today the food was wonderful, different flavors, spicy, but not too spicy, and very well seasoned. The Black Pepper Crab (S$ 71) is what they are known for and for a good reason, but the razor clams (S$ 16/each) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass Penang style (S$ 41)! Also the fried rice with dried scollops (S$ 18) was light and very good texture. Even the Spinach with Oyster Sauce (S$ 18) was very tasty. Of course a glass of Tiger draft (S$ 6.90) helped to cool the spice :).When eating the Black Pepper Crab, ask for gloves and a pick, as well as a bib to keep from splattering on your clothes! It comes out piping hot.Service was very good, and afterward we asked for a cab, which they called for, and it was here in less than 5 minutes.Definitely, for first timers to Singapore, and most experience dinner."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Great Dinner,positive,50,18-Aug-15,"I tried Tetsuya in Sydney many years ago and that was memorable. I heard a lot of great reviews about Waku Ghin, I visited, and was not disappointed. The restaurant was nicely decorated , the food was excellent ( nothing too fancy ) and the services were top class. I liked to bamboo clams and steak most in the tasting menu, but truly , everything else was well executed. Thanks again, chef Tetsuya."
Indian,"Muthu's Curry @ Dempsey, Singapore",Good Food Good People,positive,50,17-May-15,"Don't understand the reviews about bad service. We found it very prompt and friendly. Had a great meal!! Very interesting building and just perfect. We were looking for a different Indian restaurant, but we so happy we stumbled upon Muthu's Curry."
French,Paul,Comparing to Paul in Paris,negative,30,26-Oct-15,"Been to Paul in Paris and thought just give this one another shot. My second outing to this outlet, first time was when they had the French crew running operations assisting the local guys during their launch and food was replicated superbly well but now I felt it is not as great. Service was struggling to cope but then again it's about the same at some other establishments. Sorry to say this but I'll stick to Paul in Paris. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,positive,40,9-Mar-15,"Access easy enough via MTR (as long as you come out of the station by the right exit!)Good variety of food, the main benefit being that you can order from one person, and he/she sources the food for you, so you do not have to visit loads of stalls.Make sure you pay for your drinks only once, as we had the feeling we had paid for them with the food, only to be presented with another bill!"

Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely no sense of occassion,negative,20,29-Jan-11,"We dined at the restaurant in October 2010, with great expectations. Perhaps I should have taken it as an omen when there appeared to be a question on whether we had a reservation. The night duly arrived and off we set to Waku Ghin. As we were aware the restaurant is in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex..... which is partially opened and devoid of people at 8:30pm.The maitre'd is English and is rather frosty in his greeting. We were shown to the private room which is a teppan grill with seating for 7 people and there we waited and waited and waited for 30 minutes before it was suggested that we may wish to have a drink. We ordered some San Pellagrino and perused the wine list. The wine list is excellent and really show cases Australian wine. It is a shame that the pricing is ridiculous considering the GST and service charge have to be added.Finally after the chef peeking through the door several times and the other guests had arrived, the food preparation begins. There were 2 chefs preparing the food that night and it seems that the chefs do not start until the teppan grill is full which begs the questions why not synchronise the patrons to the same time instead of 3 separate groups arriving over 30 minutes?The several courses duly arrived and whilst the ingredients are the freshest available none of the courses are outstanding in fact some are outright disappointing the abalone for example is tough, the Wagu Beef is a a mere morsel. Pity the poor 15 year old dining with his parents alongside us, he must have been starving at the end of the meal.During the meal one of the waitresses decided to open the sheer curtain to improve the ambience, it was delightful the Chanel neon sign lit up the entire room! She drew the curtain very quickly.In conclusion we paid approximately $S1280.00 for this experince. Both my partner and I felt flat at the conclusion of the evening. Neither of us could believe we had spent such a large amount of money and felt nothing. We have dined in some of the best restaurants in the world and this is the only restauarant where we have experienced an evening such as this."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",excellent veg indian food,positive,40,4-Jan-14,"this place is very close to Mustafa on syed Alwi road. There are many other indian restaurant around. Place is generally full. Had dinner twice at this place. Excellent food. You can get many snacks items like bhel, sevpuri, gulab jamun, samosa, sandwich etc also along with the regular vegetarian items in a restaurant. Food - quality and taste wise is excellent. Service is excellent. Staff is great. we tried north indian food and really liked it.This restaurant is visited mostly by Indian tourist and Indians staying in Singapore."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very Japanese,positive,40,16-Dec-15,"We began with a chilled soup of Japanese sweet corn with Australian winter truffles and saffron ice cream. The flavour of the corn came through nicely in the soup, not being too sweet, and the saffron ice cream avoided the strongly metallic taste that saffron often brings; the truffles were not overly aromatic, but they added a pleasant additional and subtle fragrance to the soup (17/20). Next was a dish I recall from earlier visits to Tetsuya, marinated botan edi (a large Japanese shrimp) with sea urchin and osetra caviar, presented in a hollowed out sea urchin shell. This was an attractively presented dish that had excellent quality sea urchin and good prawns, the saltiness of the caviar balancing the richness of the sea urchin, and the prawns giving a different textural element to the dish (18/20).The teppan grill came into play for the first time with the next course, with pan-fried fillet of ayu (sweet fish) on a bed of daikon and fennel. This was a very simple dish, and although pleasant and in season, the quality of the ayu was not in the same league as several I have eaten in Japan, where considerable effort goes into ultra-seasonal sourcing (in some cases the fish is sourced from different places according to two week mini-seasons, ensuring the absolute peak of quality). Still, this was a perfectly enjoyable dish 16/20).Next was Alaskan king crab, steamed under a copper pan on the grill in front of us on a bed of sea salt, served very simply with lemon scented extra virgin olive oil from Italy. This was a dish with nowhere to hide, and the cooking technique was faultless, the crab cooked exactly right, the lemon adding just a hint of acidity to balance the crab (19/20). Next was abalone from Tasmania, grilled and served on a bed of fregola and tomato. Although the abalone was good, again I found it less so that some of the remarkable abalone I have eaten in Japan (such as at Ryugin in Tokyo), though the Mediterranean accompaniments worked well enough (16/20). Canadian lobster was next, simply braised with a tarragon stock with a little paprika cream and a shellfish sauce using lobster shells and reduced for several hours. The lobster was lightly cooked, avoiding the chewiness that so often happens with this ingredient, and the light scented stock was a harmonious accompaniment to the shellfish (18/20).There was now an interesting contrast of two beef dishes. First was a tenderloin of Tasmanian grass-fed steak with mustard made from wasabi grown in Tasmania. This was also served with freshly grated wasabi from Japan. The beef was of excellent quality, lightly cooked, but the revelation to me was the wasabi. In the west we are used to being served ""wasabi"" that is in fact horseradish with green food colouring, which gives a simple one-dimensional heat. I have had real wasabi many times in Japan, and this delivers a much more complex flavour, an initial burst of spicy heat followed by a less spicy flavour, with almost a creaminess of texture. Wasabi comes in many different grades of quality, and the one tonight was of the highest standard, displaying a lovely complex set of flavour notes (19/20). I found the wasabi almost more interesting than the excellent beef. Immediately after this was grilled wagyu beef (grade A5) from Omi prefecture in Japan, aged for just over three weeks. This was heavily marbled with fat and had the rich flavour that comes from that degree of marbling. As with much wagyu beef, it ca be so marbled that you almost forget that you are eating beef at all, and this was the case tonight. This was served with more of the lovely grated wasabi and also maitake mushrooms, with a little citrus soy as a garnish; it is more a preference than anything technical, but I actually preferred the grass fed Tasmanian beef tonight (18/20). To finish the savoury courses was a dish of rice on which was placed a little flounder, which was then immersed in consommé. The chicken consommé was superb, clear and with lovely clean aromatic flavour, nicely complementing the fish (easily 18/20). Dessert was served in a separate room next to the wine storage area, with a view out over the water. Granita of Kyoho grapes (a variety from Jaan) was superb, the texture of the granita spot on and the grapes having excellent flavour (19/20). Japanese white peach was seabed on a bed of champagne granita, and although the peach did not quite have the perfection of some I have eaten in Japan it was certainly lovely, ripe and with delicate flavour (18/20). Finally, a little lemon curd cheesecake was excellent, and even better was a rich chocolate mousse made with Valrhona chocolate, with velvety texture (easily 18/20)."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family Birthday Celebration,positive,40,8/7/2017,Our family's favourite haunt for good seafood. We like most of the dishes especially the black pepper crab and Lala Horfun. It has free parking but remember to make reservations because it is always fully booked. Private rooms are available if you spend above a certain amount. 
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Pricey but worth the experience,positive,40,8-Oct-14,"Our favourite meal in Singapore. Ever. Yes, it's expensive, but you get over it and realise you just had an out-of-body experience of raw (and perhaps blow-torched) fish. We were awed by the chef's before we even tasted the food. Then we ordered and ate. Then we told the chef to serve us whatever. It was awesome experience."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great Set Dinner,positive,40,25-Apr-17,Set Dinner was very good and value for your money especially the smoked salmon salad. The croissant was great as well as the desserts though did not fancy the mont blanc dessert.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Stick to Din Tai Fung,negative,30,10/4/2015,"When I googled yum cha, this place kept coming up and the reviews were really good. Well I was really shocked that it would be so popular! We queued for a while and even though the restaurant wasn't full, it took a while for someone to take us to a table. We asked for the peanuts to be taken away as didn't want to be charged for something we didn't want. After all, we wanted to save room for delicious dim sum! Well what a disappointment, in a nutshell, they weren't super hot, the dumplings were bland and tasteless and I have had far better in other countries! The restaurant is also really noisy due to the wooden flooring, and we will never return. Din Tai Fung is far cleaner, better service and their dumplings are far more delicious!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Celebrations and desserts,positive,40,15-Jan-18,"I was a little disappointed as they do not have anything special for an actual day birthday celebration.A slice of cake for the birthday person would be a nice gesture. Nevertheless, we ordered a slice of cake and they provided the candle.The dessert and cakes were ala carte orders, not included in the buffet menu, yet the cake did not taste fresh.Other than these, the service and food were great!Will still recommend them for the Japanese buffet. There is a good range of varieties to choose from. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful food,positive,50,10/18/13,"This is an excellent restaurant with wonderful Chinese food, with a more modern approach and dishes you rarely find in other countries. Although this is in an expensive hotel, this was very reasonably priced provided you do not choose wine."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The kind of place you'd like to get crabs.,positive,40,8/8/2014,"Singapore's famous Chilli crab is something you have to indulge in. It is spicy, it is messy, it isn't the cheapest meal out but it is worth every dollar, especially here at Longbeach @ Dempsey, a wonderfully transformed colonial building in lush surrounds. A great laid back spot to watch the live crab tanks, enjoy some cold Tigers and mop up Chilli crab goodness with delicious, sweet fried buns. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nothing special ..,negative,20,01/22/17,I have been brought to this restaurant in Chinatown twice by 2 different tour guides so I assume that it must have been popular and good at one time. However on both occasions the food was a letdown and the ambience very average. So I don't understand why the tour guides keep bringing us here. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it,negative,30,2-Oct-17,"The dishes are terrible, does not match the pictures. Also the addition of random sauces on the various dishes spoil the taste. Portions are always inconsistent."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Superb japanese at astronomical prices,positive,50,8-Jan-14,"If you happen to be in Singapore, and you happen to gamble, and you happen to win BIG, then go to Waku Ghin! Upon entry you are guided to a small room with bar stools and a teppanyaki grill, seated down and introduced to the chefs (if you're friendly then you'll also meet the three or four other diners in the room). After asking about allergies and dietary requirements, the chef will then display the nights offerings (most of which are likely to jump at you). The most memorable dish for me was the abalone. It was cooked to perfection, and required no sides - this is surprising considering my hatred for abalone!The only disappointment was the Uni (the only other food that i have never enjoyed). Having said that, this was the best that i've had so far - outside of japan, and the combination of flavours with the saltiness of the caviar was excellent. I would definately recommend this restaurant. An added bonus was that our chef was extremely amusing and very charismatic, only adding to the experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",First visit,positive,40,25-Aug-17,"First visit. The food was good, varied but not much seafood choices. Will revisit for food. Nothing outstanding for service and atmosphere.."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A French fast food restaurant,negative,20,10-Jul-14,"We dined at the Suntec city restaurant. It took them about 5 min to serve our food after the order was taken. Seems like the food were pre-cooked. We had the Onion soup which was lukewarm and bland, tasteless pasta salmon, think slice of steak which was not worth the price ($29.90) - was cooked medium well when we requested for medium rare, Escargots and Salad Nicois. It seems that they were in a hurry for us to finish our meal even thought there were only few diners. Before I could finish my soup, the salad was served. Service was really poor. And for a French restaurant, they do not even have a soup spoon. It was a bad dining experience."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L entrecôte,positive,50,3-Jan-17,I booked the restaurant last minute but they were very accommodating. French onion soup and steak was very good
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A real dining experience,positive,50,24-Jul-14,Having eaten in many Japanese restaurants in several countries (all outside of Japan) I have to say this is the best. Not only is the quality of the sashimi and sushi next level but it's a real dining expereince. Professional sushi chefs expertly prepare each course in front of you and serve it immediately. Every detail is perfect from the immaculately kept and incredibly sharp specialist knives to the centuries old (very expensive) wooden counter and chefs preparatin boards. Even the pickled ginger and wasabi tastes better.The restauarnt is very small so a reservation is essential - we went mid-week at lunch and it was full. Consequently the sevice feels personalised and is very attentive.As for the price: it's expensive even by Singapore standards but so worth every dollar. I cannot believe anyone would fail to be impressed by everything about Shinji. A must do venue if you're keen on Japanese food and visiting Singapore.
French,Paul,New Paul at Paragon what a mess,negative,10,28-Sep-15,"Went to try the new outlet on Saturday September 26 we waited 10 mins to get a table and we waited 15 minutes and waved many times to different waitress to get some attentions and the menus and maybe our order, after 4 times of listening coming and spent 20 minutes we went away.No service attention and I guess reading many other comments from other customers quality and taste of food is not where we expect to be for a restaurant bakery like Paul...Need to improve service in each of the Paul in town"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A nice change,positive,40,3-Dec-13,Dinner here was a nice change from the Asian dining I had been doing for a few weeks. The steak was tender though a bit drowned in sauce. A complimentary glass of Kir was a nice start. The staff offered more fries. Meal comes with a green salad.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great Service, though can be expensive",positive,40,1/8/2016,"Dined here with a few friends and the service is very warm and hospitable. They allowed me to use my Mandarin Lifestyle voucher which granted me 35% off and a free bottle of wine, plus a 500g cake. However, the cake needed 3 days advance notice (which the voucher didn't mention) and I will have to collect swing by again to collect the cake in future. On first glance, the menu is quite expensive and their premium selection of teas also feels a bit too expensive, but the great friendly service really makes up for it. the staff were very attentive and were prompt in changing new plates, topping up our tea and water and were helpful in suggesting dishes and recommendations. The trio of meats were really nice (char siew, soya chicken and roast duck) and we also ordered half a peking duck which they used the meat for a fried mee sua. The crispy roast pork was also very well done and paired with the mustard sauce, was very delicious. For the negatives, in one of our dishes, home made tofu with seafood, one scallop was completely off and the waitress gladly gave us a replacement dish of prawn with wasabi mayo. That was good customer service and generous of them. In this day and age, I also expected sharks' fin to no longer be on any menu, but they still had it on as a premium item. I hope they will end this unethical dish and stop serving it in the near future. Overall, after using our voucher, dinner came up to be $35 per person and we were really full and happy with the food and service. Hence, without the voucher it would have been $50 per person and that's still a very reasonable price for fine dining chinese restaurant. We'll definitely come back!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Just when you think you had seen it all!,positive,50,14-Jul-16,"A truly unique dining experience. This restaurant has it all. Classy yet sobre interior decor. Fantastic service. Sublime food.Great desert room with Armagnacs by Darroze made specially for the restaurant and chef Tetsuya and depending on your timing, a front seat to the great MBS laser light show on every evening! From the moment you walk in you are taken care of and subjected to the Waku Ghin experience which is, to say the least, amazing and wonderful. They serve a 10 course tasting menu with emphasis on seafood. This is the most special of ""special places"" and was one of my most (if not THE most) memorable dining experiences. If you pocketbook can afford it (perfection does not come cheap!) it is money well spent for a special experience. Thank you to the entire Wahu Ghin team for a great time last night and to chef Tetsuya! Oh and when you leave, you are handed a memento-- a menu of what you have. Classy to the end!"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent despite the mixed reviews,positive,40,20-Jul-14,"Newtons was located just 2 mins walk from our holiday apartment (Orchard Scott's Residence), having read the mixed reviews on trip advisor we decided to give it a try on our first night in Singapore. The concept is really simple, choose a numbered table then order food from the many different stalls and have it delivered to that table number. The food was cheap, fresh and delicious. The first night we ate ""inside"" surrounded by the stalls, from then on we chose to sit outside close to the car park. The food was so good and the choices so varied we ended up eating from here most nights. Felt very happy to send our children to order for themselves, the stall holders got to know us and were very friendly. Paying at the table means your food is delivered promptly. Ask for cold drinks otherwise they may not be. Fresh fruit chopped to order was a lovely way to finish our meals. Try the sambal stingray, prawn noodle soup, Indian palace, and anything from the outside Thai stall. Despite the number of reviews stating you are hassled at your table we never found this to be the case. There was a polite one armed man selling wet wipe packs who stopped at each table but he was never rude and in fact we began to rely on him being there so we could buy off him. Cheap, cheerful and a great experience."

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic crabs,positive,40,07/28/14,The black pepper crabs and chilli crabs were excellent. Be sure to order the buns to soak up the generous amount of gravy that comes with the chilli crab. It gets crowded during dinner on weekends and it would be advisable to make a reservation. Pricey but superbly done and fresh.
