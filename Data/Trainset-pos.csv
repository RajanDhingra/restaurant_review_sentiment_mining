Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hit and Miss Chaat But Awesome Dal Khichdi,1,40,15-Oct-18,"Somehow Kailash Parbat's outlet in Little India doesn't get any reviews - people are perhaps posting their reviews on the other outlet. Nonetheless, this place is supposed to be your go to place for Chaat even in the streets of Little India where there are so many other options. We went there on our first night itself thinking that if we liked the place we could eat here often during our 5 day stay. But sadly we never returned because we were not completely satisfied. For starters we ordered a Sev Puri (SGD 7.5 +) and Ragda Dahi Puri (SGD 9+). The Sev Puri was spicy and delicious just like you would get in India. But the Ragda part of the Dahi Puri turned out to be disappointing - it was bland and basically boiled chickpeas - completely without flavour. We didn't eat more than half the dish and decided to order main course (which we hadn't planned to) - Daal Khichdi (SGD 12+) - which was the hero of the day. Piping hot and just how they taste in local Mumbai restaurants - it was absolutely delicious.The service was prompt. They were also kind enough to see that our kid was not enjoying the chaat and gave him a complimentary bowl of muri and namkeen mixture. Rates are slightly on the higher side for the chaat but would have been worth it if the flavours were right. A 34 SGD bill for 2 chaats and a single main course is one of the more expensive tabs you will pay in Little India."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",At times very good .... average at times,1,40,30-Jan-18,"We frequent this outlet next to the Temple in Little India and have realized that this place doesn't believe in consistency. At times their puris are stale and have a very strong stale oil aftertaste, at times the yoghurt in the dahi puri is too sour, at times their chole is bland missing the basic spices and seasonings, at times the sandwiches are inedible. Their lunch/dinner menu tells the same story. Unreliable. But the last time we were there, we were in for a treat! the pani puri puris weren't stale, chole was delicious and the paneer tikka sandwich was excellent. Everything was yummy and delicious.

We had food there about 3 times during our stay and the cost worked out to be approximately 50 SGD per couple (2 adults and 1 child) per meal. That is costly considering that we averaged 50 SGD for two couples per meal at just about every other place.Go there for a change and be ready to be left with just that in your pockets :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Taste of India in Singapore! Good food!!,1,50,8-Nov-17,"It was a solace to have found one of my favorite eateries in Singapore. It is conveniently located along the famous Little India - Belilios Road. We had the delicious Pav Bhaji, taste of which transported us to the famous khao-gallis of Mumbai. Recommendations - Pav Bhaji, Paneer Sabzi, Masala Dosa. I did have one concern, they do not provide fresh pickle tubs, they will simply pass over a pickle tub used from another table. Staff also need to wear smiles on their faces. When we placed our order the waiter was behaving as if he was doing us all a big favor.

Kailash Parbat has several stores in India and overseas. I have been to their Mumbai store several times and just love it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the menu is simply great – vast and offers everything from north Indian food to south Indian food to Indian street food to Indian sweets. The Masala chole bhature was the best I have had in years (my 1 year toddler even gobbled up few bites and was wanting more), and the Papri chaat was so so wonderful – just perfect – full of flavours. They also serve authentic sindhi cuisine – yumm dal pakwaan – very few places in the world which serves sindhi food. I might have to move to Singapore just to be able to eat here more regularly or visit Singapore more often!The price was cheap and the food was delicious and flavourful. The staff were lovely and attentive too. You are not likely to find better Indian food, certainly not at the price, anywhere in Singapore. Kailash Parbat is about authenticity and keeping it real- real good Indian soul food. My top 5 favourite dishes at KP are Pav Bhaji, Masala Chole Bhature or the Bhature Platter, Chaat Platter, Papdi chaat and their selection of lassi’s. "

A must visit place for all :),1,50,25-Feb-17,"Ambience - One of the very important things which anyone considers before going to any place, Kailash Parbhat at Imperial Hotel, sets the perfect tone for good lunch or dinner with your family and freinds!Food - This place is the one to go for any vegetarian north indian and indo-chinese cuisine! They also serve Jain food on request. The best part is that they have maintained the same taste of all their dishes which they originally started from India. Their speciality is chaat items specially Dahi Puri, Pani Puri, Chole Tikki ( The best in Singapore). Indian Chinese is the best so are their main course dishes. I personally like their Biryani. Since this chain of hotels is owned by a Sindhi, all Sindhi Delicacies are served on a Sunday!!! Trust me they are simply mouth watering and come with the same taste!!! In desserts their Kulfi Falooda and Jamun-e-Jannat (Rabri with Gulab Jamun) are something to die for!!!Service - Outstanding! Hope it sums it all.Price- Price is simply perfect. Approximately 40-50S$ for a 2 couples is a good value for money for some great quality food, ambience and service.A must visit for all Singaporeans and tourists from across the Globe!!!!"

The Dal and Jeera rice are also good. We have tried their Falooda's and they are tasty too. Chandradeo and Jyoti are always smiling and provide very good service, so we have been going there a number of times lately"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good option for North Indian food,1,40,2-Oct-16,Had been there recently during my stay in Singapore. One of the better North Indian restaurants in Little India.The chat items and Chole Bhature were good.I suppose it needs to improve on its North Indian dishes as the neighbouring Panchatantra is gonna give it run for its money...

When I visit Singapore I try a lot east Asian food, but after a few nights of eating with chopsticks, this Punjabi has to have some North Indian food and eat with his hands. The menu is very extensive, but I have only tried four things: samosa chaat; pani puri; chole + masala bhatura; ras malai. It's what I crave: comfort food from childhood. Maybe next time I will try something else. They do all of them very well. Restaurant is very clean and bright compared to most of the Indian restaurants in Little India. I will be back next time."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good Indian fare ,1,40,29-Aug-16,"After a long trip and trying out different food, felt like Indian veg food.

Four of us including two kids went there last week, we ordered quite few items like couple of veg curries, 2 assorted naan baskets, dhahi poori etc, bill was 90+ SGD. You can get the same food within 50-60SGD in other restaurants around Syed Alwi Road but not the quality. Very conveniently located opposite Mustafa shopping Centre. Note: longer waiting time during weekends, not a place for south Indian food."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",excellent food,1,40,2-Aug-16,"there are 2 locations of this. One is opposite Mustafa which was excellent a few years ago and now is consistently dirty and I refuse to step foot inside.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",best north indian food in Singapore,1,50,26-Mar-16,"I have been to Kailash Parbat on multiple occasions, and its quality has always been consistently good. The place is a hit among the indian community and I have hardly seen any empty seats.The menu has lots of options. They have indian chaat, panipuri and chhole bhature all quite good, and which you wont find in many places. The yellow and black daals served here are extremely good! Paneer dishes are excellent as well.The service is efficient and the seating arrangement has space for both small or big groups. Prices are mid-range and put to shame any indian eatery outside Little India. This is one of the best 'bang for the buck' indian restaurants in Singapore."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian street food!,1,50,20-Mar-16,"Kailash parbat is a regular for us (we are Indians) and a place where we take family visiting from home too - they never get disappointed by the authentic taste.The chaats and street corner food are the best. It being a Sindhi restaurant, would highly recommend trying Koki there (a type of bread which has spices and is fried). Bhatura and Pav Bhaji are excellent too.. With such good street food, I have tried eating the main course meals only once and decided to stick with the street food.For people with a sweet tooth, try the Jamun-e-Jannat (Hot gulab jamuns in cold rabri)We are regulars here and will keep on visiting. Prefer the Belilios Lane outlet to the one at Syed Alwi road"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian food! ,1,40,17-Mar-16,"Had been to this place during our Singapore visit of 2 days. We had dinner here both days. This is a chain of restaurant across india and the quality and standards are maintained here as well. The food is very tasty and authentic indian food is available. For those who feel homesick this is the best option. Located in little India locality, truely feels like home. The prices are a bit high but its worth it"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best place for North Indian Vegetarian Food !,1,50,16-Mar-16,"This review is based on our second visit to this lovely restaurant. Last time we had Dahi Bhalla Chaat and Chole Bhature, which were EXCELLENT ! This time, we had Corn Malai Seekh Kabaabs, and Kayberi Kadjai Paneer with a Bread Basket.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Paradise for vegetarians!,1,50,19-Feb-16,"Its a paradise for vegetarians! Truly! The food is amazing! Ambiance & staff add up to the goodness.They serve mainly north-India food. However, their starts are the highlight. Chaat, pani-poori can be eaten anytime. The price range is mid-high. but totally worth it!You will usually find queue on weekends so prefer making reservation."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good but pricey...,1,40,15-Feb-16,"Restaurants galore at Syed Alwi Road but this is a stand out vegetarian option in the crowd. Went there one evening around 5pm, hoping to get some chaat and we got exactly what we wanted. Their samosa chaat and bhel puri were excellent. My wife wanted a chola bhatura and that tasted great too! I was disappointed that basundhi was not available, but got rasamalai instead. It was a bit of a let down as it wasn't sweet enough to me. This is a good vegetarian option for those who want to taste north indian and chaat, but the prices are a bit on the higher side."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very Good Food,1,40,13-Feb-16,"We had been here a few times. The good is definitely above average, the service is excellent but I believe due to the Brand name ""Kailash Parbat"", the place is overly hyped.. Recommended to try though. Huzayf"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Food heaven!!,1,40,13-Feb-16,"Kailash Parbat is an excellent choice for Indian veggie food seekers in Singapore.

Especially
Pani puri
College grill sandwich
Food is really good.. All the products are very well served and has good quality.."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Decent food, good service",1,40,29-Jan-16,"If you wish to have decent North Indian vegetarian food near Mustafa then I will surely recommend this one. Evenings are crowded and the staff are usually quite tensed in managing the crowd. Quite often you see even the chefs struggling and the food takes time to be served. But once you get it, it's good!They used to have Arbi tuk, which was heavenly. They seem to have taken it out of the menu and sometimes reluctantly give you it's half Cousin, aloo tuk. The chaat items are extremely good and the Chef at the chaat counter is extremely kind to make them the way you want.Chole Bhatura is quite oily but who cares - it's consistently good. Bhatura and Parata platters which have three or four different types of them are quite filling for two and are highly recommended. Hyderabadi biryani and the Awadhi biryani are also quite good.Chaaz is always too salty but lassis are good. Desserts are just okay.It's a bit pricey but would certainly recommend as it serves one of the best North Indian dishes in this area. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good chaat,1,50,24-Jan-16,We r surprise to see lots of variety of chaats in singapore .we take dinner in this restaurant. taste was too good ambience is OK.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat In Kailash Parbat,1,40,8-Jan-16,"A restaurant with history- specially for chaat , chole bature and authentic sindhi food. The gol-gappe/panipuri was very good, better than in India and so was papri,ragda-patis.Also enjoyed four types of chole bature but the paneer bature was the best. The Indian curry was average but the lachha paratha was good. The cleanliness and ambiance was very good. Convenient being next to Mustafa Indian Departmental Store.Indian sweets are really very good.The price band for food items is reasonable."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Lives upto the exprectations always!,1,40,2-Jan-16,"We have celebrated many occasions - my birthday, our anniversary, took mom-dad and casual Friday lunch with office mates. And we celebrated New Year 2016 dinner here too.The place always lives upto the expectations. Amazing Chaat items - Sev Puri Chaat, Veg starters - Paneer Plack pepper. I simply love the daal makhni here. Diwani Handi was also good.Enjoyed Rabdi to the core in the deserts. It is a proper dine-in restaurant with pleasing ambiance. May appear expensive to some but it is the price for food and place.The only advice I would like to make to the management is, they need to improve the service level consistently. Train employees how to deal with situations and improve the level of attentiveness towards customers, kind advice since we are regular visitors. Hire part timers for weekends and special occasions if that helps!"

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent,1,50,8-Dec-15,Have been to Kailash Parbat in India many time and found the one in Little India to be as good as the one in India. Good options for vegetarians. When placing the order remember that the quantity is good (much more than in most places) so place an order accordingly. Food was good and so was the service. Good atmosphere. If in Little India opt for Kailash parbat much better than all the restaurants opposite Mustafa market. As they are opposite Mustafa normally one goes but Kailash Parbat is also hardly 3 to 5 minutes walk from mustafa

They serve good quality food with awesome taste which i can call very authentic as well and at quite reasonable price. They have a very nice ambience although and serve almost everything you desire for from an Indian vegetarian restaurant right from chaats to main course dishes with delectable breads (almost all varieties except missi roti which is my husband's favourite) to desserts . Their quantity is good too.We tried their kadhai paneer with tandoori roti there and it was delicious. Later we also had their ras malai which was good too. Next day we tried their gol gappas and dahi bhalla chaat which was delicious as well. Their staff is nice and converse in Hindi & English both which makes you feel that you are sitting in a restaurant in India :).

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best Gol Gappe,1,40,6-Jul-15,Kailsah parbat is one safe place to fall back to when you want excellent spicy traditional north indian food.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Top choice for Indian veg foods,1,50,13-Jun-15,"On my 4th visit I finally decide to write this review. I'm a non veg eater but this venue really impresses me and also my friends. Food: Every option is perfectly made. Such large variety to choose from. I've never eaten anything I didn't enjoy so I know the other 80% of menu will be tasty. Service: This has been acceptable. They try to come across and upmarket service but it gets so busy and staff just do a simple job. They have these iPad minis to take our orders down. So the owner is moving forward. There was even this nice aunty clearing tables often. Nice. Atmosphere: it's not fine dining. Not definitely not casual. It's perfectly in between. Nice chairs and tables. Clever paper place mats. Deseert sweets on display as you enter. Pleasant water features. Round tables. Can cater for large groups. Next door us events room. Huge kids party was taking place. Mostly busy so makes one feel the place is well liked and not just a tourist spot like some racecourse road venues. Cleanliness: the restuarant was clean. But bathroom area next door needed more attention. As said. Just busy place. Still easy to wash hands before and after dinner. I recommend to enjoy the food with your clean hands. Overall: I will always come here for my veg foods knowing it's reliable. My vegetarian guests were impressed with the food, venue and pricing was reasonable. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Like Eating in India,1,50,13-Jun-15,"We ate dinner 3 to 4 times here. It was always quite crowded. The service is slow. However, the food was great. The Sindhi chappati were soft . They helped us by making the lasunibdaal less spicy .the choke bhatura was a delight. The pani puris are expensive but yummy. The mhich Di was uninspired and mehakta basmati rice was a bit oily. Gulabjamuns were spot on Dinner is after 7 only. Overall like eating back home in Mumbai and a definite must for the Vegetarian Indian traveller. The restaurant was right behind the Park Royal hotel at Farrer park where we were staying and definitely a great place to eat. it is expensive but less than a five star hotel and with more variety."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Food! Quite High End,1,50,1-Jun-15,"Food:
Great curries. Very North Indian focused but lots of Chaat on the menu too. The curries are deep and flavourful. Quite rich but very tasty.
Service:
Reasonable but not amazing.
Value:
It's slightly pricey but it's worth the money..."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Good Chats, but on the expensive side",1,40,30-May-15,"For a gujarati vegetarian in Singapore this place is like heaven. Variety of food options and some pretty good chats.If you like cholle bhature, you should try the different variety of bhaturas served here. You would not find it at many places even in India.The staff is usually slow specially during the rush hours, so have some time on your hand when you visit the place.Overall food is good, but expensive."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian food,1,50,20-May-15,"Visited this restaurant 2-3 times during my two month long visit to Singapore. It is a fantastic place for enjoying Indian food. Variety of vegetarian food is available i.e. North Indian, Gujarati, Jain food. Ambiance is very good. Once should not miss a visit to this place when in Singapore. Service is prompt. Tourists are welcomed with a smile by the staff."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Fantastic Place,1,50,19-May-15,We enjoyed some real Gujju novelties at this place. Not a place if you are on a tight budget. 2 people bills will easily touch SGD50. Though taste and hygiene is of top quality.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great North Indian food,1,40,18-May-15,"I was impressed that they had a separate menu for Jain Food to suit my requirements. Very tasty North Indian food, and decent service, though occasionally lackadaisical. Yet, went there quite a few times during my 5 month stay and was not too disappointed."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",True Indian Food,1,50,18-May-15,This place will not let you miss your Indian Food. You will get the best quality indian food here. This restaurant is in the market area. a bit costly worth the money. Must try!!!!

The tables were placed with good distance between them and comfortable . We started with the chats which was really awesome and one of the best chats I have tasted. The main course was great as well . "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Veg Food ,1,40,2-May-15,"This is simply the best Indian vegetarian restaurant that you'll find in Singapore. Cost wise, it's $50-60 for 2 people on an average. The Dal Makhani is the best here. So is Aloo Tuk/ Arbi Tuk. Been here at least 20 times. Be assured of good food. The one opposite Mustafa is usually crowded on weekend evenings."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Very good Munchow soup,1,50,2-May-15,"We were a group of 6 people visiting Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa center. This was my First visit to this outlet. I have visited the other one near to temple on many occasions. We tried mix of Indian & chinese dishes. The munchow soup was really very very tasty. It had the right mix of hot & sour taste. After long time i had such a good soup in Singapore. In the main course we ordered paneer gravy, hyderabadi biryani and mix of roti & naan. They were all cooked very nicely. He staff was very helpful. One of us even got their mobile phone charged while we were having the meal. Our requests for hot water, pickle etc were well looked after. I also found the staff interacting with some customers who seemed to be regular on the table next to us in a very friendly manner. All my visits to Kailash Parbat have been very satisfying. I am sure to visit this place again. The munchow soup is highly recommended. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice place for Indian Food.....!!!!,1,40,29-Apr-15,"food quality was finger licking, one can get the variety of indian food as available in india....... but little overpriced."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Decent palce for family lunch/dinner,1,40,17-Apr-15,"They have turned down the heat of Indian Cuisine to serve the locals. Should improve their quality of Indian tandoors that they serve. Gravies are good, salads are awesome and the best is mango lassi."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","One of the best vegetarian food in SG - Indian, IndoChinese, IndoThai",1,40,13-Apr-15,"One of the best vegetarian food in SG with great taste. My family often visit branch in front of Mustafa, Little India.Staff is friendly and remember us. Service is also good. Customization in food possible on request.Chaat and Chole Bhature are very famous. But nowadays Bhature's are very oily.We generally order Three Pepper Paneer, Chaat Platter, Indo-Chinese dishes, Thai Green Curry and Mango LassiLittle overpriced, but ""okay"" because of fine taste.Highly recommended for vegetarians specially branch near Mustafa."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Homely (Indian) food at SG,1,40,3-Apr-15,"I loved the food options - and with my love for Indian food this was a great place for the lunch choice.
You might have a wait for a while in the rush hours. However, its worth the wait."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chaat is good,1,40,28-Mar-15,"For a long time me & my family wanted to have chaat from Kailash Parbat. We tried paani puri & Kailash Parbat chaat platter. The platter had 4 different chaats. The quantity was good enough for 2 people to share. Infact 2 of us & our 6 years daughter could not finish all the chats along with paani puri. If I remember the 4 chaats in the platter they were bhel puri, paapdi chaat, Dahi bhalla and shev puri. The taste was good. The combination of spices, puris and tomatoes & carrots was well balanced. I remember trying one of the chaat at nearby shop named Bikanerwala. It was not at all up to the expectation. Coming back to chaat from Kailash Parbat, paani puri was a bit of letdown for us. They server puri stuffed with potatoes and the water separately. We had to mix it before eating. In my opinion the paani is the heart & soul of paani puri which adds the tangy, sweet & spicy flavor to it. It was missing. Next time for sure I will give a miss to paani puri. Definitely the chaats which I have tied previously & the platter on this occasion are much better. If you are coming to expect the same taste as the chaats that you get in Mumbai or Goa where I come from, you might be little disappointed. We are used to a bit more tangy & spicy chaats. But other places where I have tried chaats they are similar to the ones available in Singapore in terms of taste & ingredients. If you are a chaat lover give a try for different chaats available in Kailash Parbat. I am sure i will visit this place again for chaats in future. "
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Impressive restaurant,1,50,20-Mar-15,"This Indian restaurant serves very good and authentic Indian food. The quality of the food is very good and the taste is amazing.

A pure veg restaurant, decently priced and good seating space. Masala tea is rocking :). During our 5 nights stay in Parkroyal on Kitchener road, this was our first go-to place for Dinner."

Service is quick, food is delicious and staff doesn't resort to rules to say 'no' as is pretty evident elsewhere in the city. Restaurant is air-conditioned and ambiance is just fine. For a sumptuous north Indian we paid around 90-100 SD for 5 adults so quite a value for money."

Will be back.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Awesome Chhole Bhature,1,40,27-Jan-15,"We often visit KP at Serangoon road (next to the indian temple between little India and farrer park MRT). This outlet is better than the one opposite mustafa in terms of ambience, quality, taste and quantity served.They serve great chat items (although only half as good as in India, but best in Singapore). Start with Pani Puri. You will love Samosa Chat. Get Apple mint juice. The best on the menu is Chhole Bhature... Different varieties of it... All are good. Tastes great with chilly and onion. After this you can try Sev Puri, Dahi Bhalla and Bhel Puri in that order. Lassi isNot bad too.Sweets / Desserts are not so great. They are not bad, but you can find better other places in SingaporeDon't miss the (free) mukhvaas/ mouth freshener upon exit."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Inconsistent ,1,40,25-Jan-15,Highly recommended for chats. But the main course was a mixed bag . Sabzee was not Upto the mark . Briyani was tasty . Worth a visit for chats
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",As good as it can be,1,50,18-Jan-15,"When you eat here, you don't miss India and that includes:1. Taste of the chaat and other food; they have retained the flavors2. Service is as good as you find in their Indian counterparts, which means that you will at times wonder where are the guys and gals who are supposed to take the order to serve3. Chole Bhature were excellent, you run 2 marathons the next day to compensate"

The restaurant was able to customise their menu to suit his taste. We took him there twice thereafter. The ambience is clean and hygienic. The food is tasty and they have very good options within Indian food. Kailash parbat is famous for its chat but I didn't try that. I tried North Indian and it was good. The staff is helpful and able to comprehend our needs. 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Hungry to have Indian pure Veg Chat items......,1,40,5-Dec-14,"Needless to say, if you want to have Chat items having same taste of India, you must have your supper / dinner at Kailash Parbat. Yummy chat items are really mouth watering."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Veg. Food Restaurants in Singapore.,1,40,2-Dec-14,"Finding good Indian Veg Food in Singapore can be a tedious job. Out of 3-4 restaurants we tried, we find this restaurant better than others. Quality wise n quantity wise if you are 3-4 persons then you can have tummy full dinner or lunch along with Pani poori or chaat within 100 SD ,above all no extra charges for home delivery if ordered from anywhere in Singapore.One can visit little India and nearby places but the strong smell of other food varieties might have confined our search for other outlets. Once finalized we relied on this and had home delivery thus saved to n fro taxi charges.Therefore one must rely on personal instincts before jumping to any exclusive conclusion."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Authentic Indian Food,1,50,29-Nov-14,"Great food, especially the khichdi is really nice. Hare Bhare kebabs are one of my favorites, Ambiance is also nice for dine in."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",MY ONE OF THE BEST INDIAN VEG. MEAL,1,50,30-Oct-14,I was here with my family on my Diwali vacation. we had gone four time to the same restaurant for our indian veg. food. It was best in Indian test and the chaat was awesome.we really enjoyed a all our meals and thanks to the helping staff. The ambiance is average and it was clean. On our special request the chef and cooked non spicy food for children and we are glad to them. located opposite to mustufa center.
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good resto for Indian food,1,40,30-Oct-14,"Being a vegetarian and Indian, my first choice was Kailash Parbat and I was quite satisfied with its food quality and taste. Pure Veg food and typically for Indians. U get good quality Punjabi food and other Indian food as well."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore","Great food, Lousy service",1,40,29-Oct-14,"Set right in the heart of Little India, kailash parbat is one of the better upmarket restaurants. I dined there a couple of times(2 lunches and 1 dinner to be precise) and the food always blew me away. It's a vegetarian restaurant so don't expect to have tangri and kebabs at this place. The ambience is good, prices are okay too but what sucks the most is the cust service. The waiters are rude, don't repeat the orders and seem uninterested in doing their jobs. We still kept going to the same place as we were dead tired after our visits everyday and did not want to experiment. P.S. - Avoid the chaat here. Not worth it."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent Indian food,1,50,28-Oct-14,The menu has quite a bit of variety.we tried north Indian food and also chaat like bhel.sevpuri.etc. the beverages like lassi.juices etc.the food was good.and reasonably priced.the place is bang opposite mustafa mall.very hygienic.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice ambience & hospitality with great food,1,40,7-Oct-14,"We happened to be in this chain's outlet in Syed Alwi Road this weekend, which was not planned for, but just stepped in. The staff were prompt to attend to us as well as offered us better seating as soon as there was one vacant, as the restaurant was quite packed. The food tasted great, we tried new combinations like Diwani Handi, Hariyali Naan. It's priced a bit on the higher side; maybe they also need to improve on acoustics of the seating area as it seems to be noisy if people around start to talk a lot..overall we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, above all the prompt fast service in spite of the flow of guests"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great food and helpful staff,1,40,6-Oct-14,Good atmosphere with mainly Indian families. Staff were helpful and good. Really enjoyed the food and would recommend to people especially vegetarians.

Paneer (cheese) Batura y Chole3. Ras Malai4. Bhelpuri.The place has no ambience. Went to wash hands..wash basin was dirty. The waiters are always in a hurry in a bid to make you empty your table as soon as one has finished eating.Prices, quite reasonable.Do I recommend? yes, especially for the deserts.Will I return? Yes, most definitely."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Enjoy authentic north indian food at Kailash prabat,1,50,25-Sep-14,"Hotel has 3 branches in the serangoon road, staff are very courteous those miss north indian home food can hop on to this hotel. fantastic taste and a clean environment, please try butter nan and paneer butter masala without fail :)"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Restaurant with good variety,1,40,17-Sep-14,"Went there with my friend and ordered a chat combo kind if thing, with pani puri and lassi. The taste was really great for all dishes. The pani puri pani was not that great. We gave this feedback and was very well accepted.
Recommended!"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Best chats and snacks,1,50,11-Sep-14,"Kailash parbat is known for its yummy chats. We tried twice on its outlet opposite mustafa centre, it was indeed delicious. Chat platter is highly recommended, they give 4 varities in platter.Also their must try is Chole bhatoore and Malai Rabri. Rabri is excellent and fresh.Worth a visit with family for quick snacks."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Good food with very good ambience,1,40,31-Aug-14,"I have visited Kailash Parbat on multiple occassions with famly, friends during different times like lunch, evening snacks and dinner. the ambience is very good here compared to many other restaurants in the surrounding areas. The service is also good. The place is nice and clean.They have the chats as well as regular ala carte menu. The staff is helpful. Once I wanted to order a Sindhi dish and the waiter was good enough to suggest that it is very spicy an unless I really wanted to give it a try, I should stay away from it.I have tried chats here. They are good. You cannot compare them with what is available in places like Goa & Mumbai. But they are one of the best in Singapore. The quantity is good. There was only one instance when I went for a dinner just before diwali and felt the service was impacted. Probably it was too crowded. Inspite of asking the waiter to serve the soup after finishing the chat, somehow soup ended on the table before the chat was served. The reason given was the chat counter was too busy and our order was still being served.I would definitely recommend this place for those people who are pure vegetarians. If you want to spend a quite evening without being disturbed in the crowded little India side, this place is good."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",vegetarian indian dream,1,50,20-Aug-14,"We returned to this little haven on a hot day.

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Chat pata chats and great food,1,50,17-Jul-14,"We live in Singapore and love Kailash Parbat. Their chats specially the Pani Puri are amazing other than the Pani Puri we will often indulge in their mouth watering Bhel puri, Samosa Chat or Alu Chat as a snack. The Chilly Paneer is also a special favourite.The helpings are large so you should share your food so that you get to taste a variety of their delicate chats and sweets. Wash it down with a cool lassi or lime juice or lime soda and that's what I would call a lovely indian snack.Meals at Kailash Parbat are excellent too and if you have the time do take the time to enjoy a good meal at Little India. The have a new outlet in the works at Changi coming up soon."

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",One of the best Indian meals I have ever had.,1,50,26-Mar-14,"Nice venue, excellent service and great value. The maitre'd came to our table and explained the slight delay as one of the dishes we had ordered, the Kebab Platter, was being freshly made, but it was well worth the wait. I cannot fault any of the dishes and generous helpings too. In fact so much so that we had to put in takeaway containers and had for lunch the next day, delicious even cold.

Specially the chaats are amazing.The main course might dissappoint you a little as compared to startes, but is again not at all a bad option to try.On weekends, there is a long queue so please book table in advance else be ready to wait. Service is slow given high rush of footfall, but they will keep your cool with their warm behaviour.Average meal for a couple costs SGD 30-40.In all, a must try for all vegetarians."

KP brings in authentic north Indian taste for you. Staff wears a smile and often give you freebie starters, of that you have to be a regular by the way ;)Chole Bhature, Baby Corn Basket Chaat and Biryanis are a much try. If you wish to have some thing light they do serve sandwiches and snacks through the day. The only down side is you may have to wait a bit during weekends to get a table. Keep hogging..:)"

I just had a Bhatura but tell frankly could not finish it... The only problem i faced was they did not accept travel card saying they accept only on bills above SGD 20 or more and my bill was SGD16.80.. They should think over that policy as i was all alone so there is never be any chances to get it over SGD 20... Shall come again sure next time come to Singapore... :)
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Great Indian Vegetarian Cuisine - pricey,1,40,7-Sep-13,"Go to Kailash Parbat for an authentic indian street food experience in a restaurant setup. Chaats and paani puris are really nice. But my favourite remains the chole bhatura and gulab jamun. A must try for each visit.Dinner for 2 costs about 30sgd++ Service is prompt. I was impressed that the manager cleaned the table when he noticed his cleaning staff were quite busy. Food was served within 5-10 minutes.The ambience is average. Though yhe interiors are done nicely, it doesn't g8ve a traditional Indian feel. Also, I personally found it a but noisy (enough to drown the background instrumentals that I like so much).Overall, a place for authentic indian street food with good service. But pricey and mildly noisy."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Excellent but pricy!,1,40,20-Aug-13,Try the chats! It's the best u will get in singapore. Also the dinner items are delicious! A bit pricy when compared to other nearby hotels. Try the lassi as well. 2-3 plates of chat n lassi itself can cost u around 30-40 sgd!!! Good to go occasionally!! 
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Takeaway,1,40,30-Jul-13,We picked up Papri chats as a takeaway and four plates set us back about 33 Sin Dollars. The portions were very generous and the taste delicious.The restaurant itself is quite large

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Home FOOD Away from HOME,1,50,27-Jun-13,Kailash Parvat is a home kitchen away from home for all those Indian travellers who can adjust anything but cannot compromise on food.The best place to dine in 3 times a day to have a tastier experience.The whole staff ambience and food qualtiy is excellent.The taste is much much better than many restaurants in even India.I dont think one should try different places if staying long Infact u must repeatedly have all ur food requirement from here only leaving your fooding tension on Kailash Parvat .

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian regional snacks,1,40,16-Apr-13,"Apart from South Indian breakfast restaurants, most Indian eateries in Little India replicate authentic Indian cuisine. Kailash Parbat, serves snacks from a particular region in India. Their branches in Mumbai are very popular and this branch has mostly maintained the standards. You have to know what to order. Skip the Pani Puri and the Pao Bhaji, the Ragda Pattice, the Chole and the chats are great. They have two outlets now, one opposite Mustafa. The staff are friendly and helpful."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",North Indian Street Food Favourites - Good food but not so reasonable,1,40,16-Apr-13,"If you want to savour typical North Indian street and junk food favourites - this is the place to go.The selection of ""Chaats"" is very good and the 'Methi Chola - Bhatura' was amazing.Go with a good appetite though - you will feel so full afterwards that you will want someone to drag you home!.I had a small issue with the mango lassi which was sour due to the yogurt sitting out for too long. It was replaced immediately with another glass which also was sour. The friendly staff offered to compensate me with complimentory dessert which I declined as I was already bursting at the seams!.Good fun sunday brunch hangout."

The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable, the decor is pleasant and the service is pretty good (in a country notorious for horrible service). Neither my husband nor I are vegetarian, but the food is so delicious we didn't miss the meat. If you've never tried Indian vegetarian food (I'm new to it myself), I recommend the Papdi Chaat, Pani Puri, Tandoori Tokri, Khyberi kadai paneer, Lasoni dal tadka, Tarkari mandi."

Nice joint if you cant stay without Indian Food"
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Indian Fast Food at its Best!,1,40,5-May-12,"One of the better restaurants in Singapore serving variety of Indian Fast Food options (Chaat). From Delhi to Mumbai to Gujarat to Sindh...you have it all. And you will be surprised by the authentic flavours and taste. However, stick to safe options like Golgappe, Aloo tikki etc. New exotic options like (Masala Chhole Bhatura) could disappoint you.Range of sweets and beverages is also satisfying.Only downside is price...but should be okay for your desi craving.Note: They also have outlets in Mumbai & Hyderabad. Hyderabad (Inorbit Mall) was too disappointing...to say the least."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Punjabi food with Tang ;-),1,50,17-Apr-12,"Though prices are going north here too,this is one place i visit atleast once a month.With family or friends.The staff is very attentive,warm and knowledgable.During Navratra-i was fasting the staff cooked lotus stem with for me with just seasoning.Felt like home.The pani-pooris, chaats, Bhaturas, weekday buffet,Samosas or the sweets, all are just awesome.The restaurant keeps the quality under check which makes my friends/relatives from various parts of the world make atleast 1 visit every visit mandatory."
Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Sindhi Treat,1,40,24-Feb-12,I was surprised to find the Sindhi delicacies that too with authentic taste. I feel it's better than the one in Mumbai. Service sometime suffers during peak hours but overall a very nice Indian restaurant

Indian,"Kailash Parbat, Singapore",Nice Chat... Good Bhatura,1,50,5-Jan-12,"The chat quality is very good. Should try the Chat Palette !! I like the way they serve the Pani Poori, however the filling is mostly potatoes. They have a variety of Bhatura - avoid Cheese one. Rest are okay, if you don't mind the oily ones. They also have some Rajdhani lotus stem based ones. I liked them. Good spread and worth the price.Better eat in house and not try to pack their breads to eat at home / beach."

More atmosphere and busier at night, whereas Tekku Centre, in Little India and Amoy St Hawkers both were better at lunchtime. Had delicious chilli crab from store 42(?). Tucked in corner. Store beside, 43 Indian Kitchen served us best Indian we had in Singapore. Chicken tikka and fish kebab roll was the perfect lunch choice.Clean and spacious and only two stops on MRT from our hotel."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must do in Singapore,1,40,15-Oct-18,Always on my list to visit when in Singapore the chilli crab is amazing. Walk around and check all the stores and compare prices and service.

With 80 plus vendors, there is something for everyone. The place is spotless, with cleaners continuously cicling the venue. I have read that people say it is expensive. This is untrue for what you get. First class meals in a relaxed environment. Very suitable for kids as well.Joe. Melbourne."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Just gets better each time,1,50,30-Aug-18,"Been here many a time over the years, used to be very popular with local families, food was served on banana leaves and apart from chopsticks, the utensil of choice was your hands.Roll on 20 years, the hawker stands are all on the outside of the open air area, pick a stand/food style you like and enjoy, some places give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready.We arrived as a party of 7, all wanting different food, this place is ideal, just getting a table is the hardest part. My favourite stand is no 31, try the stingray, absolutely fantastic, with seafood fried rice and morning glory veg dripping with garlic. Indonesian, Thai, local Singapore and Indian as well as traditional and specialised Chinese is all available.Prices are getting higher, but as usual we over ordered, about $25 Singapore dollars for a fabulous meal"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night eats - the best!,1,50,28-Aug-18,"There are not many outdoor hawker centres in Singapore now - this might be the last one. Great atmosphere, lots of yummy food and so very fun. It can get pricey so it's not a ""cheap eat"" anymore, but so worthwhile. It's featured in ""CRAZY RICH ASIANS""... added bonus! So cool to promote the hawkers. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great choice of food,1,40,19-Aug-18,Visited at about 8.00 on a Friday night and really struggled to get a table. You can obviously eat from any of the stalls but the tandoori on the outside was great for authentic Indian food.

Always great. My daughter’s favourite Indian food in Singapore and high on my list as well.If you go to Newton, watch out for ordering from the seafood restaurants that charge by the 100 grams.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Sinful Dinner,1,40,17-May-18,"These days in Singapore, we do not have much Hawker centre like this.

In Singapore? Go. I have been for 40 years. And so do many locals. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food was great!,1,50,30-Apr-18,"I can honestly not say anything about the prices and or whether or not you're being ripped off as a tourist, as we went with a local who ordered (and paid :-)) for us - but the food was very yumm! We had a variety of local dishes, among them carrot cake, oyster omelette and fried yellow noodles. All of it was very good. All in all, we found this place a lot less touristx than the Telok Ayer Food Centre for example."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hands down my most favourite hawker in Singapore!,1,50,13-Apr-18,"Luckily my friend lives a 5 minute walk from here, so I was able to visit MANY times on my most recent trip to Singapore. There’s is not one particular stall I can recommend... just try as many as you possibly can! I used to obsess over the sambal stingray, the chilli crab (a fraction of the price you will pay at Boat Quay, and wayyyyyy tastier!) the grilled prawns, cockles, cereal prawn... amazing!!! But now I’ve gone a bit veggie/veganish, I’m now obsessed with all the amazing veggie dishes! Baby Kai lan, Sambal kangkong - the spicy green stringy one (you’ll know when you see it) veggie fried rice and noodles. Veggie Thai food, tom yum, salad, to name a couple. Roti prata and dal or veggie curries. Fresh coconut water. Omg the list just goes on!!! If you are in singapore VISIT VISIT VISIT!!! I didn’t see the lady with the beehive hair this time, but for the seafood eaters, look out for her, they do the BEST sambal stingray :) "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Nice food centre,1,40,12-Mar-18,"Newton was easy to get to from the train and well laid out. We went for lunch on Monday so quiet a few were closed but had some great Chinese bbq, Satays and Indian food good value and quality. Would be better when more stalls are open so worth the trip would be good at night "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Black pepper crab,1,40,8-Feb-18,"I've been to this place many times. I think tourist have to choose the good seller than the bad one in here. I always come to the lady that have shop in the middle of the hawker at the right end (forgot the hawker number). Her menu for the crab has a price also for small, medium or large so it's a fixed price. She always give me a small price for a medium crab. I paid S$ 42 for a medium black pepper crab which is quite good. The taste is delicious as well."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","What an amazing, exciting experience",1,50,19-Jan-18,"Friends from Singapore took us here for dinner one evening, WOW are we glad they did.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food,1,40,12-Jan-18,"We where there with 5 people enjoying food from different stalls. It's a Asian style environment but still focused on foreign tourist.
The food was super"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Halal seafood available,1,40,31-Dec-17,Thumbs up!! Prices are very reasonable. Be prepared to share tables since always crowded. One downside is when having to sit in between very loud boisterous dinner groups.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good value for a family,1,40,31-Dec-17,"This Centre is a few minutes walk from the Newton MRT station. We found the food fresh, tasty and very good value. We explained that our Coeliac son had to have gluten free food and the lady sourced dishes from a few stalls for him. Cheapest meal we had in Singapore!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing food,1,50,27-Dec-17,Dropped in for dinner the other night. Fantastic selection of food to suit most tastes. Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. Soft shell crab was great. Selection of Indian curries was awesome. Dumplings were delicious. Prices were reasonable for both food a drinks. Can be a little overwhelming on arrival as stall holders bid for your business. Recommend a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Street food,1,50,25-Dec-17,"If you want real food, authenticity and local produce without the frills then this is the place. We loved it, went everyday once we discovered it. Please note, it’s cheap and is not at all flash so if you like silver service, this is NOT for you. The food however is fresh and delicious. $10 will get you just about anything and a large beer will set you back $5. Refreshingly affordable and authentic."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great night out with the family,1,40,22-Dec-17,"Took the family (some hadn't been here before) for dinner with a difference. The food was as good as it has been in the past, fast service, great selection at very reasonable prices.Not quite as charming as it was years ago but all very neat, tidy and clean.The grand-children enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food. I enjoyed the food and the cold beers!As in the past this will always be a place I visit when in Singapore!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fried oyster omelette,1,40,17-Dec-17,Nice food. Too less variety. Most of the are selling the same food. Fried oyster omelette and Satay from stall 73 and stall 76 meat try.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food exhibition ,1,40,15-Dec-17,Newtons hawker center hasn't changed much in the past 20years.. the food quality is very good and there are plenty of options to choose from.. since most of the seating is outdoor / it can be inconvenient when it rains.. will be back some day..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety ,1,40,5-Dec-17,"As this is a hawker center, we ordered different kinds of food to try and share amongst ourselves.We had satay, grilled chicken wings, fishball noodles and reddish cake. The food was delicious and nice to be shared. We washed down our food with Tiger beer, which made our experience very enjoyable.Do sit in the open air section in the middle, as it gets quite stuffy under the shelter."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hectic and delicious!,1,40,2-Dec-17,"This was my second visit, we visited a few years before and I was not ready for all the sprooking which at first put me off. Visiting again and being prepared for all the sprooking this time I enjoyed the experience a lot more. The place is very busy due to popularity, a lot of locals eat here too, not just tourists. There is so much to choose from and the food is absolutely delicious. Have to have some satay and watermelon juice!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Represents S’pore food, culture at great price",1,50,9-Nov-17,"If you are a tourist, expatriate working here or a Sporean, Newton HC is the place to visit for a great night with friends. It had its ugly past from a few black sheeps touting food in the competitive environment but what Spore food you need to try out is here. Not the top in each category, but the variety is good enough. Bad food will self eliminate the stalls anyway... my personal preference- braised duck meat, oyster omelette, rojak, satay, fish ball soup, and of course of the bbq stingrays, crayfish etc. No specifix stalls for mention. Beside Newton MRT station"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Perfect Singapore chilli crab,1,50,6-Nov-17,"Alliance seafood’s Singapore chilli crab is mentioned in the Singapore Michelin guide and as expected it’s faultless. The Sri Lankan crabs are fresh, juicy and tender and the sweet and tangy sauce has the right level of heat. The fried mantou (buns) are the best to soak it up with. They go that little bit extra and provide plastic gloves and napkins. Look for stand 27. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always a good meal,1,40,31-Oct-17,"Newton can be over hypped but there is good food to be found. I am a local and I would eat there.. So enjoy the satay, popiah, malay rice esp the corner stall, thai all good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The best,1,50,30-Oct-17,"Having been warned by a friendly taxi driver to agree prices before we placed the order, we braved a visit here. The result was one of the best meals - Chilli Crab of course. We were lucky to pick The Ocean BBQ ( stall 16) run by a gentleman by the name of Dino Marn. And so glad we did. All up including the taxi it cost us $100 for 2 including drinks. Well worth it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore Chilli Crab,1,40,14-Oct-17,"Newton Hawker Centre was recommended and the Singapore Chilli Crab as the dish you should try. Well the place has a lot of budget meals and eateries, but the hawkers do not relent, you want to look at a menu and prices and they want to sit you down and shove a meal in front of you. Found a place for chilli Crab, most places charge $5 per 100gram of crab weight. Advice is to see Crab and get an estimate of weight and cost before you order, we did about face and paid the price. The meal was very good, did not have to wait long. After our meal we got our bill and to our surprise it was not what we expected. the Crab was nowhere near half a kilo let alone we paid for over a kilo. There is a large selection of meals and they start around $4, select a couple of dishes and you have a good meal. A wide variety Indian, Malay, chinese and Singaporean. Alcohol is also available."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best hawker center,1,50,12-Oct-17,This is the best hawker center on singapore. On advice i went to two other hawker centers and was sadly disappointed. Newton is definitely has the best to offer. Its very clean and has excellent stalls to choose from. Number 31 heng heng bbq has excellent food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great variety, something for all tastes.",1,40,29-Sep-17,"We had one of the best lobster meals ever!!! Black pepper lobster, you get to choose the lobster and pay by the 100g. Excellent food.
There is dozens of food shops with dining tables outside under the fans. So much to choose from."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the BEST places for amazing food in Singapore,1,50,20-Sep-17,"Newton Hawker Centre is a buzzing place with incredible food and a fantastic vibe. We tried so many food options and everything was amazing.....not to mention very affordable in what is an expensive city with cheap food and really good drinks options and prices (hello, $39 for a bucket of 6 coronas). Highly recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but bad ambience,1,40,11-Sep-17,"Went recently, food was great. Ordered the standard sugar cane juice, sting ray, satay and rojak. All are a must try. Food are reasonably priced.Ambience however was not my favourite. Hot and stuffy, filled with smoke and grease. Some touting, but they leave you to be if you are not interested. Must go if you stay at Sheraton hotel as it is walking distance."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food reasonably priced,1,40,5-Sep-17,"We have eaten here quite a lot. First time we have eaten the Chili Crab, my wife says its great, my satay sticks were a bit fatty but not bad."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Local Sout East Asia street food , all the flavour risk free",1,50,24-Aug-17,"I have been visiting Newton Circuss Hawker center since 30 years ago. Convenient - MRT (Metro) station across the street. A short walk (10 mins) form bussy commercial district of Orchard Road.Dozens of food kiosks and stalls with tasty and delicious local meals prepared on the spot. fast food, NO JUNK food.It can be crowdy... anytime. specially at conventional dinner times. Id that is the case... just be patient and be fast to grab a table. or just look around to make your mind on wtah to eat.. and take out or eat on the go.It is open air.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Inconsistent ,1,40,22-Aug-17,"The place is always busy, but well organise as its got nice ambiance, clean, safe, friendly mamas & uncles offering you some different cuisine, though a bit pricey, but the price pays all those above.

Just that this time we were a bit disappointed as we ordered few different dish, most of the dish arrived quickly, but the main dish for our children came way too late while the first dish all were almost finish for us adult ... We had to get up twice reminding the stall to get food out. We ll go to another stalls next time ..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent value for money,1,40,20-Aug-17,"When it was too late to go anywhere for dinner, the concierge at our hotel suggested that we go to Newton Hawker Centre for a bite. The place was super crowded even after 11 pm, and everybody there seemed to be enjoying a hearty, and by the looks of it, exotic, meal. We stuck to our favorites, kungpao chicken and fried rice, with pork dumplings on the side. It was quite a satisfying meal, and didn't cost too much too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Worth visiting,1,40,10-Aug-17,This is a popular Hawker center both among locals and visitors. There are dozens of food stalls selling all kinds of things. Seafood is very popular here. I tried the singapore chilli jumbo crab and Bun and it was fantastic. However the price is not transparent in the sense that the stalls don't show you the weight of the fish or prawn they cook. But worth visiting of course.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Integrity at Alliance Seafood at Newton Hawker Ctr,1,40,6-Aug-17,"Ordered a stingray about 4 weeks ago at this store. Turned out to be tough and dry. Upon telling the store the inedible dish, the store assistant offered me a different dish free of charge. However at that time I had ordered a similar dish from an adjacent store so I declined. To my pleasant surprise, Alliance promptly refunded the dish in FULL. As a local Singapore which had eaten at numerous hawker centers, I had never experienced a full refund, bar none, no matter how bad the food was. Well done Alliance! Am coming back to try your other dishes as I know I will be eating in peace!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and good local food ,1,50,4-Aug-17,My favorite food in Newton food center is BBQ stingray. Portion is pretty big and very cheap! Highly recommend chili crab as well(we chose #27 stand) if you don't wanna spend over S$100 in Jumbo. We had a small size of fried rice and chili crab and it was S$40 nett. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun,1,40,28-Jul-17,Love this hawker centre!! I live near Orchard road and it's the closest. Good food and beer! Prices are very reasonable!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Packed ,1,40,21-Jul-17,"It's definitely a place for food, a lot of repetition food stall, so just follow your guts and choose one stall. Foods are amazing, price slightly above average and is always packed with people. But don't miss it out. Go and sqeat yourself then order something cold to chill down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good cheap tucker!,1,40,21-Jul-17,"Arrived just after 6pm. While the whole place was very busy, we found a table ok. The lady with the shop nearest the table was over in a flash, with photos on a menu board and asking what we would like. It turned out that she organised drinks (from another nearby vendor) and our two meals, which happened to be from a third vendor. Excellent service and very cheap. So good for local street food that we went back a second night and wull most likely go back again before we leave."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place to eat to experience the Culture,1,40,20-Jul-17,"This is the place to go for a group where you can all choose your individual favourites. There are many many small outlets all servicing different cuisines, from Indian, to Indonesian, to Chinese and many more. It is cheap and very good fun. You can choose what you want and then all sit together at the outside tables in the middle and mix and match!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,1,40,20-Jul-17,"Overwhelming choices of food :-). I am sure each stall has nice food.Especially good was the satay with the peanut sauce. We got them from a stall on the very first row. Open atmosphere, good for evening but might be too hot for a sunny day. Only limited covered places available when raining!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Mud Crab,1,50,17-Jul-17,"What a hilarious experience! I had been told I had to have Chilli Mud Crab whilst in Singapore and one of the Taxi drivers I had (taxis are great and cheap) suggested that this was the place to go. I walked from Pan Pacific Orchard on a pleasant evening and duly ordered. So much food and so much mess eating it but it was delicious. Stall holders took great delight in telling to ""not be neat and use your hands"" and provided me with many additional napkins to help with the clean-up. there were dozens of stall selling an wide variety of food from the very cheap chicken rice through to the mud crabs which was a once in a visit experience. Definitely worth going to. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Dinner,1,50,12-Jul-17,"Too many choice, for stringray grill the best is stall no 61.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hot food cold beer,1,40,25-Jun-17,"Always a great place to visit with friends for tasty food accompanied by jugs of ice cold tiger beer. Cheap, cheerful and tasty .. recommend giving it a go..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at amazing price,1,50,17-Jun-17,"I genuinely think Newton Hawker Center is better than Lau pa Sat. Environment is better and the sellers aren't as pushy as the ones in Lau pa Sat! And it closes at 2am on weekends I believe! If you are going on Friday evening then consider go a bit early like 6-7ish so you can grab seats for you and friends or family, before eveyone else starts to show up. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummmm,1,50,12-Jun-17,Such an enjoyable dining experience in Singapore. Something different than the overpriced and boring food found in the shopping areas.I've heard that tourists get a different price to locals. But the price is so good that it didn't worry us.And they have beer towers!! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton food center,1,50,12-Jun-17,"I was brought here by a family member when i visited Singapore back in April. By the time i visited this one, we already ate at a few other food centers. I think after Lau Pa Sat this was my favorite of them. I let the host order most of the food so im not exactly sure where the food we had ordered came from but it was all so good. We came for dinner and the place was quite crowded but we were able to get a table under the overhang. We were looking for a table out in the open but they were all taken already. Noteable foods we had here, roast duck, char kway kway, baby gai lan, oyster omelette. I enjoyed everything here and thinking about the food is making my mouth water."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Want a taste of Singapore?,1,40,11-Jun-17,"This famous food centre has been around for many years but it is still able to retain its popularity with locals and tourists. There is a good variety of food , most of which are typically Singapore. Local food like satay, oyster omelet , several kinds of noodles ( wanton/roast pork, fishball, minced pork etc), seafood (famous chilli crab, stingray etc) was of a high standard . For thirst-quenching drinks the variety was also good , such as fresh sugar cane juice, fruit juices , local Tiger beer etc. The centre is easily accessible by public transport and is on the Newton MRT stop . The place consists of a covered part next to the stalls and a big middle uncovered part. If it rains , this can be a problem . All in all a very good place to savour the culinary delights of street ( and other ) foods of Singapore. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always great satay,1,40,8-Jun-17,"The satay has always been good at Newton over the many years I have been visiting Singapore. It's the reason I visit Newton. It's still as good as always, and we also really enjoyed the fried rice. Great atmosphere and plenty of choice - a must when visiting Singapore. I've only taken off one point because it's not that cheap anymore and the touting can be a bit annoying, although that has improved greatly over the years."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for drinks and supper,1,50,6-Jun-17,"Stall 29 offered nice cold drinks and super chilled beers. Linda never fails to make you feel welcomed and homely. Great fresh seafood offered at other stalls, when the time of your visit is right."

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",What Do You Want Top Eat?,1,50,28-May-17,"Wow. You can find anything you want to eat at the Newton Hawker Centre which is also a favorite with the locals for authentic local food. There are so many places to choose from and each one specializes in a different type of food.You just sit down anywhere there is room so be aware that you might be sharing your table with someone else but this is a great way to talk with other people. Each table has a number on it' so when you have walked around to see what you want to eat, you place your order and give them your table number and they will bring you your food.I started with some very cold beer because of the heat and then went on to some delicious stay sticks with a very nutty sauce which I loved. I then had fresh prawns with garlic butter and they were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.The Newton Hawker Centre is right beside the Newton MRT station so it very easy to get there and a two minute walk across the walkway to get there from the station.While you are there you can try some Durian fruit; often called the smelliest fruit in the world. It tastes quite nice but you do have to get past the smell.One tip: I found that the undercover area beside the cooking stalls was quite hot even though there are ceiling fans so I shifted to the open area in the middle of the center of the area which was much cooler."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic Hawker centre with so much to choose from.,1,50,24-May-17,You can't come to Singapore without trying the authentic Hawker centre where so many locals eat. The choice of food and freshness is amazing and unbelievably cheap for the amount and quality. Girly recommend this place. Loved it!!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fish Singaporean Style,1,40,24-May-17,"Atmosphere great, buzzing with happy eaters. The food offered is predominately seafood but good and varied. A little pricey."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but not 'hawker prices',1,40,20-May-17,"Given it's located close to the hotel-rich area of Orchard road, the Newton Hawker centre is one of the most famous and well tourist-ed of the hawker centers of Singapore. It is a large open air dining area with basic seats and tables. There are certainly plenty of food options but the prices are significantly higher than what you would expect for a hawker center. Vendors will approach you in an attempt to sell their wares - although unlike other SE asian hawkers, they were honest and open about the product and price. As a rough guide - small chilli crabs are about 35SD, Beers 7SD (for 667ml Tiger), Small squid entrees about 12SD. There is a number of juices and sugar cane options available.Overall this was a good option in terms of food variety, taste and quality but it wasn't cheap for the standard of dining."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The Popular Newton Hawker Centre!,1,50,19-May-17,"This centre serves lots of the Singapore local authentic food and they are not too expensive. Most tables are in the open space and they are always filled with the locals. I went there twice with my family to eat and ordered many dishes to share. Try their satay, fish soup, cockles, gong gong, Singapore laksa and otah! They are also famous for their chillie stingray and ask for the meaty piece so you don't get too many bones! Singapore being such a humid country, I never failed to order my favourite thirst quenching sugar cane juice straight from the presser! Love it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good range of dishes,1,50,17-May-17,"Having driven past this hawker centre literally for decades, I decided to make it my mission to visit. It was quite late in the evening, but the place was still jumping. I decided on noodles and a beer. Both were very pleasant. I will definitely be back to try more of the interesting cuisine on offer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",My favourite hawker centre in Singapore!,1,50,15-May-17,"Whether you want a fresh green coconut, sugar cane drink or some chilli crab this is the place to come!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of hawker food,1,50,29-Apr-17,"Went here based on concierge recommendation. Short taxi from Orchard Road. Amazing selection of hawker street food in a large, clean and vibrant area. The place was packed on a Friday night and we waited a while for a seat. You order and give them your table number and they bring the dishes to you. Hd amazing satays from RB Express Satay (not cheap though at 70 cents SGD per satay); great prawn dumplings; beer; oyster omelette etc. Delicious! We went by taxi and left by Uber - both really easy as they can drive almost to the door. Highly recommended!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Denmark Seafood,1,40,28-Apr-17,"Their Black pepper crab n cereal prawns is wonderfully delicious

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Agree on stall 31 amazing Chilli crab and friendly service,1,50,28-Apr-17,"Chilli crab here was one of my favorite meal in Asia over 10 years , someone else recommended the stall 31 on here and i agree with them , it was great ]
The rest of the market was a great atmosphere too"

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore,1,40,12-Apr-17,"Although designed as a tourist attraction as well as a residential / office worker hawker centre it is certainly worth an evening of any Singapore visitor's itinerary. Yes, it is more expensive than pretty much any other hawker centre in the city, but it is still cheap for what you get: Usually very good, quick food across multiple cuisines: Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Thai, Indian, with lots of fruit and juice (and beer) stalls. It is always lively with a good locals/tourist mix."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A lot of fun!!!,1,40,10-Apr-17,"Great vibe and good food, this is worth the trip even if it was just for the experience. Don't worry about night time travel, it is safe and family friendly. Try everything if you like we had 3 different dishes from 3 different vendors and all were tasty and quickly delivered."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Taste Street Food Here for under SD$10,1,40,5-Apr-17,"This was recommended by our waiter at the cafe in the botanical gardens. It is easy to get to from the MRT line and it has fantastic options for local cuisines. The outlets are graded from A-D for their health code practices. Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on. Cleaners bus these way to be washed and distributed back to the vendors but it is not looked favorably on if you just leave them on the table. Its a good system really.Smoke only in designated smoking sites.Try as much unusual foods as you can or taste your favorites done authentically Singaporean style ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grill Sting Ray,1,40,3-Apr-17,"Fantastic and delicious Grill Sting Ray and Black Pepper Beef.
There are many other seafood.. Also, try to Vegetarian Rojak as it taste quite different from the black sauce."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Kul,1,40,2-Apr-17,"Amazing Chilli Crab ;)
You can enjoy your meals here with many asian food and drinking and many tables inside.
Hawker Center with cars park and near MRT station."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The real deal,1,40,29-Mar-17,"The real deal, as it has been for decades. Close to the city, and Newton MRT. Busy with locals and expats. What impressed me was the freshness and quality of the seafood at a range of outlets -lobster, bugs(sometimes labelled as crayfish, sometimes as lobster-we know them as Balmain Bugs), stingray, tiger prawns. Adam Liaw recommended Stall 27, and the stingray with sambal didn't disappoint. Especially with a cold bottle of Tiger."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Family Dinner,1,40,29-Mar-17,Wow love the different options availabe to you at Newton Circua hawker food center. Anything from Mee Goreng to Chicken Satay to Teh Tarik . Food comes fast and cheap. Would recommend coming just to try all the different dishes.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An experience not to be missed,1,40,23-Mar-17,A wonderful experience with something like 50 or 60 different food outlets to choose from surrounding a central seating area.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food,1,50,19-Mar-17,"Great, clean hawker center that is easily accessible via the MRT. Great food, a little pricier than some other centers. I'd say this one is one more tourists go to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great place to taste local food ,1,50,14-Mar-17,"This is a must-visit hawker center in Singapore. It's relatively cleaner than many other non-air conditioned hawker centers I have visited. To name a few, my favourites are the salad wrap facing carpark, fishballs/fish dumplings from the left (inside) corner stall and satays from Heng ?.There are many stalls selling BBQ seafood too, but be very careful when ordering crab, fish, lobsters and prawns/shrimps because these are usually charged by weight. It's recommended to find out the costs before ordering.By the way, most food here are served in disposable cutlery and utensils."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at cheap prices,1,50,2-Mar-17,Great food at cheap prices. definitely worth the far walk from either MRT Stations (its sort of in between 2 stations)

Prices has gone up but Its still cheap to get good here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good hawker food stalls,1,40,19-Jan-17,"A quality hawker centre with plenty of variety that is close to Orchard Rd. You can get into a queue with the locals or find something yourself. Plenty of seating with fans and stalls with cold drinks and beer. Dishes with duck, chicken rice, Indian, satay's etc available. All priced around $4-5 SGD. Great value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Makan time!!!,1,50,18-Jan-17,"Oh my oh my ! its been almost a decade since I gone to Newton Hawker Center. Now its new , clean and spacious. Prices use to be extremely steep with stalls cheating out prices but not anymore . Price are pretty standard then outside hawker stalls no just expect slightly bit more. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy cheap food!,1,50,17-Jan-17,Best place for a famous hawker market meal in Singapore - its clean and comfortable and the food is of an excellent quality for the standard - you will not be disappointed and will leave full and happy!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing food variety,1,50,16-Jan-17,A short distance walk from our hotel at Grand Hyatt. Wide variety of food to choose for and still very reasonable price with the new government tightening the pricing to attract tourists. I would recommend here if you want to try variety of Singaporean food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Seafood,1,40,13-Jan-17,"Visited for dinner one night after a recommendation from the hotel. Glad we went. There are a lot of vendors to choose from and a good choice of food.It is mainly seafood, but there are noodle dishes and chicken on offer. Have to recommend the grilled prawns, chilli crab, followed by an ice cold tiger.It isn't the cheapest food on offer in Singapore, but some of the freshest."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Easy to reach, good food, a bit pricey",1,40,12-Jan-17,"We always come to newton Circus hawker to find Halal Chilli Crab. The official halal sign appears in the particular sea food stalls. Mostly delicious, You must try Chilli Crab, Grilled Stingray and Fired Mantou"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun place to try local dishes,1,40,2-Jan-17,"Newton Hawker Centre is just a short walk from the Sheraton Towers. Be aware, however, that it will require a small hike up a long flight of stairs to get up to the overpass to cross Bukit Timah Road. The food selection is good and very inexpensive. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit this Hawker Centre as there are many in Singapore, but if in the area, I would definitely recommend it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ask for Alvin at Alliance seafood no 27,1,50,31-Dec-16,"Went with son and our wives. He is a regular and made straight for Alliance Seafood number 27 and Alvin. They are in the Michelin Guide. We shared a variety of platters and I liked them all, but especially the calamari. This is alfresco eating and the centre is full of locals. So it should have been good and certainly was."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great experience.,1,40,28-Dec-16,"We were staying in the centre of Singapore and found it very easy to use the public transport and go further afield. We took the tube to Newton Circus, which was cheap and the trains ran regularly. The actual food market has outside seating for diners and the idea is you choose from the menus of any of the food venues. We got rice from one, drinks from another and the main meal from a third... It's a kind of mix and match and each venue gives you a bill for what you had from their menu. Overall, it was a cheap night out and we enjoyed the food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Hawker Center I've Visited,1,40,10-Dec-16,"Overall, I liked this Hawker Center the best of the 3 that I have visited. it's not the biggest, but it is clean, easy to get to (very close to subway stop), and they have a very good variety of food and drinks. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the other hawker centers selling oyster omelettes...but they had them here...and it was delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best oyster omelette Hup Kee stall 73,1,40,3-Dec-16,"One of the best oyster omelette in Singapore. Still the best to date. We have been eating from this Aunty for more than 10 years. Her oyster omelette is always fried to the right colour, nicely browned, and not too oily. The oysters... Always big and very fresh. A must try when you are at newton hawker. Also generous with her garnishing of coriander and spring onion. A must-eat when there!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",You must visit and have a meal at Newtons,1,50,25-Nov-16,"This the original street food presented in a safe clean environment .

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus is as good as ever ...,1,50,15-Nov-16,"This was my fifth visit to Singapore and I couldn't not go to Newton Circus. I first went there in 1980: it was amazing then and, I was now delighted to see, it still is amazing ...So many stalls are so very good: there are several good satay stalls (actually they're all good!) while the seafood - particularly the tiger prawns - is wonderful. We especially liked the food from Stall 49 (curiously named 'Denmark Seafood') who seemed to have a symbiotic relationship with Stall 48 ('Sim Huat') who kept us plied with those large bottles of Tiger Beer.At the end of that particular evening these good people bade us goodbye - shaking hands with us - with a cheerful ""see you again"". They will: we will be back!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",New experience,1,50,12-Nov-16,When I asked taxi driver to take me to hawker centre he wanted to know if it was the right address ? It a culture shock initially from beautiful restaurants to London wooden tables and benches and not many foreigners there ! You go from stall to stall seeing all this freshly cooked food and deciding what to have .I had chicken satay yo die for special flavoured rice and crab to die for .No wonder this is where the locals eat best meal I have had since arriving in Singapore and such good value for money a definite must when visiting Singapore .
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pretty decent hawker food close to Orchard,1,40,9-Nov-16,"Nice little centre, focused mostly on seafood. Black Pepper crab is delicious. Also have beer towers icy cold."

We had Black Pepper crab with seafood Fried Rice and we loved every bit of it. I tried the sugar cane juice and ended up having 2 glasses. The place was crowded but the service was prompt & very courteous
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tasty food, reasonable price",1,40,27-Oct-16,"A big improvement on the old hawker centre I remember from years ago. All paved, clean, wash basins provided, and the food was good. Not cheap by street food standards but reasonably priced and a ""small"" serve was still plenty for one or as part of a number of share plates for two. Not overly hassled by vendors to take their menus. Selected from a variety of stalls. Service was quick. All the food was tasty. Mainly seafood but other meat choices available. Went on a friday night and no problems to get a table before 7pm but then was very busy after that. Better signage once you come out of the exit at Newton MRT would be useful (follow the path sharp left out of station exit)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",old favourite freshened up but didn't dissapoint,1,50,23-Oct-16,"still stunning array of delicacies to sample and get a good cross section of the best cuisine in the country. well priced, handy vendors who find a seat and a cold beer for you...love the whole thing. satays and chilli crab the best pics."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good and plenty of food choices, nowadays also easier to get a table",1,40,23-Oct-16,"Newton Hawker Centre is/was always popular with foreigners ,tourist and expat alike, which live nearby or in CBD area. This explains also why its more expansive compare to other Hawker centres. Food quality and choice is good and tasty and nowadays you get a table faster then before."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good old Newton Hawker Centre ,1,40,19-Oct-16,"I grew up with Newton. This was our fave food place after a night out in town during the 1990s. The current revamped hawker street food is more organized and cleanliness has improved tremendously. Some all time fave food would include prawn noodle soup, oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, BBQ stingray in sambal chilli sauce and hokkien fried prawn noodles. There is a Chinese dessert stall in the left hand row as you enter via the car park. They have one of the best Chinese dessert selection at good value prices. Dining here this evening certainly brought back many memories"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place!!,1,50,18-Oct-16,"The food is amazing. Lots of fun and the food is great. Lots of stalls. Try lots of things. The stingray is good, but be sure to scrape it sideways instead of trying to cut into it to avoid the bones. Great food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and yummy,1,50,17-Oct-16,"I've searched this hawker food here in TripAdvisor and satisfied with the reviews so I decided to have a visit. The place was so clean and they offer lots of food variety, name it and I'm sure they have it here. From noodles to rice chicken and duck. I'm telling you this is a must try if you are visiting Singapore try hawker food it's cheap like 5 to 10 SGD only for a complete heavy set of meal with a nice shakes! You're missing something in Singapore if you don't try this one "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy hawker food,1,50,13-Oct-16,"Not too far from Orchard rd, 5 minutes by taxi or 20 minute walk from Far east plaza. to a yummy outdoor food court. Great service as you grab a table which is numbered, order your food and drink and they bring to your table freshly cooked. Satays, calamari and chicken wings were yummy. The satays so delicious that we ordered another batch of 50 amongst a family of 5. Relaxing outdoor setting on a balmy night eating Satays and drinking ling neck Tiger beers and the kids drinking freshly squeezed juices was sensational and very reasonably priced."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another great Hawkers food market in Singapore. ,1,50,9-Oct-16,"This hawkers market has recently been given a make over. Lovely clean tables and seats with plent of room for all. So many choices that it gets hard to decide what and where to eat. The food is fresh, flavorful and cheap. Order you meals from the hawkers and they deliver your selections to your table and then you pay them. Cash only trade here. Watch out for the man selling tissues, as the hawkers don't have napkins. A must to visit in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit!,1,40,8-Oct-16,I love the diverse food you can get here! The stall holders are all very knowledgable and are very accommodating. You must give this a go when you are in Singapore.

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still th same after al these years,1,40,4-Oct-16,This has got to be one of the best places to visit to experience the broad range of foods groups and styles typical to Singapore and the Asian region. Open all night it is also a great place for supper after a few drinks with friends. They used to have the biggest chicken wings I had ever seen but not anymoreThis time it was oyster omelet and mutton soup on the way home. So much choice there is something for everybody
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lively and good food,1,40,23-Sep-16,"If you like your food al fresco with about a thousand others, both locals and tourists, this is your go to place. Newton has become our first checkpoint whenever we travel to Singapore.Endorsed by the Singaporean Tourism promotion board you get a first profile of local cuisine at 83 food stalls. Not all of them are different though. Among locals Newton has gained notoriety as some stalls were overcharging for their seafood. So better check prices and make sure you don't receive something you did not order. We however did not encounter any problems. Stall owners were friendly, food arrived fast and we got what we ordered. We enjoyed yummy fish ball kway tiao, excellent chicken wings and tasty kalian. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood nice,1,50,20-Sep-16,"Food nice and good price newton in the best place to eat and hangout .

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,1,40,12-Sep-16,"A place which you can try most of the local food in one place.We usually visit this place once a month. And the usual stalls that we will visit is 'Hai Yan Seafood' and the fried oyster egg stall which the auntie has a bit of attitude problem. :p But the fried oyster egg is really yummy.The staff at 'Hai Yan' is super friendly. The stall is facing the main car park of Newton Circus. The service is good, price is reasonable and the food is yummy. We always order the sambai stingray and clams. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great introduction - tourist-friendly enough but also authentic - a good mix,1,50,2-Sep-16,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. A great mix of options and a good intro to Hawker Centres. It's clean enough without being too sanitised - bustling and (important bit) the food options are good. Also, drinks are a lot cheaper than in hotels so have a few beers while you're there. Note: Hawker Centres are not great for vegetarians at all - very few dishes that are all vegetable even, and I suspect even those ones may be cooked using some seafood-based sauces and / or in pans that are also used for meat/poultry/seafood."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good to visit food center,1,40,24-Aug-16,"Crowded mostly by locals, not centrally located but worth a visit.
Big variety of local food, other asian countries cuisines also available.
Satay, chicken rice, carrot cake and all traditional singapore dishes are available here.
Good prices and nice place."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit,1,40,30-Jul-16,"Many, many years ago, the hawker centre was at the Orchard Road in front of Cold Storage supermarkets. It still has a similar vibe. Chinese, Malay, seafood.... Clean and true food. A definite must visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow what a winner,1,40,26-Jul-16,This was not the cheapest hawker centre we encountered but it was a winner. All the dishes we tried were great. We will be back!

Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience,1,50,11-Jul-16,What a selection - food in Singapore is very safe to eat as very strict guidelines apply. Great selection of food in Hawkers markets. Find a table and note the number on table. Order and pay for food from the many different little food stalls providing table number - When food or drinks are ready stall worker brings to table.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quintessential Singapore Chilli Crab at 31 Heng Heng BBQ,1,50,7-Jul-16,"Took the train to Newton station to have chilli crab on our last day, had to be done. Getting of the train you come out by a roundabout in a nothing looking part of town. Thanks to Google maps for showing the way as it looked like there was nothing there. After locating the area, a triangle of seating and small cooking shacks we went around to view the variety on display. We decided on 31 Heng Heng BBQ. The place was spotlessly clean and the crabs were top quality, heavy and fresh. We ordered a $38 crab and some fried rice. What can I say but it was the best crab I have had, so much meat it easily fed two of us. The sauce was medium hot but you could go either way by request. Highly Recommended."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique hawker center,1,50,1-Jul-16,"OK, it is influenced by tourist, but still authentic enough to be recommended especially noting the location. It is a 15 Minute walk from Orchard corner Scotts. Too bad that no authentic Laksa place remained after the recent Renovation. Washrooms much better now."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","No longer cheap, but better than ever.",1,40,28-Jun-16,"The Newton Circus of old, and what exists now. are world's apart. The food hasn't changed much (it was always worth having), but the physical setting has, and it is much for the better. It is brighter, cleaner, and amazingly efficient. But beware, the seafood dishes can be very expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great chilli crab at newton,1,40,27-Jun-16,"I was recommended this venue by a friend who lived here for 10 years, as an alternative to the east coast seafood market, as it was raining when I visited. This indeed is a really cool place for chilli or pepper crab, and an array of other Asian foods.A big tip to remember here is to ask the stall seller to weigh your food first before ordering, as prices vary greatly.Worth a visit, and easy access by taxi and MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and good place for food!,1,40,23-Jun-16,"I was looking to try some local delicacies when my hotel concierge advised to visit Newton Hawker street. For my 6 day Singapore visit, I visited this place twice for dinner. The only catch is to wear loose and light clothes as this place is open and was pretty humid outside. Overall must visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good atmosphere,1,40,2-Jun-16,"We went one evening just for a drink as we could walk from our hotel , it was late on a Saturday night and still very busy . It looked very clean and lots of wash basins around the edge to be able to wash your hands after messy food like chilli crab . We went back on Monday and it was still surprisingly busy . It was good food but not much for a vegetarian . It is priced reasonably and a family of three sat at our table as it is free seating and chatted to us . It is well worth a visit ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food !!!,1,50,28-May-16,"On the way to the center of the city, Newton Hawker Centre has a variety of options. I heard about it many times. However after living in Singapore for almost 4 years, we accidentally landed there. It has been an awesome experience of seafood - pepper crab, cereal prawn, kai lang in oyster sauce, chicken fried rice - all MUST try @Heng Heng BBQ-(31) - thanks for making our first trip a memorable one - we will definitely be back soon Kishaloya - Singapore, May 2016 "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Yummy, cheap and fun",1,40,26-May-16,"Great hawker market for a cheap meal in Singapore. Lots of stalls around the edges with tables in the middle the only problem is deciding what to try! We had a delicious satay and fried carrot cake with two very cold large beers. Top food, great experience wish I could have dinner here every night!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food and great prices,1,40,9-May-16,"Don't come here just for the seafood. Eat what the locals eat! You can barely see locals ordering seafood here, so look around the tables to get an idea of what to eat.Some recommendations that won't break the bank will be oyster omelette, prawn noodles with soup, fish soup noodles, fried prawn noodles, fried noodles (char kway teow) and shaved ice to top it off!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tiger Prawns & Stingray,1,50,5-May-16,We have just spent three days in Singapore and had lunch at the Newton Hawker Centre twice. The tiger prawns cooked with lots of garlic and the stingray with a hot sauce were fantastic. Had them both days. Beer was also pretty cheap with a big bottle of Tiger only $7.50 (compared to what you would pay in a bar or hotel for a small bottle). Definitely recommend.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Some good things to try (other than the seafood),1,40,5-May-16,"Long before Newton Hawker Center came to be associated with expensive grilled seafood for tourists, locals used to come here for :1. Tanglin Hokkien noodles and oyster omelette 2. Bee Heng popiah and satay3. Heng fied carrot cake (this is actually mashed turnip/radish fried with egg, garlic and spring onions and, as an option - a sweet black sauce).We visited this evening for takeout of the Hokkein noodles, chicken satay and popiah. The Hokkein noodles fried fresh prawns and squid and a tasty prawn stock and, served with delicious sambal chilli and freshly squeezed lime juice was as good as it ever was (in high priced Singapore portions have shrunk though).The satay (boneless chicken skewered on wooden sticks and grilled) was fragrant and tender as was the roasted peanut gravy it was served with.The popiah didn't live up to expectations though - this is similar in concept to the Vietnamese rice paper rolls. The SE Asian version has stewed turnip, crunchy peanuts, chopped boiled egg and lettuce wrapped in thin popiah skin made from rice flour. The popiah skin does not have the translucent sticky texture of the Vietnamese version - it has a drier more grainy texture. What we got at Newton though was a little too dried out and the stewed turnip didn't have the depth of flavour we remembered. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Cuisine.,1,40,4-May-16,"Day 1 of our brief trip to Singapore concluded with dinner at this well known Hawker Centre in Newton Circus. A short taxi ride away from our Hotel.One is spoilt for choice at this venue with several hawkers all offering the same menu - be it seafood, or Malay Muslim cuisine, etc. Other hawkers only deal in fruit juices, soft drinks and beers.After a brief wander, we decided on Takara Grilled Seafood (Shop No. 74) run by Winnie.My wife and I shared the Black Pepper Singapore Crab, a baby Stingray and a portion of Seafood Noodles - ample quantities and really delicious. We had asked Winnie to hold the spice which was done.....The Hawker Centre was bustling and appears very popular with both residents and tourists. We returned to our hotel by Metro as Newton Station is a short walk away from the Hawker Centre."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic and delicious seafood,1,50,28-Apr-16,Very good variety of local cuisine and also alot of fresh seafood dishes to choose from. Would recommend this place to many tourists as the place accomodates to many people and has quite a huge varety of local dishes. One may also compare this to the famous Lau Pa Sat which is another food place enjoyed by both locals and tourists. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing Seafood!,1,50,24-Apr-16,"Fresh cheap and you cannot go wrong here!
Personal favourite spot!
The 'Chilli Crab' is amazing too! Everthing thing else really is actually!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Closed for renovation & off the topic,1,40,26-Mar-16,"Wanted to visit Newton Circus last night, but the taxi driver convinced us that the place has been closed. So decided to visit Lau Pa Sat instead after 20 years. No reason to go back there again. Food was below par, the whole place was somehow very messy. Very crowded though, so not everyone may share our feeling.Just checked, according to the National Environment Agency homepage Newton Circus is closed on 1 February - 24 April 2016. Suprised to see some reviews from February visits.Anyway, waiting for the next visit to Newton. Maybe not the most original of hawker centers, but we've always been happy with the food and service in general."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and cheerful.,1,50,25-Mar-16,Experience good food and mix with the locals. Close to the MRT. Chilli crab is a must. Table service from Aunty was awesome!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and delicious,1,50,16-Mar-16,"This place is a large outdoor foodcourt. Its a hawker centre, opens later in the day. Plenty of tourist and locals eat here. Food is pretty cheap here. I spent $5 in total for a decent meal with a drink here. The skewers are the best, costing me only 60c per stick. No table service, and no air-conditioning, its outdoor. So its a bit hot and humid, but thats normal singapore weather. Overall, an enjoyable experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singaporean Cuisine,1,40,18-Feb-16,"Having read about hawker centres we wanted to experience one and this was the closest to our hotel (walking distance) I read that all Singapore eateries are hygiene rated and whilst a hawker stall rarely if ever achieves A status there are plenty of B status to choose from. The food we chose was very very tasty and very very cheap, the most expensive thing was beer. Well worth a visit if you want to experience the real food of Singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy,1,40,17-Feb-16,Make sure you try the chilli crab and chilly stingray we sometimes make a special effort when in Asia to visit Singapore just to eat at this hawker centre
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Night for Big Groups,1,40,9-Feb-16,"Superb evening that lasted well towards midnight, must be the cheapest way to have ice-cold beers with friends in Singapore. The outdoor style is lovely but it gets very hot! Love the carrot cake place and the pirate seafood stall! Delicious! Clean toilets and great choice of local delights! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Essential For Experiencing Singapore,1,50,2-Feb-16,"I consider this Hawker Food Centre a ''Must'' to visit every time I'm in Singapore . The choice of regional dishes is very large indeed , and I'm never disappointed , regardless of what I elect to eat any particular evening ... be it Thai , or Indian or the standard Singaporian noodle dishes in any of their many varieties . Fish , meat , fowl , or vegetarian , it all seems good to me ! Price per basic dish is almost invariably under $10 , and satay costs 70cents a stick . Plenty of choice of drinks , tho' I invariably go for the freshly opened coconut + a straw while waiting for my order of food to be served .The layout of this Centre has changed very considerably from its previous format . The hawker food stalls are arranged around a central open air eating area ( though there is a fair amount of covered eating available if it rains ) . One would do well to check the weather forecast on the excellent local web site NEA-MISS before going ! I recommend taking a stroll round all the stalls in the outer perimeter to see what takes one's fancy . Do not be pressurised by any vendor into taking a seat alongside his particular stall until you've made up you mind ( or unless you are by yourself ) . Otherwise pick seating for yourselves , preferably in the central open area , before you go and order any dish .... but you MUST remember your table number to place your order ( and exactly where it is , so YOU can find your way back to it again ) Leave one of you at the table to ''reserve'' your seats while the other(s) place orders .I've always found the food quality very good , and frequently excellent , but it's a matter of personal taste , and sometimes of luck . What is encouraging is the number of ''locals'' packing into the place for an evening meal . Extremely easy to get to . Take the MRT to Newton station , and it's a 5 minute walk from there . Savour the food as much as you'll enjoy the buzz of the experience . Enjoy !"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow experience - Hawker centre unlike any,1,50,1-Feb-16,"Visited twice for dinner during my stay in Singapore. Essentially the Hawkers have almost identical food, but what differentiates each of them is the personal touch in the taste based on the hawkers own style conditioned from the individual cultural & regional backgrounds. Must try the Chilli beef and the sting-ray. You can also order beers from and RTD bottles from most of the hawkers and have a drink with your meal. Great place to visit with friends, family or even a lone traveller."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An interesting evening,1,40,29-Jan-16,"I had previous eaten in the Hawker market in both Chinatown and Little India, however this was a difference experience. Being more little stands to chose from. My friends and I several types of food. Chinese, Indian, and Japanese. The atmosphere is really lively and lots of fun. The real plus was lots of tables with umbrellas if the weather gets wet, and a restroom with plenty of area to wash up after the somewhat messy chili crabs."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good social eating,1,50,25-Jan-16,"Dress down, chill out, dining with a beer!! Based around a set courtyard with vendors serving diners in reach of their cabin. This place is 24 hours and is also respected for its cleanliness - Worth the cab ride!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Busy with great variety,1,50,16-Jan-16,"Visited with friends. This food is mildly cheaper than the food courts in the shopping centres but the atmosphere was much better.Look at the vendors shop fronts. If it says ""self service"" it means you have to take your food to the table, if not, they will deliver the food to you (so take note of your table number). We had the Char Siu, steamed veges, butter chicken Paneer, naan & satay. All very nice. Adequate portions."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a trip,1,40,15-Jan-16,Easily found close to the MRT line. Cheap with a wide variety of food.. High turn over with fresh quality food.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good fun!,1,40,13-Jan-16,"We caught a cab here one night particularly for chilli crab. It only cost us about S$18 by cab from the Carlton hotel. We walked around before choosing which hawker we would eat at. The prices all seem much the same. We had 4 huge prawns around 200g ea, we paid $8 per 100g so $16 per prawn. Our crab was a medium size & cost us $40. We bought beers from the stall next door. It was a great fun experience & the food tasted great!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Make sure this is on your list of places to eat whilst in Singapore! ,1,50,10-Jan-16,"We visited 'Newton Circus' 3 times whilst in Singapore and each time was amazing All stores are basically the same type of food/dishes and quality, so doesn't matter what stall you order from, you're guaranteed a tasty, cheap meal! $4 per 100g for crab, (make sure you find out the weight of the crab before purchasing, we got a kg crab which was about $40aud) then choose your flavour, we tried the black pepper crab on our first visit and chilli crab on our 2nd, both were amazingly tasty, sweet juicy crab meat! Very messy, but definitely worth it, don't forget to order a portion of fried buns to mop up all the juices! The prawns are also tasty, but again just make sure you find out how much they weigh before ordering, otherwise you could end up with a massive bill (and a lot of wasted food) we had one prawn each, this prawn was as long and wide as my hand when sliced down the centre! Plump and juicy! One was more than enough, the equivalent of maybe 6 Australian king prawns! We also tried blachan stingray, and oh my god, what a flavour explosion! Another must try when in Singapore! Drinks are also cheap, around $2 for a soft drink and about $7 for a beer/cider. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Singapore! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Cheap food, cheap drinks, great deal",1,50,10-Jan-16,"We knew the food would be good and cheap. The big bonus was cheap beer (compared to every other venue in town). A big bottle of Tiger set me back $9.50 which is considerably better than the $12 to $18 for a small bottle in other city venues. Food preparation was fast and the taste was awesome. Everything was fresh as these vendors go through a lot of product nightly. Go on your own, as a couple, as a family, or as a group of friends on a night out. Make this the starting point for dinner before hitting the town."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic food and great experience,1,50,9-Jan-16,"We went to this hawkers' market and were delighted with the food. We were helped by the man at the A1 food stall who organised for a table in the middle to be cleared for us. He then explained how things work there and ordered drinks for us. We ordered our meal from him and he brought us the most delicious noodles, chilli crab and garlic prawns all for $75 for 2 people. He brought us a large finger bowl as the crab is messy to eat and then when we finished he brought over some wet wipes. There's a great atmosphere there with about 80 stalls to choose from. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker hawkers more hawkers food ,1,50,5-Jan-16,So many selections of local specialities only wish I have more stomach to try them all !! Chilli crab is not to be missed ..can be pricey but still lot cheaper than other places ..make sure to tell the waiter to show you the catch or the weight of the crab before it gets cooked so you have an idea how much the dish will cost 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food ,1,50,23-Dec-15,"Great food and a fantastic way to experience Singapore food hawker culture, can have a number of different dishes and enjoy a great taste variety , my favourites are stingray, Kang Kong with sambal and chilli prawns delicious"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",#Lovethelocalspread,1,50,21-Dec-15,"A must visit- if you love to experiment with local food and wash down with ice cold beer! Open air seating , which is very nice in December. Must try the Singapore Chilli Crabs with the little Buns! Beautiful...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wow- worth the visit,1,50,18-Dec-15,"Must visit if u dig street food. Bestsingapore crabs, butter garlic prawns from MsTau at stall 70 and try the food from also stall 31."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing choice of yummy and cheap food,1,50,16-Dec-15,"I never go to Singapore without going to Newton Hawker Center. If you haven't ever been to a Food/Hawker center in Singapore, Do it!!! It's the cheapest way to eat while in Singapore. I've been to a few hawker centers around Singapore and this one is the biggest and best I've been to. There are tables and chairs set up in the center, they are surrounded by loads of food stalls selling a variety of Malaysian, Indo, Chinese food. Each stall sells something specific, some serve drinks, some don't. Find a table first, place a packet of tissues on the table to 'hold' it (or have someone sit there and mind the table), take note of the table number, then go in search for food of your choice. Some stalls will ask for your table number and bring it over when ready, others may make you wait while they cook it. Must tries are; BBQ stingray, fried squid, satay skewers, Otah and cold bean curd. And of cause a large bottle of Tiger beer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","whenever in Singapore, a visit to the Newton Hawker Center is a must",1,40,9-Dec-15,"The location is excellent, the variety of food superb. No matter what is your taste, Chinese, Fish, Malay, Indian, Thai.......you'll for sure find what you are looking for. A lot of family business guarantee a perfect service."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A variety of choices,1,40,7-Dec-15,"Ideally located opposite Newton MRT, this food centre offers an array of choices - mostly Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Indian & Thai cuisine."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, fun experience",1,40,3-Dec-15,"This was a fun experience. To set the scene, the hawker stalls are basically in a circle, with an open air eating area in the centre. You walk in and start doing a lap to pick out what looks good. If you don't enjoy the hawker experience then avoid this place. There is a good range of food to choose from, including Singapore Chilli Crab. We got our Singapore Chilli Crab from Mrs Tan at stall 66, although I believe she normally works out of stall 72. We got some satay sticks from stall 74, and a cold beer to wash it down. I wouldn't call the food cheap, but it wasn't too expensive either. in fact, all things considered, the beer was relatively the most expensive thing there at $7 SD a glass. The food was quick and tasty. The meal was all the more enjoyable because the stall operator Mrs tan came over to chat with us. Do make sure you have plenty of napkins as the Singapore Crab is messy. Worth the visit for the experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local gem!,1,40,2-Dec-15,"If you want some tasty, local and value for money food and a typical Singaporean experience then head to Newton hawker centre - 2 mins walk from the Newton MRT station.Lots of food stalls selling a variety of food and drinks, great place to take friends as its such a social place. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton circus,1,50,21-Nov-15,"We recently ate dinner at this hawker centre, the food was fantastic. Store 70 had fantastic food, also satay close by had great food also. Reasonable price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Salty egg crab ,1,50,21-Nov-15,I have tried several different chilli crab places and salty crab places - they all taste different. I was told on the first day by the store owners they are all the same taste. I have to recommend stall 19 for their salty egg crab. Mr and toddler loved it. We went back everyday of our stay in Singapore. Price is decent and a variety of dishes chilli or not. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli Crab,1,50,16-Nov-15,We went during the day which we found out is not a popular time but we still had the chilli crab my husband was chasing. Cost was $40 and the taste was top notch! He also had sambal stingray for $12 which he loved aswell. I had pork and noddles which cost me $5 - make the effort.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","More savvy, much better experience.",1,40,10-Nov-15,"The last time I was here, I had an absolute shocker. Armed with some better knowledge, and a little bit of caution, a much improved experience. Do not eat anything that does not have a price. A huge variety of local food, follow the locals and eat where it's busy and you won't go wrong. Use some common sense and you will not be disappointed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satays Galore,1,50,6-Nov-15,"If you are looking for cheap and reasonable eateries, this is it! Good variety of Asian and freshly squeezed juices, beer and what ever drink takes your fancy. You just have to visit just once and make your mind up."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere and serves food until late!,1,40,6-Nov-15,"We were really impressed having visited many hawker centres which closed early however this was open really late!Normal priced hawker food, various standard types - Indian, Malay, chicken rice (!). Normal priced beer for a hawker centre, around $6.Only thing that means it isn't a 5* rating is the people in the middle of the hawker centre who hawk and try to get you to buy food from certain stalls and pressure you into buying beer from them. Annoying and off putting.Aside from that, was great!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Full of festivity at night ,1,50,2-Nov-15,"So this is suppose to be a tourist trap but it's still so fun. Come at night for dinner or supper simply because there is so many people around. A lot of the stalls seem to sell the same thing which is seafood of various sorts which if fun once in a while. if you are want the more simple stuff like various noodles, po piah or oyster omelette. The thing is there is plenty of choice and there are so many stalls to choose from. It's open air so it can be hot. During the day, it's just not as much fun so it's really a place to come to at night. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Choose what locals eat,1,40,30-Oct-15,"Take time to observe before you choose which stall you'll buy your food. If it's frequented by locals, chances are...the food is good. I ordered duck from this outer stall facing the parking lot. Quite unimpressive and only a few duck meat (contrary to what their pictures showed). "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Spoilt for choice,1,40,30-Oct-15,"We came here on the recommendation of a colleague from Singapore. Having stayed at a hotel for a three day work do and not seen much else than the hotel we were keen to use the last remaining hours before our flight back to the UK seeing and tasting the real Singapore. The main problem we were faced with on arrival was the vast choice! Hunger built as we browsed the stalls and took in the sights and smells of pad thai, laksa, curries, crispy duck, satay and lots and lots of other local delicacies. We settled on some thai food that looked super-fresh, pad thai easily the best I've ever had and a green papaya salad not far behind. It's all very basic with paper plates and plastic cutlery, you drink your coke straight from the can, but the food is the main attraction and well worth the $15 cab fare. After a big gala dinner the night before we were also relieved to find it was the best hangover cure ever!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",don't change what is not broken ,1,40,24-Oct-15,"Newton was my preference to go to after flying in to Singapore on a Friday evening. As a child my parents would use to bring us to visit . Not much has changed ., there are plentiful of choice, Chinese food. Indian , Malay and old favorites plus seafood n great dessert stalls As usual the eye was bigger than the stomach ! We have grilled sting ray with chili sambal - the best ! $12 The satays 80 cents each with min order of 10 sticks were good ! Fried egg oysters, Chinese style fried carrot cake n Indian mamak style fried instant noodle was on order tonightPlus durian ice kachang ! N freshly squeezed sugar cane juice , Great n tasty on a warm eveningLove the fact that you order what you like, choose the size you want and they bring the food to you . Most of these stalls are long time vendors and will still be here for many years to comeAh Newton .. We will certainly be back "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",My favourite spot.,1,50,20-Oct-15,"I could eat here everyday, such is the variety. Yes there are hawks, hence the name but it's all part of the charm to me.Some of the items on offer are genuinely excellent, and of good value. This the signature centre for a reason and has to be part of your itinerary into SG!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great seafood at Stall 70 - Mrs Tan,1,50,19-Oct-15,"Thank you Mrs Tan for a great meal on Sunday night. Our buttered king prawns with garlic, calamari rings, fried rice and stir fried bok choy were delicious!!! Highly recommend you eat from Mrs Tan at Stall 70 when in Singapore!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food!!,1,40,16-Oct-15,"Been to newtons hawker Center many times over the years. The seafood options are very good. My favourite dishes are the sambal prawns, and Sri Lankan pepper crab!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but you have to pick well,1,40,10-Oct-15,I've been here before but it's always good to visit again. You can get good food here but it's not as cheap as some other places but it's still good value. Just be wary of the touts trying to get you to sit down and they try to order for you. Try the oyster omelette and the chili crab. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit booth #70 - Ms Tan.,1,50,6-Oct-15,"First of all, #70 serves a variety of lovely food in a great and thriving environment you find at Newton Food Center. Second, Ms Tan offers the best hospitality. She is a great mix of being very welcoming and attentive, but on a very comfortable level, as opposed to many others who can be a bit too much. Definitely a place I go to eat every time I visit the city, which I also recommend to all my friends, and now also YOU."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent food and great price,1,50,29-Sep-15,"Great food, recommend you look for the lady who takes care of the seafood, chicken and beer stands. far side from the carpark on the side near the road/roundabout"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must try,1,50,29-Sep-15,"I would move to Singapore again, just to be near the Hawker food. And Newton Circus is one of the best ones in town. The food is fresh, the place is clean, and if you cannot find what you want here - you will never be happy."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoyable experience,1,40,23-Sep-15,"This is safe street food Singapore style. There is a little bit of hustle from the vendors, but too be honest I have had a lot worse in the past. Plenty of food choices, reasonable prices for SG. All three of us ate from different stall holders and a good was quickly delivered to our tables. Worthy of a visit and if you fancy street food then you know you will be safe here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The place to eat in Singapore,1,50,22-Sep-15,"If you ever come to Singapore, this is the place to eat. My husband and I have travelled the world and out of all the places we have eaten, this is our favourite, it is just amazing. The atmosphere is electrifying, it's just buzzing all night long. When you get there just have a walk round the different food stalls to see what you want to eat. You choose a table, all of which are numbered and give the table number to the stall holder and as soon as you have ordered and it's cooked,they bring it over to you. You will be asked by many stall holders to eat at their stall but you can tell them you are looking around and they will leave you alone, they are really friendly. When you have finished your food you can order some more and they bring it over, you pay at the end when you have finished. Our son didn't travel with us on this occasion and he was gutted that we were going to Newton Circus because he loved the food especially sweet and sour chicken. You can buy drink after drink from many stall holders. There are toilets available which are kept clean which is a nice change to some places you may travel. You can catch a taxi just outside the hawker centre. This is a must for anyone wanting to eat with the locals, I can't recommend it enough. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of stalls but mostly same type of food,1,40,21-Sep-15,"Very big food court with lots of stalls. However most of stalls sell the same food with same price. I'd say you have about 4-5 stalls that sell seafood, 4-5 that sell brochettes etc. very nice ambiance. Place is amazingly clean considering the number of people and size of the place. Beware of people at the entrance guiding you to a table. Since they are selling mostly the same food, they literally jump on you to sell you their menu. If you refuse to buy than start the insults...i cursed at the dude for being so impolite and on my way out he started the same manège with other tourists... Other than that enjoy the food!!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visit Mrs Tan at no 70.,1,40,21-Sep-15,"To get a really good experience of a Singapore food court, visit the Newton Hawker centre. I have been there a couple of times now and the food is good. I particularly like Mrs Tan at no.70, especially if you like seafood. The beers & drinks are supplied from next door. Word of warning...you will get inundated by people trying to sell you there food....don't accept the first person, take a good look. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere. Great streetfood,1,40,19-Sep-15,"A must go in Singapore. Experience the hawker streetfood and eat among the locals. Good solid food. Great variety, since 20+ small kitchens and basic seating & eating facilities under open sky. In general only cash payment. Serves beer as well."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great night out, fabulous atmosphere...",1,50,17-Sep-15,"We spend our first evening in Singapore at Newton Hawker Centre, arrived by taxi and found a table. It was very busy with lots of activity going on. Tourists and locals all eating out and the lots of food choices. It was easy to purchase a variety of food and have it brought to the table and accompanied by a cold beer made it a fun night. Chili crab, noodles, skewers, curries, stir fry everything was available to order. Great night out.."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun clean with excellent Street Food,1,50,12-Sep-15,"Recently met up with a number of old school mates for a reunion in Singapore and we decided on having a street food night, Newton Circle came immediately to mind as it is fairly centrally located and is on the main MRT track through town. Arrived around 7pm, already quite busy with many already well advanced in their street food experience. You go around to various food stalls and order what you want, sometimes you need to pay there and then with others you pay when your dish gets delivered. Each table has a number so you best remember that when ordering otherwise you may wait a long time and go hungry. We had a great mixture of Indian and Chinese dishes along with a few plates of very nice chicken satay (always a must!) all washed down with a few Tigers and real coconut milk straight from the coconut. Prices were a little on the high side for street food, but it is a tourist attraction. A fun night was had by all and would certainly head back to Newton Circle next time I am in Singletree."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",#27 Delicious chili crab!!!,1,40,11-Sep-15,I like to introduce my one of favorite chili crab restaurant.I like the chili taste. And I love to eat crab. So Chilli Crab is my best food.That's why I used to go there and eat chili crab even I am alone.This food is very reasonalbe price and also delicious.ANd Korea and Japan tourists come and eat in this restaurant.I truely recommend this restaurant.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good place to experience Asian food,1,40,30-Aug-15,"Had been to this place as it was recommended by several friends and found it really nice, I tried fish head curry (not remembering the stall name) and it was niceIf you are staying in Singapore for long then can mark this place as ""to visit"""
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Another cool food hall,1,40,30-Aug-15,"Okay, this is basically another food hall, but as I have suggested previously I really do love these places, so when I got of the MRT at Newton to visit some place else (Sarkies Road) I decided to step in here and have a look around. Okay, I'm not sure if there is anything in Newton that would attract the average tourist (a category that I generally don't fall into) but the food hall is certainly worth a visit. There are plenty of stalls to chose from, though most of them were closed when I was here (which probably had something to do with the time of day). Still, there was enough available for me to partake in some of the goodies."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Place for Dining Asian Food,1,50,26-Aug-15,"We caught the train from Somerset MRT (Red Line to Jurong East), only two stops and a short walk to the food centre. There is a variety of Asian food available, please walk around and pick the food you wish to eat. We had Chilli Crab from stall 49 (Denmark), the food was very tasty and not expensive. Good value for money, a must visit place in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic selection of Asian cuisine,1,40,21-Aug-15,"With a variety of Asian food on offer it's very hard not to find something not to like. It's a great experience too. It was my Thai girlfriend's first trip out of Thailand, even though she enjoyed the Char Siew pork rice and satay her day was made when we discovered a Thai food stall. All in all a good meal had and thoroughly recommended for first time visitors to Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of the best food centres in Singapore,1,40,20-Aug-15,"Singapore's food centres are always the right places for tourists to enjoy local cuisines. In my opinion, Newton is the best if you wish to taste all signature Singaporean dishes, ranging from satay to pepper crabs, from char kway meow to sting ray at one time. Once you enter the centre area, staff members from different stalls will approach you cordially. Just ignore them until you find a suitable one. After you have ordered a few dishes from that stall, you will then be 'free' to buy food from other stalls and you can enjoy a 'nuisance-free' dinner. P.S. There are always water basins around the corners, so you can feel free to savour the palatable seafood in Newton!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local food scene,1,40,19-Aug-15,"A bit of the local food scene with lots of seafood dishes and a mix of beverages stalls.
A located a short walk away from the MRT and there's lots to choose from."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beautiful Singapore Chilli Crab ,1,40,11-Aug-15,"We came to the Hawker Centre to enjoy a more authentic meal rather than sitting I a high end restaurant ... And we weren't disappointed. After the initial negotiating to get a table we got sorted. Having a range of food and restaurants available, once I ordered from the 'owner' who secured us a table, my husband was able to go off and order what he wanted without the same pressure/hassling. It didn't worry me as I was on a mission to have chilli crab - and it was all I hoped it would be. I was promised that it wasn't too hot - and the promised was fulfilled. The sauce had a bit of a bite, but not too much. The crab had been cracked allowing the sauce to soak through ... So the flavour came through as I sucked out the crab. The only problem was trying to clean myself up afterwards. Little tissues only served as a temporary measure until I could get more serious.Restaurant 43, in a corner with a yellow background is a good place to head! And the Indian next door looked good - and tasted fine according to my husband."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Large variety. Great Indian food.,1,50,10-Aug-15,Great Indian curries (or dozens of alternatives) and ice cold tiger beers (7.50 a large bottle). Fantastic experience. I don't have kids but observed the hawker staff being very friendly and accommodating to the families around me so would say this is a good option for young families. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety and cheap,1,40,8-Aug-15,"The place crowded but fun, because you served with varieties of food, but the famous food here will be singapor carrot cakr and oyster cake. A must try place when you visit singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheaper Eats,1,50,4-Aug-15,"Have dined at Hawker #19 on two separate Singapore trips & the food & service is always spot on! Their Chilli Crab is delicious, messy & affordable!
The nearby drinks stall is always great, super fast & reasonably priced!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great place to experience a hawker centre for the uninitiated.,1,50,20-Jul-15,"Somewhat of a Singapore institution for travellers. A great overall experience of deciding and choosing what to eat and drink, together with great people watching. A great atmosphere. Filled with a good mix of locals, expats, business people out for dinner meetings and of course tourists. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Quality local food,1,40,12-Jul-15,"If you are after an e prince of local food and cheap prices you can not go past Newtons Hawkers Markets in the evenings. There is a large selection of local foods. Do t be stressed out by the pressure of dome hawkers wanting you to sit at there tables to eat you can mix and match. Ethereal were 8 of us and we all got our meals and a couple of beers and soft drinks for $60 total there is a large variety to choice from, I found this to be one of the cheaper quality eateries in Si galore, a taxi should not cost you more then $20 from the central part of Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always a good atmosphere ,1,40,11-Jul-15,Newton might have a reputation of being a more touristy hawker place but so long as you don't mind paying a few extra dollars it's a great place to go. Good selection of stalls (Indian palace is our fave) and they bring the dishes to your table. So no walking around and waiting for numerous different meals for the family. We like!!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",The breakfast of champions,1,50,10-Jul-15,"Having looked briefly at the overpriced breakfast at the Sheraton I walked across the street to get breakfast at the Newton Hawker Center. At that early time there were only a few stands open, among which a fruit/smoothie stand, a noodle and duck stand, a congee stand, and a drink stand. The noodle with duck chunks in a dark soup was spectacular. The coffee was the usual sweet milk Singapore coffee (no espresso makers here). The fruit fresh. The whole thing cost seven singapore dollars, the same as a cup of better coffee in the Sheraton dining room. Hawker centers are a unique (as far as I know) Singaporean feature, and I have never been disappointed. In Singapore I only go to restaurants for the ambience !!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Hawker centre with a bit of space,1,40,3-Jul-15,"Newton Circus Hawker centre is unlike most of the others because it has lots of seating spread out in the centre of the Hawker stalls, that aside the food is the same as all of the others great Sate, Chilli Stingray, BBQ pork and lots of seafood brill!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Market,1,50,29-Jun-15,"We were told the Newton Hawker market or Newton Food center was known for its seafood. We ate here twice for dinner and loved it. We tried chili crab, BBQ stingray, satay, garlic naan and craft (also draft) beer. We went one night at 6 and one at 7 pm. It really seemed to pick up during that hour. At 6 you have a choice of table but at 7, the temperature is cooling off, more stalls are open, our preferred time. The satay was 60 cents with a min of 10 satay. However, I was able to eat 20 satay alone! The chili crab was around $35SD and the BBQ stingray was $22SD. Both were very good. We were surprised by how much we liked the stingray. We weren't bothered by people trying to show us their menu. We just kept walking, grabbed a table and my husband went from stall to stall ordering for our family. We also at at Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell Hawker centers and this was my favorite."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Love the variety of food here! Great for tourists!,1,40,19-Jun-15,This place is great. Must try the stall No 53. The sambal kangkong and BBQ stingray here is awesome. Especially their chili!!!! There are other decent food like carrot cake and XO noodle here as well. Satays and chicken wings are pretty much okay.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",No. 70 Mrs Tan lives up to great expectation,1,40,13-Jun-15,"Having read reviews of the food here, we went along and wasn't disappointed to share an evening with Mrs Tan's attentiveness serving up wonderful food. So good, we'll return again and again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker food at its best ,1,50,7-Jun-15,"A few reviews we saw about this place suggested the food vendors were pushy. We didn't experience any of that. We were able to sit & determine what we wanted which consisted of mutabar, satay and beer (well it was Friday night) and we orders & received all in good time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thoroughly pleasant & filling experience. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good cheap hawker food and beer. A must visit!,1,50,5-Jun-15,"A must visit for all whether you've been before in past years as I have in the 1980's or are new to it. Very good satay, Laksa, seafood etc and beer for $7 a big bottle of Tiger beer! Satay 60 cents a stick (minimum 10 sticks) and so tasty. Very good and very inexpensive in a city which isn't cheap!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",expensive but good atmosphere,1,40,3-Jun-15,"Newton Food Centre also widely known in Singapore as Newton Circus is one of Singapore's more famous hawker centres, it is as popular with tourists as it is with locals. Home to seafood eateries and iconic hawkers like Kwee Heng and Hup Kee fried oyster omelette, While some may find the occasional food tout off-putting, it’s probably the only food centre where you can call ahead to reserve a table with your regular go-to seafood stall and have them attend to you. For beginners, don’t feel obligated to order from the hawker who got you a table, simply decline politely. If you are ordering seafood, watch them weigh it in front of you to avoid a surprise bill. Keep an eye out for the busy lunch crowds, happy family gatherings, and inebriated youngsters starving for some post-clubbing grub. It’s also common to see vendors touting all kinds of food, so walk right on by without making eye contact if you don’t want to be accosted. When you’re here, do order the famous chilli crab and barbecued seafood, and sample a veritable slew of other local delicacies. More than just a hawker centre, the variety of good food and unique atmosphere makes any meal at Newton an experience to remember. This is also a great place to people-watch. It is more expensive than other hawker centres but the atmosphere makes up for it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Organised Chaos,1,50,2-Jun-15,"We went here at about 9:30pm last Thursday night and it was still pretty busy at that time. To get here you catch the MRT to Newton station, take the right hand exit and then turn left out of the station and over the bridge across the road.When you first walk in it can be a bit overwhelming, so I suggest just taking 5 minutes to do a lap of the place and get your bearings. you'll quickly figure out that a lot of the places are selling similar food. We ate at stall 70 (Mrs Tan) and the food was great (was nice to try stingray for the first time!). There is a beer stall next door where you can get some decent priced Tiger Beer and my wife really enjoyed the apple cider too.When dealing with Newton Circus you just need to be prepared to have the touts waving their menu's in your face, each one giving you the quick spiel as you walk past but just keep on walking until you find one you are comfortable with. We really enjoyed the experience and it was good to have a break from the expensive restaurants in the quays. We actually went back for an early lunch a couple of days later at midday on Saturday but most of the stalls were closed."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Will give you a feel of the local food ,1,50,2-Jun-15,"We love the newton circus its great food. So much variety, its not a restaurant to be clear but more like tiny restaurants in a food market atmosphere. You go past each one find the meal you like and you find a table and they bring it to you. They also have a variety of drink stalls. We found the food and drink here very affordable. We only paid $15 Singapore for 2 small meals and a small rice (pretty big portions) and $9.00 for beer (very cheap here). I would highly recommend just for the experience"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A foodies delight,1,40,1-Jun-15,"There are so many vendors from which to choose a massive amount of dishes. We had carrot cake, oyster omelette, sweet and sour and fried rice. All of the dishes offered different flavours, were quickly delivered to the table and of a high quality. Although our taxi driver suggested that it was more expensive and mainly pitched at tourists, we still enjoyed the experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A good experience!,1,40,20-May-15,"We were recommended to visit Newton Hawker Centre buy a people working at our hotel. After a 20 minute walk, our noses told us we had arrived!We were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived as there were so many options. In the end we had chilli crab and fried rice. It was really yum (and messy)!For a large chilli crab and fried rice for 2 it was around 50 Singapore Dollars. This did feel a bit expensive, but I guess it was crab, and everything else was cheap.Would definitely visit again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Pricey, but fabulous !",1,50,19-May-15,"The Hawker Centres are an absolute must for eating out in Singapore, and Newton is our favourite. Located right next to the MRT. Don't expect a cheap meal, but do expect a memorable time with very good fresh food. Take a stroll around the various stalls to check what is on offer, place your order, and then find a seat. You will likely be sharing a table with complete strangers, but that is half the fun. The place gets busy every night, and with good reason. On this latest visit, we opted for Tiger Prawns, with fried rice, and steamed vegetables. The prawns were the size of English kippers (!!) seriously, so we restricted ourselves to 2 each. The stallholder will give you a price for these items before you order so you won't get a nasty surprise at the end of the meal. The prawns weighed in at 200-250 grams each, and cost S$16 each, (about £8 each). Not cheap but a terrific meal in a great location with an amazing ambience. Thoroughly recommended ! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pirate's Seafood,1,50,18-May-15,A must visit place for seafood lovers visiting Singapore..... Located in the Famous Newton Hawker Centre is stall No.56
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Visited back in the 90's! ,1,50,9-May-15,A great food Mecca for foodies!! Must try the real open grilled satay with their own homemade peanut sauce. And there was a Indian guy making the best paratha breads which is like between bread and puff pastry!! Would love to go back again some day!! 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome!,1,50,21-Apr-15,"A bucket list eating experience! It's hot, sweaty, busy but the atmosphere and the food are incredible! Three meals, six drinks, £15. Made on the spot, fresh ingredients and right in front of you, there is something for everyone. Plastic tables and chairs, communal sitting areas, your place is marked by putting a packet of hankies (bring your own!) and putting at a table. Filled with local people, queues at each of the stalks, freshly squeezed juices, ice cold Tiger beer, and not a McDonalds or Nandos in sight! Bliss!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food great price,1,50,12-Apr-15,"Must do in Singapore. Try the bbq'd prawns (chilli sambal or garlic both fabulous) from Gina at Jian Fa they are huge and tasty. And delicious satays from numerous stalls,all great. Couple of beers from Thong Lai stall 41 and your set. Yum. Oh both these stalls give table service ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gotta eat here,1,40,8-Apr-15,"I ate at the pirates seafood, aiming for chilli crab. It was a big, juicy, delicious food. I ordered normal hot one, and it was almost sweet to me. If you're indonesian, 'saos padang' crab is much more tasty n spicy than this. The price is 5sgd/100 g for the crab. A very friendly n hopeful seller.This place is huge, you can find almost ant kinds of food here. Next time i go to sg, i will come here again for different food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, good athmosphere",1,50,2-Apr-15,Most of the time I'm in Singapore I come over at Newton for dinner and I've never been disappointed! Cheap and good food with abundance of variety and the coldest beers in town! It can also be really fun if the stall owners/operators come sit with you! I'll always come back!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Enjoy variety of food here,1,40,24-Mar-15,"Just you get out of Newton MRT station, you will find this eating place. A big complex where on all four sides small stalls sale all kind of food. Local, Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Korien, Thai, Indian .... Soft drinks, beer, and water can be purchased with your food. Clean atmosphere, tasty food. Indian vegetarian food was also available here."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap good eats,1,40,23-Mar-15,"Went here for an early lunch. A fair bit was closed but easily enough to make it difficult to choose. We had a spicy stingray, noodle dish, a buttery chicken. Cant remember everything but overall we were stuffed and very good food. The butter chciken was disappointing and we didnt ask the price before receiving the dish and paid far too much so ALWAYS negotiate beforehand if its not written on the board. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good local food,1,40,9-Mar-15,"Access easy enough via MTR (as long as you come out of the station by the right exit!)Good variety of food, the main benefit being that you can order from one person, and he/she sources the food for you, so you do not have to visit loads of stalls.Make sure you pay for your drinks only once, as we had the feeling we had paid for them with the food, only to be presented with another bill!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for those foodies,1,40,24-Feb-15,"I visited here last year after being recommended to go by my cousin living there. We were taken to her favourite stall and the food was delicious. Being of ethnic origin we did get stared at, however because we knew what it was we wanted to eat and acted accordingly, we were not bothered by any other stalls. There were a total of 6 of us in our group and the food was plentiful and reasonably priced. I would definatly reccomend here if you want to try good local dishes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food!!,1,50,20-Feb-15,"I went to Newton Hawkers for an early lunch and found that a lot of the stalls were closed. A lot of the store owners there try to get you to read their menus and hope that you will buy their food, but I went for the Chilli Crab at Modern Grill Seafood.The service there can be quite crass when you place the order, and it takes a little while for the crab to come out (about 15 minutes, despite the fact it wasn't very busy at all), but I really enjoyed it. The mud crab had lots of meat, great flavour and they give you a bowl of lemon water (and a heap of napkins) to wash your hands after. No utensils given, so you have to use your teeth and hands.The whole crab was $45 including the fried man tou (white buns) which came in ten. The whole thing was delicious! You get your hands pretty dirty though. We also got Iced Teh from Syed Ishak Teh Tarik stall, served by a lovely man! The drinks were fantastic. My sister also had prawn mee, which she really enjoyed.A great Hawkers Center, pretty authentic, nice outdoor area, adequetely clean and it has (like many Hawkers Centres) sinks just out the front to wash your hands in. A quick, convenient place to go for food!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food Food Glorious food!,1,50,13-Feb-15,excellent food and innumerable choices! Right prices and open until late...chilled beer is always awesome
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",NOT AS IT WAS BUT STILL GOOD,1,40,12-Feb-15,"The tourists discovered this place 45 years ago and its still a popular landmark in the Singapore dining scene. I always have the chilli crab from one of the stalls and the grilled prawns , some stir fried veg and I am set. I think the prices have gone from very cheap to really expensive comparatively and it is true you can now get the same thing at other hawker markets for much less . But this is the place to be ."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well Known for Tourist,1,40,10-Feb-15,"Newton Hawker Centre has changed over the years and is now the main local hawker eating place for tourist. The car parking has always been a problem and now coaches arrive even bigger problem. The hawker stalls are really packed and as soon as you step inside their staff are showing you menu's showing you what you can eat showing you to tables near their stalls. You can buy almost any local dish; Chinese, Indian, Malay, and it all has that slight Western edge taste for the tourist. Prices are some what higher than the more local hawker centre's so I'd tend to go to them. Years ago there were a lot of cats around but now couldn't see any which was good. We ordered a selection of local dishes which were plentiful and good, the Tiger beer came in an ice bucket and were the large bottles. As you'd expect service was quick, as there were plenty of people waiting for tables."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ms Tan @ No.70,1,40,26-Jan-15,"We caught the train to Newton and headed straight to Newton Circus for dinner. It wasn't how I remembered it 24 years ago, then it was packed, busy and cheap. Had a stroll around looking at what was on offer and came across stall No.70. We quickly ordered grilled prawn, sweet & sour chicken, stir fried water spinach and Singapore noodles. A cold tiger beer hit the spot on this steamy Singapore night. Our food arrived and the grilled prawn was so big, enough for 1 person, coated in a homemade chilli & garlic sauce, it was so yum. All our food was delicious and just enough to fill us. Ms Tan was lovely, as soon as she said ""yummy yummy in my tummy"" I knew we had chosen well. Look, like alot of others have said, it's not cheap, but it was good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",PEPPER CRAB!,1,50,26-Jan-15,The concierge at the Sands said this is where Gordon Ramsay ventured for Pepper Mud Crab. Who I am to argue? If was awesome. About $40 bucks and thing was alive 1 minute and then in my belly the next.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Old haunt,1,40,22-Jan-15,"Some years ago we lived very close to this hawker centre and called it our local. On a recent trip to Singapore this was the first place we went to once we had dropped our bags in the hotel. It has changed a little and prices have gone up, but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal of chilli stingray, oyster omelette and fried hokkien prawn mee, washed down with Tiger beer and fresh lime juice. We would have loved to have had more dishes but there was only two of us......Yum!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Really good food,1,50,15-Jan-15,"Try the soft chilli crab! Amazing. Loved the food. Upon arrival can be a bit annoying with vendors trying to push their menu's onto them. Just ignore them and quickly find a suitable stall to buy from and once you have ordered, everyone ignores you pretty quickly. It's lovely to sit outside at night. Try the juice place and the natural cane sugar drink, delicious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must visit whilst in singapore for local seafood,1,50,12-Jan-15,"This place is a must visit whilst in singapore, although slightly touristy now as meals are generally around $6-10 where your local hawker stands are closer to $3-5 per meal, it makes for a cleaner and nice environment from which to enjoy your food.The stall holder will shove menu's in your face as you walk past but this is Asia so you should expect this and be comfortable to just wave your hand and say no thank you. This is part of the atmosphere and I wouldn't have it any other way.A must try is the singapore Chilli Crab which will set you back around $35-$40 for a decent size crab and the fried buns $5 which are great for dipping into the sauce.Also of pretty good quality is the satay chicken sticks which are around $0.60-$0.70 each and come with home made satay sauce with actual crushed up nuts in it. This is an easy to eat family favourite, I would suggest that you need around 10 sticks per head to call this a meal or if it's a snack / entree then go for a mixed plate of them so you can enjoy the different types of meat.Another interesting dish that you won't find in too many other places is the stingray, which is extremely tasty."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Grab your table first!,1,40,9-Jan-15,"You MUST visit Newton Circus when you go to Singapore. It's an experience you'll get nowhere else in the world. Hundreds of stalls selling every imaginable food at reasonable (for tourists) prices. The atmosphere is amazing and you'll not be disappointed by the quality or choice of food. The only advice I can give is to go in pairs (at least), walk round first to see what you fancy eating, then one of you grab a table while the other orders from the stalls. This way, you'll not be looking for somewhere to site when you food is ready."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, location and atmosphere!!!",1,40,9-Jan-15,"I am not an expert on Hawker Centres like this but when three of us visited this centre for dinner during our stay in Singapore we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had visited this particular centre about 6 years ago and think it has improved considerably.We had a mixture of seafood dishes of crab, prawns and octopus and all were perfectly cooked and totally enjoyable at a price that we considered reasonable. No 82 was the stall we used and they were good and helpful. The market was clean and maintained that way while we were there.It was also a pleasant experience due to the fact that while the various stall holders touted for your business they were not overly pushy as you might expected from these places. When visiting Singapore in the future will happily pay this place a visit again."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check price before ordering,1,40,31-Dec-14,"Even as a local, I seldom come here to dine as its too touristy and expensive. You can get better quality at cheaper price elsewhere.But the centralized location and atmosphere is good, windy and spacious. Do take note of menu priced as $X/100 grams. These are usually those that rip you off. Or just make sure you ask and confirm the pricing before ordering. Now I see most of the stalls have changed the menu to a fixed pricing. What I've order:Sambal kangkong, fried honey baby squids, sambal stingray, satay, sugar cane juice, fried carrot cake, cereal prawns - total bill of approximately SGD$85 for two pax. Enjoy Singapore! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good seafood and hawker centre,1,40,5-Dec-14,Good seafood and close to my hotel. Price is a bit hiked up due to it being a tourist hotspot nowadays. Stalls are plenty but most are selling same or similar items. Pick any stall and wont be dissapointed. Tips: walk back to Orchard was nice and so do-able.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Buzzing atmosphere,1,50,4-Dec-14,"We made a point of returning to this location because we love the night atmosphere and buzz of activity. This is an open air market with many eating stalls and tables ands chairs in the middle. there is something food wise for all tastes, even a vegetarian like myself. The prices are so cheap, it's crazy. No need to worry about the standard of the food, all good. Just a short train ride to get there. Everyone should experience this once while in singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One stop for all,1,40,2-Dec-14,"Especially for those who are in Singapore on an extremely tight schedule, Newton has always been the place to grab most of the local cuisines at one go. It can be overwhelming at times but I would recommend my friends to venture a little, look at what people order and order the same if it attracts you. Not overly pricey, one can easily be filled up with less than SGD$10 going for one dish items like Ba Chor Mee Pok, Chicken rice, Fried Hokkien mee. But go big a little and try the Sting Ray, my favourite (I always ask for chilli on the side)."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Love the food!,1,40,10-Nov-14,"why would anyone else go to a hawker center if the food is not good? the food there is great, but it's a bit dark and could use a bit more lighting"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious Singaporean Chilli Crab @ Stall 31,1,50,8-Nov-14,"We went there for lunch. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawns, fried rice and fried buns which came to a total of SGD$65. Food was delicious. Very reasonable price compared to big restaurants which charge premium price (Over SGD$200 for the same meal).Definitely worth a try!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Real Atmosphere,1,50,23-Oct-14,"We love Newton Circus, and ate here 3 nights out of a 5 night stay. The satay sticks and chicken wings from stall number 30 are delicious. Add a nice cold beer or juice from Michaels at number 29 a beautiful balmy night and what more could you want?? This is to me what a hawker centre should be and I love the atmosphere and vibe. This is something we just cannot get back home. I think the prices are reasonable. The only down side is some of the more aggressive touts, but just tell them politely to go away and that you will get your own table. Then you can freely look at all of the stalls. There is a good variety of food available. Can't wait to return."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",stall 70 delight seafood - excellent food and great sell,1,50,12-Oct-14,"Was advised to try this place via family friend was not disappointed. Overall the food stalls had a good variety and choice but a few of the hawkers were a bit in your face. After wandering around to get the overall flavour we stumbled on stall 70. Were met by Ms Tan Kwee Gek who charmed us with her sales pitch. After telling us the menu we said we would check out some more stalls but would likely be back. Needless to say we were. We had outstanding tiger prawns with chilli and garlic, fried rice, crispy baby squid and complementary Asian greens The food was great with a beautiful chilli zing, the prawns whilst not cheap were simply to die for. The sales pitch was very good but the food more than lived up to it and actually outshone it. Be sure to take your business card as the lovely lady collects them and is very pleased to show you recommendations from previous clients. If you try the Newton Hawkers centre check out stall 70 and i trust you enjoy as much as wedid."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with the locals here!,1,40,29-Sep-14,"We just had a delicious family lunch here amongst the locals of Singapore and I highly recommend you do that if in town. The closest MRT station is Newton and then a short walk from there. Here is what you do: you look around the whole centre and check out what meal you would like to eat, then you go back to the shop and order from the photo (small, medium or large), they range from $6 to $24 for a plate of cereal prawns, they are yummy, just make sure you ask to peel them first. The shop owner remembers you,tell them where you care sitting and then they bring the food to your table and you pay. We chose Mr Tan from Heng Heng BBQ stall 31 and he is very humble, calm and explains all the dishes without being pushy so I recommend if you want to eat at peace and enjoy local food, go to him. We also enjoyed a cold beer as the beer is very conducive and a good way to digest the food too. There are so many dishes to choose from, we picked the green veggies, cha keow tow, pad tai, cereal prawns and the satays.A tip: take a bacterial gel for your hands and some napkins or tissues. Choose any table under a fan and enjoy!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good eats,1,40,29-Sep-14,"If you aren't a local then be ready to be bombarded with hawker stand owners asking you to eat at their stand. We came for chili crab and we got a feast! We paid about 80 dollars for crab, fried rice and two jumbo shrimps. Not sure if that's cheap... But it was good! We ate at hawker stand 46. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Nicely Different, but be cautious over selling but stall owners.",1,40,23-Sep-14,"In all my years of traveling to Singapore I have never been to a Hawker Centre. It's cheap eating that resembles a food court in an American Mall. I wish I had know about these before, as they could have saved me a whole lot of time and money. A huge variety of foods, that is served quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately we got duped into buying large prawns which were hugely expensive, so make sure you keep track of what you have ordered and the price you ordered it at. I would defiantly go back, time, and time again, but obviously have learned from my previous mistake. Great atmosphere, with locals, expats, and tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Highly Recommended - Satay Sedap (Stall # 67),1,50,5-Sep-14,"Best satays around. At Newton Hawker Centre there a many stalls that offer chicken, beef, and lamb satays, and I've tried most. But Satay Sedap (#67) is the best."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still up to standard,1,40,3-Sep-14,"Returning after 30 years the place still has it's magicThe environment and food greatAs you walk in, you are plagued by hawkers trying to entice you to theirs tall.don't take the first choice, look around, we found stall 70 good value, , however they are all good value."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",VFM!,1,40,28-Aug-14,VALUE FOR MONEY! Spoilt for choice. The street food is safe n hygienic. Cool place to catch up with friends for an informal eve of unashamed gluttony
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Try the bloody mutton soup,1,40,26-Aug-14,"In Malaysia, we also have mutton soup but in this stall, the soup is red in colour and looks kinda creepy but damn it taste so good! There are also a lot varieties there such as korean, western, malaq and many more. Moreover it is very cheap so it's a good place to go if you lose a bet and had to treat your friends."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,1,40,8-Aug-14,great place to visit for authentic Singaporean cuisine and very cheap! All cooked fresh for you ...lots of locals eat there too so that's a good sign.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This place is great! So cheap and great food.,1,50,7-Aug-14,"We went here with friends who are living in Singapore and took us here. Wow, the atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious, tasty and cheap. Make sure you try the stingray and carrot cake (not not actual carrot cake but made with eggs, some sort of dumpling thing, not sure what else but yum). It's authentic, local foods, service is excellent. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",very satisfying dinner,1,40,3-Aug-14,"My boyfriend's favorite food court when he works here. Lots of choices from seafood to noodles to indian cuisine. We had a small potion sting ray ($12), small black pepper crab ($32), a noodle ($10), indian pancake ($4), a beer and a coconut ($11). the place is outdoor. It's a bit smoky and hot, but would like to go back for the food again!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus,1,50,1-Aug-14,Instead of eating at the well overpriced hotel restaurants I would go to Newton Circus_ a food hawker - as they are called locally. The variety of foods amazing! The prices range from cheap to reasonable. The Hawkers in Singapore are well regulated and licensed. Sanitation and cleaniness are not a problem through frequent inspection. I liked the atmosphere as well.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere,1,40,30-Jul-14,"Nice open place with several options of food.
Big tables to share with other people.
I came on a Wednesday night and it's quite full of people.
Prices are a bit expensive comparing to similar food courts."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Satisfied,1,40,23-Jul-14,"After skimming through several mixed reviews, i decided to go and experience Newton food center despite having my local friend said it's a ""tourist trap"".Once i'm there i was greeted by a throng of people. Luckily we got our seats after 5 minutes roaming around. We had chili stingray from the first stall at the entrance, bbq sotong at the stall that has a red LED, and oyster omelette from stall 28 (people say its the best).Price wise there might be cheaper hawker food centers but this one might be one of the most convenient (since its near the CBD), at least for tourists, anyway"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,1,50,21-Jul-14,we just love the assortment of food offered here. great place for dinner hang out after a day's walking tours
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent despite the mixed reviews,1,40,20-Jul-14,"Newtons was located just 2 mins walk from our holiday apartment (Orchard Scott's Residence), having read the mixed reviews on trip advisor we decided to give it a try on our first night in Singapore. The concept is really simple, choose a numbered table then order food from the many different stalls and have it delivered to that table number. The food was cheap, fresh and delicious. The first night we ate ""inside"" surrounded by the stalls, from then on we chose to sit outside close to the car park. The food was so good and the choices so varied we ended up eating from here most nights. Felt very happy to send our children to order for themselves, the stall holders got to know us and were very friendly. Paying at the table means your food is delivered promptly. Ask for cold drinks otherwise they may not be. Fresh fruit chopped to order was a lovely way to finish our meals. Try the sambal stingray, prawn noodle soup, Indian palace, and anything from the outside Thai stall. Despite the number of reviews stating you are hassled at your table we never found this to be the case. There was a polite one armed man selling wet wipe packs who stopped at each table but he was never rude and in fact we began to rely on him being there so we could buy off him. Cheap, cheerful and a great experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","A ""must do"" in Singapore",1,50,15-Jul-14,"Make sure you arrive early to bag a seat at this fabulous food market. Great fun to watch the locals collecting their takeaways for dinner! Each cabin prepares their own speciality and you just choose whatever takes your fancy. The food and drinks are fresh, plentiful an excellent value. You really are spoilt for choice. Everything from fresh seafood, satays, salads, exotic fruits and freshly made drinks."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",marja63,1,50,9-Jul-14,"Food is good and cheap.
You can see lizards and enjoy local envirement.
It`s very easy to get here by tube.
Hawker centre is just beside the MRT station."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun and so much to choose,1,40,29-Jun-14,"We met up with some friends who live in singapore for dinner and they took us here, it was amazing we arrived and a man found a table for the four of us, once establishing what we ate our mate ordered some tiger beers with glasses and ice and then went off to order our food coming back to the table we sat and talked then all of a sudden food started appearing at our table from all the different stalls she went to, it was amazing and so much fun."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",So Much to Choose From,1,40,24-Jun-14,"What a concept... how good would it be to have one of these at home!
Such a variety of food and at a very reasonable price.
People are so friendly and willing to prepare your food exactly how you would like..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Lots of variety,1,40,21-Jun-14,"A must visit when in Singapore. Tried the garlic prawns, Singapore chilli crab, satay, fried rice and the food was spectacular."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",stall 74/76 for food and stall 75 for drink,1,40,15-Jun-14,great chili crab and the girl who was waiting on us was super friendly and non pushy. she actually spent time talking with us.the lady from stall 75 selling drinks was super cute and kept giving us napkins to keep clean.the market itself was super busy and lots of people trying to get your attention.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","try stall 50 .good ,friendly service.affordable n fresh seafood",1,40,10-Jun-14,"i was there with a group of 6 friends. had bbq squids,stingray,tiger prawns at $15 each.very fresh indeed.huge ones.total bill $200 plus.onlyi bypassed stall 46..due to the negative review..but was lucky i settled on stall 50.met alan,the friendly macho guy holding the menu. i am now his regular. bringing my overseas friends/clients often to support him."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious chilly crab!,1,40,4-Jun-14,It was a little confusing at first where to eat but by walking around and seeing which places appeared to be busier than others we managed to find a seafood place.It was an experience to 'choose' our crab and then have it delivered to us! The chill crab was delicious; the soup was just right in consistency and chilliness and was complimented by some fried rice. We then had some traditional tea to end our lovely meal. We did find it value for money because we saw chilli crab advertised outside the centre and it was a lot more expensive than what we paid for.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food..,1,40,31-May-14,"Some Singaporean friends warned me that is is a tourist attraction and may be a tourist trap, but I went to try it anyway. Read some reviews from TA that booth no A1 is an honest vendor, and tried Fried Rice from A1. Huge portion of fried rice (medium size) S$ 8, and I just managed to ate 1/2, took the rest away. I guess small portion (S$ 5) should be enough.Tried Omellete Oyster from other booth but this this tasted so-so, as the oyster is still 'wet' and felt slightly undercooked. Didn't manage to try Ah-Heng carrot cake as it was closed. There were some touts, but you can just say no politely and they were not pushy. Go to this place if you want to try many varieties of Singapore food, the price is fair as many starts from S$ 5."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best Chilly Crabs!,1,40,31-May-14,"We went there for chilly crabs and we were so glad we did ! The seafood is pretty pricey, so don't forget to ask how much it cost and confirm the price as some of the hawkers will increase the price to take advantage of the tourists. The table next to us had some locals were very kindly ordered and negotiated the cost for us...we were very thankful for their assistance. Enjoy your chilly crabs with fresh young coconut juice....refreshing! We will go back on our next visit!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very special place - don't miss it,1,40,20-May-14,"We went there on my husbands business trip to Singapore - I went with him and we combined it with a holiday. One evening we had to go to dinner with his company, and they decided that I had to see this very typical Singapore place with all the different things to eat. We ordered a lot of different food and shared it. I recommend this place - and you'll find your favorite food in one of all the small shops."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun and tasty,1,40,18-May-14,"A friend of mine took me here when I last visited. The set up is fun - you can work your way around trying different dishes from different food stalls, or just chill out at by one stall. A few bottles of Tiger and you're away. Great atmosphere and a great thing to do for an evening during a visit to Singapore. These hawker stall areas are in a number of areas I think, it is just that this is the particular one I went to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Always worth a visit,1,50,5-May-14,"I recently returned from a three week stay in Singapore and ate at Newton Food Centre four times. On two occasions I ate at Ms Tan' (Stall 70) - I had some fabulous huge butter prawns on one occasion and the fabulous black pepper crab on another. Together with some greens and some rice it came to around 40 SGD each time. If you want cheaper then there are many stalls doing Char Kwai Teow etc for 7 or so SDG. I also had a couple of beers from a stall nearby which must be one of the cheapest on the island at 7.5 SGD for a bigger 660ml bottle of tiger. On the other two occasions I ate at the Indian (around stall 40 I think) and had a fabulous keema each time. Again washed down with a big bottle of Tiger. Yes, there are people trying to tempt you as you walk in the entrance but this is Singapore so it is hardly in your face! If you are a new comer I suggest walking around grabbing a table (under cover if rain is in the offing) then ordering a beer. Each of your party can then choose where they would like to eat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent authentic food,1,40,29-Apr-14,"Food at Newton was great, very fresh, cheap and plenty of it. There is seating in the open and undercover and is great for families with plenty of room for the kids to run around. We would recommend the famous chilli crab from Tay at Takara Grilled Seafood, Stall 74."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Don't be shy!,1,50,22-Apr-14,"We were recommended this by a taxi driver who we asked to take us to East Coast. 15 minutes later with a list of what to ask for and how to ask we were dropped off and entered the centre. Its an outdoor hexagon shaped area with seating in the middle and under cover. Probably around 30 restaurants selling seafood and satay etc. We had the chilli crab 38 Singapore dollars and BBQ stingray 18 dollars which was a first and absolutely delicious. Tiger beer must be the cheapest in town 7 dollars for a big bottle. You eat of plastic plates with plastic cutlery, but its an experience that makes a difference and you should try as an alternative or as well as the big seafood places. You won't be sorry. We went as a family of 4 including 5 and 2 year olds and all had a great time."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chilli crab from Mrs Tan,1,40,18-Apr-14,"We have been to Newton Circus many times and it never fails to disappoint. It is always clean and bustling with locals and tourists (although seems to be more locals which must be a good sign of the quality). This time (March 2014) we had chilli crab, Asian greens and Mee Goreng noodles from Mrs Tan in shop 70. Delicious!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Food Court with Nice Food,1,40,16-Apr-14,"When Am in Singapore always indent to visit Newton food court, its one my best choice for Seafood and drinks. Chili or Pepper crab is my first choice, Satay and oyster omelette are my another choice. I love to eat... Yummy foods. Please visit once you be there in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Cheaper Eats in Singapore,1,40,13-Apr-14,"Ah Newton Center after doing the more expensive tourist for show restaurants on one of the Quay's, Newtons is the place to go for good eating at a reasonable cost. Nothing fancy here just good food and cold beers that you can afford."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Food Experience,1,40,30-Mar-14,"You have to try a hawkers market when in Singapore. Take your time to look around, and then let one of the ""hawkers"" help you out. Portions are generous, and going from a small to medium raises the price a lot. We ordered too much for three of us, and had to leave a lot on the table. ""The Pirate's Table"" served a very tasty crispy squid dish -- dinner candy! Get some vegetables -- they are delicious. You eat outdoors at concrete tables and off of paper plates. Bring your own napkins and enjoy an Erdinger beer with your dinner. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, excellent seating area & open past 10 pm",1,50,30-Mar-14,"We ate at Maxwell in Chinatown, Tekka in Little lndia, but Newton was my favouite. The eating area is larger, there were sinks for washing your hands and so much variety. We had excellent Indian food, Malay, Chinese soup and juices (we were a group of 7). Luckily it was also still hopping when we arrived at 10 pm from our transfer from Malaysia. Strongly recommended. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Local delights,1,50,18-Mar-14,Show my Scottish friends some local delights. They seem to enjoy the BBQ Stink Ray a lots. Not to forget the Tiger Beers. Will definitely be back here for more seafood and beers.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Give it a go!,1,40,17-Mar-14,"This place is amazing - if a little touristy. You have to give it a go! Lots and lots of stalls serving everything from fish dishes, curries, to milky tea and ice- cream. Grab a table, get a number, choose from as many stalls as you wish and the food will be brought to your stone table. Everything is outside and the atmosphere is fantastic. Really good fun."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great casual atmosphere,1,40,14-Mar-14,"They are a little pushy, just take your time deciding what you want.
Had the following and it was all great
Stingray with bbq sauce
Mi Goreng
Singaporean Chili Crab
Chicken and beef satays
Chicken Wings"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Touristy but still okay,1,40,1-Mar-14,Order the fried shrimp with egg floss & barbeque chicken wings - they are nicely done in this place. We were lucky that it was a nice cool night but don't go there during rainy season.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good tasty food at a good price,1,40,25-Feb-14,"Ate here twice. All the food was tasty. (Chilli Stingray not our favourite but we gave it a go). Lots of different choices, nice place to sit and easy to get to. (Take red line train to Newton and follow the signs). Prices were quite reasonable. I would recommend the indian in the corner. (garlic naan and masala curry was spicy and delicious."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great experience!,1,40,22-Feb-14,"This was recommended to us and we were greatly relieved to find that the taxi driver knew where it was. He gave us advice, which we heeded, on eating at one of the outer layer of stalls. We talked to locals and visitors, asking them what they were eating, what they recommended etc and ordered some dishes from different stalls to share. They were all freshly cooked and very tasty. The value for money was incredible , the atmosphere was great as was the opportunity to talk to lots of different people about the food that they liked and we enjoyed it so much, we returned to sample more on a second night!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Must Stop In Singapore,1,40,20-Feb-14,Had a great time at this place. Too many choices and lots of repetition from food stall to food stall but the food is local and incredible. You've got to try the chili crab and giant prawns. Wow! Simply incredible.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Try the BBQ stingray!,1,40,5-Feb-14,A friend took us here for BBQ stingray. It came with a spicy sauce but was delicious. We rounded it out with fried rice and green vegetables. You'll be greeted upon entry by a hawker who will direct you to their stall tables but you can buy from anyone.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Improved!,1,40,4-Feb-14,"I used to go to Newton Circus when it was a hawker centre in the middle of a roundabout. It was great! Then they moved it to the 'sanitized' permanent location it is in now and I felt it was a tourist trap of the worst possible type. I had avoided it for years and the then took someone who was in Singapor efor the first time there so they could see it...it was all I feared. But this visit was different - greatly improved - local folk as well as tourists (always a good sign). The food was excellent, touts trying to get you into their particular stalls wer enot too agressive so walk round at leats once and dont forget there is an 'outside row' as well"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for Chilli Crab,1,50,2-Feb-14,Fantastic place to dine along with locals. There are several shops with the similar menu. Chilli crab is very tasty. Bargaining is essential especially for crab dishes. Bill for 2 with drinks ~50SGD
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A great experience,1,40,19-Jan-14,"Met up with friends for a meal on a warm December evening. Warned beforehand that it was very touristy but the majority of people eating looked like locals. Presented with a laminated menu with pictures of the dishes, chose garlic prawns which were enormous and delicious, beef in black pepper sauce - delicious, chicken murtabak - brilliant and fried rice. Complete with beers came to less than £15 per head. Very good value and an interesting experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Yummy yummy in my tummy!,1,50,15-Jan-14,"Delicious authentic food, true delicious fast food! Read all the tips and reviews before and felt ready to order appropriately when we went with our 2 kids. Was advised by a stall owner not to walk around and haggle over price, had also read this before. Headed straight to Mrs Tan at stall 70. What a gem. Ordered plenty under her recommendation but not ridiculous. Absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere. Going back tomorrow. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food for cheap,1,40,11-Jan-14,You can get good and local food but there.It has probably more than a hundred food stalls there so you have a lot to choose from.But dont make the same mistake as us and go there for lunch. A lot of the stalls will still be closed by then since people go therer for dinner.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Overpriced but not too bad,1,40,10-Jan-14,"This hawker centre seems pretty famous, especially among tourists. At dinnertime, maybe 50% of the customers are Caucasian. The food is highly varied from seafood to cuisines of all different cultures, but the price is probably almost double that you would find in other hawker centres. I've had some pretty terrible seafood there, and my Singaporean friends tell me that the seafood there is not particularly good but worth a try I guess. The non-seafood dishes I've had there are very good through, and the difference of a few dollars I'm not too fussed over. Overall definitely worth a try."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",good value for money,1,40,5-Jan-14,"plenty of stalls to choose from. don't get intimidated by those who approach you. you can sit anywhere and order from anywhere. must try oyster omelet, stingray (tastes like tuna), chili crab, bakuteh, well almost everything is good!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Frozen beer,1,50,16-Dec-13,When you go for a hawker style diner. you wont expect to get good service usually hawkers just give u want u ask for and mind their own business not here. when asked for a cold beer they gave me frozen beer which is extremely amazing to have at this warm climate at $7 for 640ml... who wants to leave..... the food all around is all great. though they have their sections cut out each respective stall has its own area.. i go here every month a universal place for every occasion..
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",OMG WAT A GEM PLACE TO EAT LOCAL,1,50,15-Dec-13,Absolute a brilliant find that is easy from the MRT at Orchard and one stop away. you just need to follow the roundabout road to go over a walking fly over to reach it.Every trade stall holder was so astonished that you had arrived there and boost about their chef talents.. Best tasting fish ever!!! and in some case paid no more than the equivalent one pound for a meal.....
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap and plentiful,1,40,21-Nov-13,This hawker centre was close to our hotel and had been recommended by an expat friend. We found out from local colleagues that it tends to get better reviews from expats than locals who don't think it's as good as other hawker centres in Singapore. For us it was convenient but also had great seafood dishes that were very reasonably priced. It was clean and had a really vibrant atmosphere. It's also open until late at night - some stalls stay open 24/7. Worth a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Store 70,1,40,16-Nov-13,"Recently had a meal at Newton hawker centre. Store 70 was the best. A must for service and quality. We could not fault the meal, plus we ordered food from another stall which they work together, this made for a memorable meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Shop 66 for Chilli Stingray,1,50,13-Nov-13,"If you head to shop 66 for the best chilli stingray, I always go back there to Stanley when I'm in town. Love this with a nice cold beer! Its really just a local outside food court with the best chilli stinray."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great place for indian food!,1,40,12-Nov-13,"Been living here for the last 2 years and have found this place to be close to food from home!A great ambiance and superb sevice , Mohan who is the owner knows how to make you come back for more ! A must visit place for Indians in singapore :)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food and inexpensive, if done properly!!",1,40,6-Nov-13,"We ate here twice as it was close to our hotel, just a short walk from Newton MRT station. The first night we were silly and let one of the stall holders show us to a table and pressure us into ordering way to much food as well as garlic tiger prawns which although absolutely amazing, almost doubled our bill!! The next night, after reading up on how to do it properly, we chose a table then went up to order dishes from various stalls. This way you get exactly what you want and know exactly how much you owe! A nice mix of tourists and locals eating, which is always a good sign! "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Stall 70 Seafood,1,40,2-Nov-13,"Some seagood is sold by weight so be aware for lobster & tiger prawns, otherwise price known before ordering. Mrs Tan will do gluten free sauces or hold on the side, no-one else understood our request. Yummy, quality fresh fish. Search carefully as some venders don't have the same quality (frozen). Walked from the Royal Plaza (fantastic) on Scotts. Great local experience..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food but be careful!!,1,40,27-Oct-13,"Silly little me got a bit carried away and forgot to ask for the total before ordering our food. The bill was double what we should have been paying so please be careful as the stall owners are trying to pull a fast one on tourists. But in saying this we took our time and picked the food we wanted to eat, it was delicious, well cooked and full of flavour. We had Black Pepper King Prawns and Chilli Sqiud plus a couple of mammoth Tiger beers. I still enjoyed the experience even tho we were swindled for a few extra dollars. Fair play! Haha"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Singapore chilli crab,1,40,19-Oct-13,"Looking for a traditional Singapore dish on our last night in Singapore we took a taxi to Newton food market. The place was packed full of locals and tourists. We were soon shown to a table by one of the over eager stall owners touting for business. We ordered Singapore chilli crab and Hainanese Chicken and was not disappointed. The crab was fresh hot and spicy with the contrast of chicken mild and moist We had a selection of noodles, rice ,vegetables and Tiger beer total bill came to 60 Singapore dollars. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Singapore and enjoyed the atmosphere and found the locals in Singapore very friendly and polite. ( Travelling onto Australia Brisbane, Surfers Paradise )Neil and LouiseBlackpool"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",not bad,1,40,17-Oct-13,"a good place to visit if you like to mingle with and eat like the locals. there is plenty of choice, however, be prepared to be pressured into buying from particular vendors. I guess that's why they call it a hawkers centre. you cannot walk 5 feet without being approached to eat at their food stall. a good and vibrant atmosphere and worth the visit if not just for the experience."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Beware of touting, do not settle for the 1st stall owner who approaches you",1,40,17-Sep-13,"I'm staying at Singapore and hardly dine at Newton Food Center since it's notorious for overcharging. However, the coach that I took returning from Malaysia stopped at Newton, I decided to settle for a quick dinner. The last time I came here was years ago...My 1st impression was touting is so rampant here, something that is so rare in Singapore.My advice for visitors, especially tourist from overseas, DO NOT settle for the 1st stall owner who manage to find you a seat. You are absolutely free to sit anywhere and order from any stall.I also realise that those who were touting are all the seafood stalls holder. From my observation over an hour there, many tourist actually ordered only seafood from the stall holder who found them a vacant table and gave many other nice food a miss since they didn't even walk around the food center.Please walk around and choose other food as well besides seafood, which is way overcharged at Newton Food Center and does not really taste good."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",One of my favourite hawker centres,1,40,14-Sep-13,I first discovered this hawker centre the first time I came to Singapore and it's still just as good value and has such a wide variety of food as it ever had! Just a short walk from the Newton MRT station! Thoroughly recommended to all visitors to Singapore!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Must eat here!,1,40,12-Sep-13,"Visited Singapore 4 times in the last 4 years and every single time have stopped for a meal at Newton circus. Nearly all the hawkers sell the same food, however i go towards the ones that sell more seafood. Fried rice, Prawns , even the veggies are fabulous. Open till quite late , fun to sit outside with the place being always crowded. Decently priced as well. Must eat here atleast once when you visit singapore"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Check out Denmark Seafood #49,1,50,9-Sep-13,"Asked a local cab driver to take us to somewhere to eat good crab, and he bought us to the Newton Hawker Centre. After being hassled by several very pushy restaurant touters, we started speaking to San from Denmark Seafood who was friendly, polite & great to deal with.We had chilli crab, black pepper crab, tiger prawns that are bigger than your hand & some greens, and a few tiger beers for good measure. We left full & satisfied, and for a lot less than we paid at no signboard seafood the night before."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",It's a must!,1,50,7-Sep-13,"Yes I know the locals will say its not authentic enough and way too pricey! But it must do something right when it's been here for decades and still one gets an excellent meal for good prices. My recent visit happened on a Friday night, filled with families and friends all feasting on crabs, lobsters, shells and the typical local fair. Each stall will bring the food to you, which is what I love about street food here, one doesn't need to navigate the crowds to find a seat and then try to not spill your food. We had giant grilled prawns, a round of satay and vegetables. Tasted great and the along with the atmosphere a must for not only those living here but the tourist as well. For the tourists have no fear, it's clean, all B ratings, friendly and has bathroom amenities too."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Singaporean Food,1,40,5-Sep-13,"If you want to try out some authentic food of Singapore, this is the place to be. This is quite famous for being there for decades now, and I first found out about it from my dad who went there in the 1990s. I've been there twice, each of my two SG stay. It is like a giant outdoor foodcourt where tourists and locals alike eat and drink. Owners will enthusiastically call and encourage you to buy from their booths as you pass by them. However, we were stopped by a local owner who called out that were Filipinos, and continuously said ""Masarap alimango"" (translation: delicious crab). We were taken to a table, followed by the food owner with it's graphic menu and detailed prices. This made us communicate with each other easier. We wanted something else not on the menu, so he referred us to his co-seller. The food would be delivered to our table, and we had to pay up immediately. What we ate: Cereal Prawns, Chicken and Pork Satay, Chinese-cooked Cabbage, and Yang Chow Fried Rice. (During my first visit, we ordered Chili Crabs and Lemon Chicken). Overall, it was a good experience as we savored our food up to the last bite. We spent around 10 sgd each.The only thing I'd like to comment is that it's quite tricky going there using the MRT or Bus. Make sure to memorize the bus numbers or train station you'd get off to."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",good choice for hawker center,1,50,1-Sep-13,"clean, convenient location, non offensive /aggressive barkers, over all good choice, Not sure if true but we were told this is only open at night"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap local food!,1,40,28-Aug-13,"Excellent local food! Cheap if you don't mind the ambience. Beers are extremely cheap! Had a local Tiger beer and a Heineken and still had money in my pants!!!! Try the sambal stingray.... I know, sounds strange but its awesome! a little bit spicy but what the hey!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Save some cash and sample new tastes,1,40,26-Aug-13,"Experience a little atmosphere in a tourist-safe area. Try some dishes without breaking the bank. Hawkers from individual stands will try to convince you to eat in their booth, but be patient and walk around until you see something that interests you. Hawkers are assertive but not aggressive. Be sure to establish the price as you order, not afterward. Dont rely on the posted price."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Terrific local food, but watch the prices",1,40,25-Aug-13,"Loads of local food here, but many repeats among the vendors. Find a place and go back. Vendors will remember you and give you great service next time. Be careful about the seafood prices. Veggies and chicken are inexpensive here, but many of the seafood items can be quite pricey. You may enjoy a few jumbo tiger prawns then find out that plate cost $50. Discuss with the vendor beforehand so you aren't surprised.We particularly enjoyed sugar cane juice with lime or lemon from the juice stands, to go with our food. Great place!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good food, moderately priced, good evening atmosphere.",1,40,24-Aug-13,"We went with locals, were met by people keen for you to eat their food. Good humoured and not pushy. Order your food, give them your table number and your food arrives pretty promptly having been freshly prepared. Great calamari, garlic prawns, vegetables and rice. Naan and dhaal.Locals definitely are here plus a handful of tourists."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Circus food hawker centre,1,50,16-Aug-13,If you are looking for where the locals go to eat - try Newton Circus - train to Newton Circus walk to the overpass and there is it - one of the biggest selection of food hawker shops available in Singapore. Try Chili or Pepper crab - choose your own live crab - butter prawns or the grilled Malaysian sting ray. YUM YUM YUM.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must for foodies,1,50,15-Aug-13,good food with varieties to choose from. have to check the price before you order any seafood items or it might turn out to be a little over your budget.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Is not the cheapest but good quality!,1,40,4-Aug-13,"The best part of this hawker center is that they close late. They have the main singaporean delights, really clean and nice setting."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",straight simple cheap,1,50,1-Aug-13,"after a late night out the best place to grab a wholesome meal is right here, the food is amazing and you get a wide variety, at 2.30 am the place was very busy, we stuck to simple food, fried rice, prata, sweet and sour chicken and nasi gorang all in 20$ amazing"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap food,1,40,27-Jul-13,"We ate here twice, with our 3 children. Had amazing mee goreng and murtabak. So cheap, cost $20 to feed our whole family. You need to ignore the tauters, the stall owners are not supposed to approach you with menus but some do. We didn't find it too busy but we were there by 6.30pm, if you eat later it can get very busy. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Convenient location, good food",1,40,15-Jul-13,"Even if people complain that the the newton hawker center is overpriced, touristy, etc, etc... One can't deny that it is convenient to get to and is quite near orchard road. It is still reasonable but like any other similar eating places around the world, you should watch your bill and what you are paying for.Just went during the day with a lot of stalls closed. To get the full experience, it is recommended to go in the evening 7pm onwards. Ended up eating and getting my favorite stingray and sambal kangkong in stall 53. It was very good, decently priced, and surprisingly - the owners were very nice and friendly! Also left my bag in front of their stall and the female owner was nice enough to see it and hold it for me.No matter what people say, the convenience of newton circle for me is the main draw."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Get into the Singapore vibe!,1,40,8-Jul-13,"You must experience this hawker centre on your visit to Singapore, it is truly unique and pleasantly surprised at the range of foods, cultural differences mixing with the locals. We avoided rush hour and had a late lunch around 2:30pm, no the queues! We had the fried kway Tao a Singaporean speciality, the chicken rice was to melt in your mouth, the satays fresh and tasty, roti with peanut sauce, the vegetables so green! All washed down with a cold icy tiger beer, you need this! Thoroughly recommend you do this, we are doing it again. Take tissues to mark your table and wipes for cleaning afterwards. There are ceiling fans but its all in the open air. It cost us sgd$15 per head including a large beer."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",an amazing city for food,1,40,26-Jun-13,"every stall got a tasty favours that make us go again and again. the only problem is that they don't have tissues for the customers.
thanks alot for the very nice food."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Favourite for >35 years. Still Excellent!,1,50,26-Jun-13,"I've been going to Newton since 1977 when I began going to a school in the area, and it's still my hawker centre of choice when I return from my new home in Melbourne.It may be slightly more expensive than other more-local hawker centres, but it offers a great array of choice and the food is generally of very good quality. Singaporeans will sometimes complain of quality on the basis that locals often look for 'best of breed' in dishes, and Newton may not have a replica of ""mum's lamb roast"". Having said that, as far as I am concerned Bee Heng Popiah and Heng Carrot Cake (try the white version with chilli) are outstanding, and the best of their kind in Singapore. Wash those dishes down with sugar can juice and it'll cost you $10-15 at most and put a wide smile on your face.Is it touristy (as is the occasional complaint)? All of Singapore is, and not more so at Newton. In fact, it's typically filled with locals until about 10pm, when more tourists start filing in.Newton has never disappointed me (except when my favourite stalls are closed! - I think on Tuesdays). Don't miss it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Please read you wont be disappointed,1,40,23-Jun-13,I used to live around the corner form newton circus hawker center - I've probably eaten here 100 timesEnter on the bukit timah rd entrance and walk along the outside and right before the end you can turn in on your left - dont turn in but sit down there as there's a great juice stand and next door is the seafood place where you should order1) bbq sting ray2) satay but you have to walk in and find a malaysian satay stand as their satay is always tastier than the thai/chinese/indian stands as they use a better marinade3) try the oyster omlette something different but a must try if you're in singapore4) the locals say try chicken rice i think its the most overated local cuisine ive ever tried same with the chili crab a local delicacy - i would stay clear of both of them5) get a chicken fried rice 6) get a bak choy or stir fry beans to go with the sting ray and rice and satay (beef/chicken/venison get 6 of each to try)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Slightly off the tourist map, but totally worth visiting",1,40,22-Jun-13,"Take the MRT, and walk the rest of the way – it's totally worth it. The food and drinks are excellent and cheap. You get a sense of the local culture at Newton Circus. I always cherish opportunities like this whenever I travel - a chance to interact with the locals on their turf.Mind you, being a foreigner, you will get harassed by the hawkers to try their stall over their neighbours. Other reviews dwelled a bit much on the pushiness of the people. It's not as bad as they make it sound."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Handy for lunch / early evening local food,1,40,10-Jun-13,"Easy to get to (walking distance from Orchard Scotts residences where we were staying), and with many options for local street food. Cheap and cheerful, but with friendly service - a number of the vendors remembered us after only one or two visits."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good memories on top of good memories,1,50,3-Jun-13,"I first ate here a few years back with a friend and I loved the wide variety and the taste of the food in spite of the then crude appearance of the place.This time, I came back with my husband, kids and a small group of close friends and was pleasantly surprised. The place had been renovated, and very well, I must say. The food stalls are now at the periphery and the tables are in a central open-air area. It encourages socializing.Upon entering, one is assaulted by all kinds of delicious smells. Of course we knew that it would be impossible to order everything but we certainly tried--crabs, fish, chicken, squid, oysters, pork, beef, mixed satay and shellfish. The food was not fast but was well-prepared.There was no one trying to hurry us up. We were able to catch up uninterrupted. The only drawback to the evening really was the heat. Summer. Unfortunately, no electric fans in the open air part. But the food and the ambiance made one willing to sweat it out. So my previous memories of great food have now been reinforced with more memories of great food AND ambiance. Newton will definitely be on our itinerary the next time we're in Singapore."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food and atmosphere,1,50,27-May-13,A very relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere at this clean food centre. Food is inexpensive and delicious!! Particularly the chicken murtabak.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Eat with locals,1,50,23-May-13,"This place is buzzing, plenty of choices and cooked fresh, we were told to get price of food before buying to make sure not to pay too much. But we had no problems"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood haven,1,40,22-May-13,Just be careful - always ask for prices first before ordering!! We spent quite a hefty bill normally spent on 5* restaurant.. But the food was absolutely delicious
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A Singapore food institution,1,50,23-Apr-13,"Yes it is usually hot and humid, and by no means a high dining experience, but the chili crab is to die for (approx 30-35 SGD for a whole crab) and it is always great food. Very family friendly, and wallet friendly too. Always try the fresh lime juice to wash it all down."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Local food and fun,1,40,17-Apr-13,"Hawker areas which frequent Singapore are great places to enjoy the local cuisine in a relaxed outdoor atmosphere. Newton Circus is only a short walk from the Newton MTR station. One word of caution – the food in hawkers is generally very reasonably priced except the large prawns and the chili crabs – Singapore specialities. All food is a stated fixed price except these items which are by weight. Make sure if you want these items, you ask for them to be weighed in front of you and ask what the total price will be. Many unsuspecting customers have been shocked by bills totalling several hundred dollars when they thought they were having a “cheap” meal. It is common for the weights to be exaggerated if you are not careful and have the items weighed in front of you. Do not let this detract from trying one of these areas though as everything else is really cheap and the food is amazing."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Ikan bakar,1,40,27-Mar-13,"hot and spices Ikan Bakar and lala, I like. too many variety sometime don't know what to eat, but is a nice place to go.Why Singapore Seafood so expensive...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",A must do thing for all Non - Vegetarian Sea Food Lovers,1,40,17-Mar-13,I like the food.... but some might not like the rush atmosphere. But its a good experience and different kind of taste compared to many other places.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hawker Food,1,40,15-Mar-13,"Fish Ball Noodles and Roasted Chicken Wing are awesome. When ordering BBQ seafood, best you ask for the price before ordering."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Amazing local food under one roof,1,50,12-Mar-13,I visit the food court once a month or so. Love the spread and ambience. Best dish so far: BBQ StingRay.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Open stalls with various selection of food,1,40,26-Feb-13,"Good place to hanging out & try local delicacy. But be prepare of the hot, smokey, busy & noisy situation.I was pretty disturbed with all the stall staff which tried to promote their menu and sometime pushy. Try the sting-ray fish (I can't remember which stall), but I try two different stall & both taste good. I must be lucky.There's stall named Indian Palace which totally match to my taste. I always afraid to try Indian food because of the heavy spices & bad aftertaste. This one taste mild but so good & pretty authentic, it still leave a spice aftertaste, but not as bad as I thought."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An old Reliable,1,40,26-Feb-13,We revisited Newtons Circus after my first visit 25 years ago and I went to re taste my initial dish from then - the Mutton Murtabak . I found it and was not disappointed . Cold Beers Hawker Food on only 1 watch salesman!!! Gotta love Singapore
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Beware but good food if you know the place,1,40,25-Feb-13,"This is a classic touristy place in Singapore but that doesn't mean all the stalls serve touristy food. I lived in Singapore for two years and have visited other times and still enjoy the experience here because I can get all the food I want in one location. I would steer clear of the seafood as there are better places to get it but the carrot cake, Kway Teow, and Chicken Wings are all good. I also like the big area and that they deliver to your table. This is a good place for a tourist to wet their appetites but beware of price and quality."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food!,1,40,12-Feb-13,The selection of food was great and the prices were very reasonable. All the stalls were extremely clean and hygienic!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton Hawker Center,1,50,7-Feb-13,"This was where we eat the first night in SG, it was a nice experience, though it is a hawker center its clean, and food is great. The place is just near Newton station, exit A..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth the visit,1,50,6-Feb-13,"While holidaying in Singapore we took our friends to the Newton Hawker Centre as this was their first visit. They were amazed if not a little cautious at what was on offer. We picked a stall and feasted on a variety of dishes from king prawns (they had never seen ones so big), a mixture of satay and some other tasty dishes. They said it was the best meal they had ever had. We were looked after so well. We know we paid far more than what the locals would but we realised that being tourists they were likely to put their prices up. When comparing it with what you would pay in Australian dollars we were still very happy and would still go back again. An experience worth having and no, none of us got sick, for those who are apprehensive about eating at these places."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Best food in Singapore!,1,50,29-Jan-13,"Having a great selection of foods you will not be disappointed!My favourite being the Chilli Stingray, and sweet chinese buns! I was brought here by friends from Singapore and they tell me that it is the best food. There are other hawker stalls and other places you can get the same dishes - but you can get everything here and eat all at one table!Top tip - make sure you shop around, a lot of stalls sell similar foods so make sure you ask the price before you commit!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of seafood,1,40,29-Jan-13,"If you're looking to experience a wide range of seafood, then Newton Hawker Centre is the place to go. So many stalls offering a great selection of seafood. The prawns and satays are definitely a must. I would recommend having a look around all the stalls before you decide what and where you want to get the food from. Be aware of people coming up to you asking if you need a table etc - once you say yes, they'll show you to a table then hang around getting you to order food with them. It got a little annoying after a while. You shouldn't really have trouble finding a table so it's probably easier to order the food yourself (just know your table number before you order food because generally the stall vendors will tell you they will bring the food to you). Overall it was a very enjoyable night and I definitely preferred Newton to Lau Pa Sat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection,1,50,21-Jan-13,My favourite place for Sting Ray. Like many of the Hawker Centres in Singapore the seating is basic but oh the food! Get a taste of how the locals dine out. :-)
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",thumbs up!!,1,50,11-Jan-13,"Most of ma friends says the food now is not as great as how it used to be..
I still like the food there..great Seafood!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Good service, great food",1,50,10-Jan-13,"Great atmosphere, food was fresh and quick.
BYO available.
The staff were helpful and informative.
ATMs on site.
Good toilet facilities.
Easy to access by MRT, taxi and bus."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful local fare - fabulous fruit,1,40,2-Jan-13,"We went for an evening meal here courtesy of a local Singaporean couple who we had met several times over the years. We had never eaten at a Hawkers Market away from Orchard road. The food was wonderful, our hosts treated us to a selection of local dishes in this bustling location. I would visit again on our own but would not have been too confident going there for the first time without local company. I didn't know most of the dishes and there are touts who try to push menus, if I had been alone I would have thought they were waiters of some sort! Be firm and a bit wary of being taken advantage of and it is a great place with great food. The fruit stalls on the outer rim of the Market were incredible, selection, quality and quantity - on our next visit it is firmly on our list of places to eat."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Wonderful food and beer is a fair price,1,40,19-Dec-12,I have visited several times over the years. The food is still excellent. Take time to wander around before making your selection and don't buy everything from one stall. Particulary recommend the satay from a small stall in the far corner (near the loos).Large bottles of Tiger beer were selling for S$6-50 each - great value when compared to the S$15 to S$18 per pint chargred by many of the bars.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Sting Ray Tastic,1,50,18-Dec-12,"Yes it's the 'touristy' place, but also mobbed by locals, hell pay a little more and you'll still enjoy it.
Chilli Stingray especially good. Poh Pia too"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lively atmosphere, fantastic seafood!!",1,50,17-Dec-12,"Always love Newton for seafood. Will always have the bbq stingray, boiled gong gong, cockles and chilli crab whenever we are there. And they have halal-certified stalls. Luv luv!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Food/Hawker stalls...,1,40,14-Dec-12,"This place has turned into a place for tourists. It used to be one of the premier places to go for hawker stall experiences but now, the costs are up there and it seems to be all tourists. Which is ok. But I live here and there are just too many places that are similar that don't cost anywhere near the same. (Chinatown for one). The food is good and you get decent service but.. well, there are other places to go. If you do want to go and see it.. go in the afternoon or very early evening to miss the crowds. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Tons of variety, casual, affordable",1,40,4-Dec-12,"Real Singapore Hawker experience, large with many varieties of cuisine, it can be hard to make a choice. Food is all affordable and tasty and casual."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Probably still the most well known Hawker Center in Singapore,1,40,25-Nov-12,"The place is a little pricey compared to other Hawker Cennters in Singapore and reputation recently blemished by overcharging foreign visitors. However, I still think you get the best food varities here and quality are very good. It shouldn't be missed by any overseas visitor and make sure you check the prices before ordering. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Seafood Hawker Central,1,40,21-Nov-12,"Probably 70 stalls selling fresh seafood can't be beat. Butter Prawns, pepper crab, grilled tiger prawns, the list goes on. If you don't like seafood probably not the place for you."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Back again,1,50,16-Nov-12,"Not sure why people do not like newton circus/food center. Great atmosphere, my wife & I have been going here for over 20 years. You can buy cheaper food I agree at food courts, but they are so bland & the cleaning is very dubious. When entering, do not sit where the first person tells you to sit, just walk around looking & what is available. Be polite they are trying to run a business in a competitive market. Normally you get 3 serve sizes to choose from. We have only ever had seafood, eg prawns on a couple of occasions, as that is expensive, but if you want tiger prawns, ask them to weigh in front of you. Garlic style is the best. My favorite is Mr Lee at stall number 46. Pepper beef. Calamari was OK but the batter was a bit thick. In the end we had 4 choices that cost $65 sg.Ice cold tiger beer @ $6.50 for a large bottle."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Unique Singapore Hawker Flavour,1,50,1-Oct-12,"The diversity of the hawker ambient is unique. Price of the food is more expensive than a regular hawker, however the superb variety and food quality offered by the hawkers gave Newton a deserving and accliamed reputation."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great atmosphere,1,50,30-Sep-12,"Great food, when you arrive a 'helper' attaches himself to you, he then finds you a table, a menu, drinks and brings back what ever you want! Great experience and a bit different as well"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Chinese / Malay Cuisines,1,50,23-Sep-12,"must eat 1st class indonesia barracuda fish slices in soup,seafood carrot cake and oyster egg omelette , excellent chineses bbq satay and also malay satay"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great selection of restaurants,1,40,12-Sep-12,"If you want to feel the vibe of being in Singapore, this is a nice place to visit especially for the first timers. Just choose a restaurant and sit down nearby, and the staff will come to you with a menu and all. You pay to the staff directly after every order."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Very good food and affordable price,1,50,7-Sep-12,"One of the food stalls is a very delicious and cooked very well.You must try at stall no. 46 the JIAN FA SEAFOOD BBQ. Very excellent food. Specially the steamed fish is the best, also you must try the crunchy cuttlefish and stirfry kang kong. And sure you come back..."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",everyday !!,1,40,5-Sep-12,Almost everday we going to Newton Hawker Centre after work... well well this a place we need to go chill out after work!.. after all long tired day this is the best place to chill with work mates! the food was good too no doubt !
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great fun!,1,40,26-Aug-12,"This is a must visit. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. Lots of choice, worth a wonder round to see everything on offer. Pick a table, then go buy your drinks and food. Top tip: agree a price before ordering anything priced on weight. Try the chili crab, peppered squid, and the jumbo prawns."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food but tricky hawker owners,1,40,20-Aug-12,Great variety of seafood choices but be sure to at least have a good indication of the prices. Hawkers at Newton Hawker Centre is well trained in tricking tourists into expensive dishes or ridiculous price calculations. A seafood meal for two should not exceed SGD$60.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",For a quick taste of Hawker and local food,1,40,16-Aug-12,"Yes, its a touristy and yes some elements are more expensive however if you want a quick look at Hawker style food, all sorts of local SE Asian cuisane, in a relatively family friendly enviroment then go Newton. Just as long as you dont take it all too seriously is a nice place to go. Restaurant owners will always annoy you however this is Asia and it happens, English is no problems.We go quite often when we feel like jsut getting out for a quick eat.We normally take a bottle of wine with us to eat as well and buy a beer to start then crack open some wine and they generally are OK with it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fun experience but be savvy about seafood prices,1,40,7-Aug-12,"A fun dining experience is to be had here. The hassle from restaurant proprietors is a bit overwhelming, so best to research and know which one you're going to.Singapore chilli crab was magnificent! Also had lobster. Check total price before agreeing to buy seafood. $6 per 100g sounds cheap but when you get brought over a kg lobster which you weren't expecting, it can get a bit pricier than anticipated.But overall such a fun experience. And did I mention the Singapore chilli crab ??"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Food,1,40,3-Aug-12,This was a fun and easy night with our guests from Australia. Food was great and atmosphere was good too
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cant get enough,1,50,3-Aug-12,We loved it all especially the variety of dishes and the very very cold beer to wash it all down. An absolute must for all travellers to Singapore or rest assured you will feel that you have missed out on a spectacular culinary experience.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, cheap eats!",1,40,1-Aug-12,"We were recommended to go there, we had great food but wished we had of been stronger to stop Restaurant owners approaching you (although there are signs that say they cannot). It all looks good but you have to enjoy the hawker style eating outdoors to feel comfortable. It would be even better if you could speak their language! I wished we had eaten at the Crab place but maybe next time. Taxi to get home to Hotel was a bit of a wait. "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good Food,1,40,24-Jul-12,Some really good Asian food here. Chilli crab was delicious. Not cheap but reasonably priced for and cold beer. Worth a visit.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Posh Hawker center,1,50,23-Jul-12,"among all hawker centers in Singapore, this is the most posh place. Food are great but be prepared cos its a little more pricey compared to the others."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Gerat but be aware of what you need to do,1,40,22-Jul-12,"This is a Singapore must do. But there are a few rules:1. NEVER listen to the touts as you come in, just smile and nod, if they touch you just say ""molest!!"", they will back off,2. Get a table, leave someone there and go around alook for food,3. the drink sellers will come to your table - buy from them but check the price first - they all speak english, if they dont, then order from someone who does,4. NEVER buy from food touts - they will cheat your blind on price and demand S$ 45 per prawn or something ridiculous - these guys prey on stupid tourists,5. NEVER order unless you have an agreed or signboarded price,6. If you have any hassles, then get the stall number or the touts number. If they become agressive, call 999 and the police will come. I have called 999 many times and the cops here are excellent at sorting this thing out. Just DO NOT BECOME AGGRESSIVE OR SWEAR/OATH.My personal favourite is Ah Hengs carrot cake - it is a good mate and he knows all the people there. Just remember that it is a game for the touts etc. just smile and ignore them. But be careful of some of the local partons especially late at light. They can be very nasty.Selamat makan...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",great food,1,50,17-Jul-12,The food was very fresh and reasonably priced and extremely tasty and the beer was very cheap. I would certainly eat here again
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Tourist Trap? NOT! Quality at a good price!,1,50,15-Jul-12,"Most people will say that Newton Hawker Centre is a tourist’s trap. But I highly beg to differ. Unless you’re looking to have shark’s fins soup and abalone, almost every other thing that you can find there is of a fixed price. Just check before you order and you should be fine. I’d actually think of this place as a place offering one of the better quality seafood in town, because with so much competition, you’d have to stand out in order to survive!One thing to note, the minute you enter the hawker centre, you’ll be bombarded by tones of people holding menus from all the various stalls, touting business from their prospective customers – you. They will try to be nice and offer to find you seats, but most of the time it will be somewhere near their stalls so that you’d buy from them after being seated. Just be firm, the hawker centre IS A FREE SEATING FOOD PLACE like all other food centers around Singapore. You’re free to sit where you want to sit, and eat from whichever stalls you’d want to order from. Don’t feel pressured; just tell the people nicely that you do not need their help.If you’re unsure (because all menus look the same, and every other stalls sell the same barbeque seafood lookalikes), look out for this A1 logo at the A1 Seafood near the carpark entrance. I’m a regular at this stall, and I can guarantee you that the lady boss is one of the most honest stall owners that I’ve seen around. Just look out for this lady with big brown hair and a huge smile. Everything on the menu is priced at standard fixed prices, so fret not (maybe except Crabs that’s by-the-kilogram and prawns are slightly pricier – only because these types of seafood are naturally expensive to begin with). The quality of the food is also consistent and tasty. I especially recommend the Seafood Fried Rice, the Sambal Stingray (Stingray with Chilli), Sambal Kangkong, Sambal Sotong (Squid), and the Chilli Clams. Also, do order their Garlic King Prawns if you have a bigger budget for dinner. If you’re not a huge fan of spiciness, you can always ask the lady boss to recommend you some of the stall’s specialties and she’ll find what’s best for you.If I cannot convince you any further, let my images do its job. But whatever the case, A1 is probably one of the more patronized stalls there (she’s been in this business since before Newton hawker was being renovated, and she has a lot of regulars who patronize her stall all the time.) Although the stall is not registered as a stall providing Halal food, many Muslims still patronize the stall as she uses vegetable oil instead of lard (it’s also a much healthier choice).Other highly recommended stalls are (taking reference from A1 Seafood):- Oyster Omelet (Orh Lua) that’s at the 6 o’clock direction if you’re facing A1, stall 73 – I usually order the $5 “Orh Lua”.- WHITE fried carrot cake from Heng Carrot cake, along the stretch that A1 Seafood is on.- Satay and Popiah that’s at the stretch behind A1 seafood, facing the Carpark (both are at the same stall, and it’s the ONLY stall that sells both Satay and Popiah together)IF you cannot find any of the stalls and want to know which stall is best, just feel free to ask the stall owners at A1. They know which are the best stalls there.Preference for food differs from person to person, but I have frequent gatherings with various groups of friends at Newton Hawker Centre and most of them like the things that I order most of the time, so I have strong confidence that my recommendations are at least of an “above average” standard."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Authentic Local Food,1,40,3-Jul-12,"Great place to experience local cusine is in the hawker centre. Very wide variety of good food to pick from. Just ensure that you ask for the prices of the seafood before ordering, in case you're over-charged."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food at very good prices,1,50,17-Jun-12,The food is great. True Singapore / Asian style hawker food. Although there are many hawker style food places in Singapore. Newton takes the Crown...
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",This is a must try.,1,40,16-Jun-12,"My husband and I went to Newton Hawker Centre last Sunday for lunch, and were recommended by this Chinese stall to try their Rojak. Do not be mistaken, this is not the Indian one, but the Chinese style. The Chinese one is quite unique, with pineapple, pear, and you tiao. The portion is quite big too. :)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Excellent value for money,1,50,12-Jun-12,"massive choice of food, we ate here twice and would highly recommend."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",An Experience (Good),1,40,31-May-12,We found out it is a night center so there was a few hawkers open for a late lunch. The Indian food was very tasting. Visited with the guys working the stand and a random old guy that saw we were tourists. Fun experience and some good food. I was warned later to only purchase food that the price is clearly marked. Some Hawkers were price gouging people. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good food all day,1,40,28-May-12,"Only a few stalls are open in the morning, but enough variety."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great food - once you get over the hawkers,1,40,21-May-12,"The very aggressive hawkers turned me off at first. But we learned that if you just wave them away (and don't make eye contact (difficult for a friendly country girl)) - they do leave you alone and let you make your choices. You sit at a table near the middle (remember your table number or leave someone there to wave at the hawker so they'll know where to deliver the food). I prefer to order AT each stand - to ensure I know the correct price. We went back a second night - because it was so convenient to where we were staying - and the food was really good, and we had no difficulty at all. The Black Carrot Cake is delicious (warning to the novice: no carrots; not cake). And I love the pointy chicken wings: I'm going to make them that way at home from now on. It was great watching the plates that the locals had delivered. Next time maybe we'll be more courageous."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Still as good as ever....,1,50,12-May-12,"Haven't been to Newton Circus for roughly 10 years and although they have done it up, all for the good, it was still sensational. The food and service were exceptional, thorougly enjoyable and we will always come back to NC....."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Happening Newton :)),1,40,7-May-12,"conveniently located near newton mrt . 3 mins to orchard road.
U can enjoy all local food here. Is a must come place for tourists.
Enjoy our satay, bbq sting ray , fried kway teow, Hokkien prawn noodles etc etc :))"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Ikan Bakar, seafood and drink",1,40,5-May-12,I like the open air atmosphere for group meeting with my friends for food and drink.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good easy food,1,40,4-May-12,Found a stall on the outside as inside it was too noisy. Got on well with the stall holder who returned the favour every time we visited. Food was good and relatively reasonably priced. Beer price was the same as it was 10 years ago.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant hawker food court,1,50,24-Apr-12,"A great experience and amazing food - too much choice. Catch the 196 bus to Newton Circle/Circus and have a feast - cold beer, cheap food, great choice and a lot of fun. A touch of ""old Singapore"", hawker-style."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Food and great service,1,50,20-Apr-12,This was the best food and atmosphere we experienced for food in Singapore. The quality and price of the street food with the comfort of a restaurant
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","2 separate visits within a week, both great",1,50,17-Apr-12,"There are lots of negative reviews on TA regarding this place with most seemingly written by Singaporeans. I guess it's the same as most cities - the locals have their favourites that may be off the beaten track and tend to avoid touristy places - we do the same at home in Perth.That said, we ate at Newton twice in a week and both times went to shop #46. Mr Liang looked after us both times.On both occasions we had 1kg black pepper crab, 1kg chilli crab, buns, fried rice (1 x chicken + 1 x seafood) plus a small serving of half-cooked cockles. The price on both occasions was a bit over SGD$80 for the food plus another SGD$18 for drinks. Maybe that is a lot for Singaporeans but for us, from Australia, we thought it good value for the excellent products we received.We can offer no recommendations for anywhere other than shop #46 (and the drinks shop next door, #45??) but we have no hesitation in recommending shop #46. Ask for Mr. Liang and say that we sent you!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, reasonable prices, wide variety :-)",1,50,16-Apr-12,"If you like to try lots of dishes and south east asian cuisines, then Newton is the place to go. It's very clean with really tasty food but it's not air-conditioned. If you want authenticity at a really reasonably price, then Newton will tick all the boxes. Just bring a big appetite :-)"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Mmmm come here hungry,1,40,11-Apr-12,"I love the way you can walk around all the stalls, browse the menus and then order little tidbits from each vendor which comes delivered to your open air table. On a lovely breezy evening, you can sip a fruit cocktail or cold beer and snack on giant grilled prawns, fantastic noodles, char grilled fish aNd loads of satays. Value, quality and great old world atmosphere..real Singapore "
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",GREAT FOOD!,1,50,25-Mar-12,The food there is really good and I love it. Their sauce is very full of flavour and it really makes the food look more appetising as well. I like the dessert best!
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Classic hawker food,1,50,21-Mar-12,"Great all-round hawker food experience. Food is good and reasonably priced (though make sure you check prices in advance with the vendors!)
Great dish to try is the chilli stingray available at most of the seafood vendors."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Pricey but brilliant atmosphere,1,40,20-Mar-12,"A little more expensive than other hawker centres, but well worth it for the atmosphere. Seafood dishes can be very expensive."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","excellent, especially Indian Palace!",1,50,19-Mar-12,"best hawker centre in Singapore. Murtabak from the north indian stall and a lot fo good seafood stalls are highlights. special mention also for bangkok express too. by far and away the best stall is the Indian Palace though. this stall is manned by a charming family who seem to have limitless smiles and excellent service. Their curry is simply brilliant and easily on a par if not better with michelin starred curry houses I have visited in London. this guy really deserves all the praise he gets. We're repeat customers and currently working our way down the menu. inexpensive and consistently delicious, it's the best place i've eaten at in Singapore. top notch!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Big selection of food; bring Singapore cash,1,40,18-Mar-12,"Huge selection of food, you will find what you want. I want to echo and earlier reviewer who stated to look where the locals are lining up to find the best food.  Can get a good plate of food for around $3 - $4, not counting your drink(s), which generally will have to be purchased at a separate shop within the center. Also purchased a fresh fruit smoothie at a shop for around $2.Note to US travelers: They don't want US currency or credit card; walk across the street and pull out $20 Singapore from the ATM and you should be good. Those staying for a period of time in Singapore might find this advice silly, but those on layovers sometimes overlook it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Great Hawker Food,1,50,15-Mar-12,"So many great foods all crammed into one exciting area only 1 MRT stop from Orchard Road! Chilli Crab, Fried Carrot Cake and Chicken Wings are just some of the great food you will find in this multi cultural arena."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",can be fun,1,40,14-Mar-12,Can be fun even if some of the soul in the food has departed after the last renovation a few years back. Still fun eating under the stars... and ignore the touts if you can.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",We could've eaten here all day,1,40,11-Mar-12,"Newton Circus is a great hawker's center. The perfect place to venture forth into the world of Hawker food...lot's of choices, clean, accessible by the train very easily. Here is a link to my blog on our meal there - http://theadventuresofmisspiggy.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/hawker-centers-singapore.html"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good location, variety, SUGAR CANE",1,50,27-Feb-12,I always go there for the sugar cane juice! A lot of things are closed at lunch time but at night it is bustling.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lunch, dinner, late night",1,40,22-Feb-12,"Always good food during the entire day. Fun thing of these places is, that if they do not have good food, they go out of business in several weeks, they have to keep up with the quality of competition which is huge at newton hawker center. It's a clean hawker center as well, like this one"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Lively, noisy, fun - and terrific food",1,50,19-Feb-12,"Singapore's hawker centres are one of the city's joys; great food at very cheap prices. Newton is well-established, with plenty of choice: chilli Crab, black pepper crab (even better than chilli crab!) and Tiger prawns. The place may look chaotic but it's not: grab a table (and remember its number), then cruise past the various stalls and choose your dinner; it will be delivered to your table swiftly. A really great way to enjoy the local food, with plenty of atmosphere."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Well worth a visit for the experience,1,40,29-Jan-12,"While some comments state this isn’t the best hawker centre in Singapore, we still had a thoroughly enjoyable mealThe downside to the huge choice of stands is that you cannot pass, pause or even look at them without being targeted by their owner. Each outlet is obviously keen to get you to eat at their own establishment. A polite ‘just looking’ does the trick, but only until you venture three steps to the next stall!Eventually we gave up and selected stall No 78, after the owner Margaret went to great pains to explain the menu and process.All the stalls seem to push fish, probably due to it being more expensive. We were given laminated menus with pictures of the food and prices clearly displayed. Most of the dishes came in four sizes, in general small, medium, large and extra large,We ordered a medium fried rice (plenty of prawns in it), a small lemon chicken and a small fried dumpling plate. The latter contained ten decent sized prawn filled dumplings. The three dishes provided more than enough food for two to share.Drinks are ordered separately from vendors that only deal in drinks. You do not need to leave your seat to order – the vendor will find you. All food and drink is paid for at the end of the meal. Cost for the three dishes and a large tiger beer (approx 650ml) was SGD36. Well worth the trouble of a visit"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","good atmosphere, good food",1,40,18-Jan-12,Delicious hawker food and a great atmosphere - well worth the trip
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",If you're tired of the regular restaurants...,1,40,14-Jan-12,"... Newton Hawker Centre is the place to visit, to walk around, have a look, chose, sit down under the open sky without any aircon & enjoy simple but tasty food.The food was okay, not of the quality as JUMBO seafood east cost, but okay. & the atmosphere is unique, especially when all the year you've to eat in 5* hotels, posh restaurants.Another bonus: it's open very late.We loved it!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Great food, great atmosphere, great fun!!",1,50,13-Jan-12,"We went to this place twice a couple of weeks back. Saturday night is great fun with lots of people getting down for a feed. You can get cheap eats as well as tasty (but more expensive) seafood. Just for people watching alone its worth a visit.We walked around on the first night and were stopped by one lady who was probably one of the best saleswomen I've ever come across! She got her cook to whip up some awesome chilli crab and veggies.It wasn't super cheap but it was super tasty. The second time we went back we ended up going to her again and she looked after us really well, cooking up some thai style sea bass.I dont know her name or stall number but if you approach from newton MRT station you cross over the pedestrian bridge to get to newton hawker centre, when you enter via the bridge, turn right and walk up beside the stalls, after about 15-20 stalls you'll probably get stopped by this woman. She's great!Happy eating!!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Take care in ordering and enjoy,1,40,13-Jan-12,"This place is now a bit of a tourist trap - but you can still get good, cheap food if you are careful. If you are going to order any seafood - make sure you know how much they propose to charge upfront. The fried kuay teow is always good value and delicious, as is the chilli stingray. Wash it down with some chilled tiger beer and you have a perfect late night meal."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",a cultural experience,1,50,31-Dec-11,"We went there with local people, and, although they claim the area is touristic, I could find it quite singaporean.... Loved it! Lovely food and really cheap. Try the crabs...."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good but overpriced,1,40,24-Dec-11,"Newton Hawker Center is probably the most well known Hawker Center in Singapore (at least by the tourists). There are an excellent variety of foods at Newton and the quality is very good. I however would recommend other places such as Glutton's Bay near the Esplanade, or Lau Pa Sat for the scenery and location. If you are near then by all means go but it does not warrent a special trip."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Fantastic indian food,1,50,3-Dec-11,We went here twice because of the excellent indian food. Fast service. Try also the desserts. Hawker Centre easy to reach by metro from everywhere.
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Cheap but great,1,50,28-Nov-11,"The only places to eat and enjoy true local cuisine are the hawker centres, my first choice every time"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",V Good Food,1,40,2-Nov-11,It's a little like walking through the post tourist attraction gauntlet but the food is quite good. The section we sat at would grab food from a few different vendors so it worked well. Worth the trip over. Just a short walk from the Newton Metro station. 
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Night might be different,1,40,17-Oct-11,"I was there during lunch hours, and quite a few of the vendors were closed. I ordered a BBQ stingray and it was pretty good. It was about 12SGD. The place was clean and nice but hopefully a night experience would have been better."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good variety of food,1,40,14-Sep-11,"Located just off Orchard Road, Newton Hawker Centre is an easy stop for tourists wanting to experience eating outdoors, hawker centre style. The likes of sambal sting-ray, satay, sugarcane juice, mee goreng etc are available albeit at somewhat higher prices. As you approach the hawker centre, many of the stall owners will approach you to ask you to order food from them. You are not obliged to sit down directly. Take your time and have a look around. Look at the dishes on the tables of those who are already eating at the stalls. That should give you an idea of what's good or not and the portion sizes."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Delicious hawker foods at good prices and location!,1,40,23-May-11,"Although some locals do not recommend this hawker centre because it's touristy or a little bit more pricey than other hawker centres, I really like Newton Hawker Centre!Newtown Hawker Centre has a great variety of delicious local foods at cheap prices and it opens until very late. Because I always stay around Newton/Novena area whilst in Singapore, this place is handy for me. Especially sometimes I only stopover in Singapore for 1-2 days only and I always come by here and then I'd check out Mustafa 24 hour shopping centre afterwards since it's quite close.Do not worry about the vendors wanting you to buy foods at their stalls, and take your time looking around at places you fancy. Also, do not be fooled by the stall's owners. Once, my partner was tricked into buying this jumbo prawns (they're really huge because they're bigger that your computer mouse!) and they're really expensive and not worth it. Also, remember to look for A-grade stalls (they will have big A. B, C rated) for the cleanest stalls."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","Watch out for touts, avoid the seafood!",1,40,19-May-11,"This place is usually highly recommended on books and guides, however, as a local, I'd strongly advise tourists from having seafood at the stalls in this hawker centre. Better seafood at much better value can be found at other hawker centers around Singapore. However, newton hawker centre indeed serves well as a late night, supper place full of local cuisine that is of decent quality. Try the duck noodles, Cheng tng stalls over at the row of stalls facing the car park."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",will visit again,1,40,19-May-11,"I'm somekind of hard to pleased, but I find this restaurant a really good one. Its food was good. My family liked it very much. Its staff were friendly and well-trained also. They're politeness. There is one thing I adjust is that, the restaurant should improve its facilities to create a warmer atmosphere, so that guests could enjoy the food in better backdrop."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Awesome as ever,1,50,29-Apr-11,"This is the first time I have returned to Newton since it's renovation a few years back. I have to say I like it still. The food choices are great and I really enjoyed the cha kue teow, bbq chicken wings, oyster omelet, po piah, kang kong belachan and roast duck...and tiger prawns grilled with garlic.The only thing I didn't really care for is that the vendors kept chasing me as I look like an angmoh (even though i grew up in KL and Sing) and am Eurasian. They left my relatives alone as they looked more local I suppose. No big deal though."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Good for family,1,40,19-Apr-11,"The prices at Newton are several times higher than at neighborhood hawker centers. Nevertheless our family enjoys coming here, the kids like it. Usually a boisterous, friendly environment. Several can't-lose dishes such as pepper beef and chicken rice that the kids vacuum up. We always get lime juice to drink from one of the many drink vendors. The kids also like to practice with chop sticks. Although Newton is priced for tourists, the majority of the customers seem to be locals."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",FANTASTIC FOOD (We are brits who live round the corner from it and go all the time),1,50,3-Apr-11,"This serves consistently tasty and very fresh seafood. Stingray, pepper crab and kang kong (green veg) are our must haves every time we come. Great value for money. Pick your own crab to get the size you want. You must try the laksa sold by the first hawker on the right as you go in the main entrance. The place is filled with locals every night. Plus a few expats like us."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Far better than I'd anticipated,1,40,20-Mar-11,"I had heard this was a bit of a tourist trap, but was favourably impressed. If the tourists like it, it's for good reason, as the food is really, really good and really, really cheap. We were the only westerners the afternoon we went though. The centre is nice to look at, a large wooden structure surrounded by greenery. It's arranged in a circular pattern of food stalls, very clean, with outdoor seating areas under overhead ceiling fans. The food is spicy and delicious. Do go and try it."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Brilliant place,1,50,28-Sep-10,"I have been to Singapore about 5 times and always make a point of going here and I also recommend it to friends/collegues that are visiting.I have a soft spot for this place as I went to uni in Singapore for 6 months about 14 years ago. The old Newton Circus hawker centre was bonkers. Lively atmosphere and less than impressive toilet facilities but the food was cheap and plentiful and the beer was also cheap and icy cold. All you could ask for as a student. Now I am all grown up, I made a poin of going to the new Newton hawker centre as I had read the old centre has been knocked down and moved accross the road. It is all nice and a lot cleaner, no smoking and its covered so it doesnt matter if it is raining. The toilets are a million percent better. But the food and the beer are exactly the same. Great. Dont be put off my anyone trying to make you sit at their stall. Just walk around till you see something you like and order it.We always go around stall 46 as we made friends with a guy calle Po who will do anything for you. He sits you down and you dont have to worry about anything. You order everything from him and he goes to the different stalls to arrange everything for you. You just pay the different people when they come. Satays are 0.50 singapore cents each which is 25p in UK money or 2.50HKD. Po's stall does the best stingray with a spicy and tasty sauce. The stall next to his does cheap and ice cold bottles of tige beer. Its simply great and ideal for couples, large groups of friends or families. I wish there were places like this in Hong Kong. This place makes me want to live in Singapore. Open from 4pm til 4am. Easy to get to on the MRT."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",awesome nightout!,1,40,7-Aug-10,"We walked there from where we staying. We stayed around orchard road. It was about 15-20 mins walk. We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab! Crabs are about SG$3.50 per 100g at this place. There are about 50 stalls open at that time making it very hard to choose which stall you want your food from. The service was excellent from Pirate Seafood Stall! The guy Jason served us..he was excellent! I also tried the sambal pari/stingray.. it was nice! At 12am midnight, the place is still rocking..lots of crowds..awesome night out!"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Newton has changed slightly,1,40,5-Jul-10,"I just came back from Singapore again on a work trip, as usual the local colleagues brought me to Newton Food Centre on my final night there. I dreaded it a little because in previous visits, I always get swarmed by hawkers who are all selling the same dishes, BBQ Seafood, and then some.This time, things have changed. Shops between No. 56-66 give you a less stressful dining experience there. The drinks store owner told me the current talking point is this store No. 64 that sells nasi lemak, or coconut milk rice, a local favourite for breakfast lunch dinner and supper. Turns out, the owner is a fine young lad who's a Masters' holder, used to be a GM of some MNC and drived a Merc SLK Convertible. Gave it all up to follow his hobby and passion.I do not know about you, but to give up an SLK Convertible, damn this guy is insane. Well, the nasi lemak i had was very pleasant. It was rather light, and had many interesting dishes to go with the rice, curry chicken, curry pork, and some peranakan dishes as well. It was a fulfilling meal together with the other favourites like fried prawn noodles and carrot cake. I have to say, if you do visit singapore and go to newton, do visit the row of shops i mentioned, No. 56-66. Very enjoyable, and you get a fine young lad serving you nasi lemak, THAT was the highlight of my recent trip, to Singapore, and to Newton Food Centre"
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",Hidden Gem - Malay Coconut Rice & Curries,1,40,6-Jun-10,"I was in Singapore for a week with my wife and we went to Newton Food Centre near our hotel. I had previously read up about the types of food there and noticed most of the stalls served very similar foods - BBQ seafood, oyster omelette, carrot cake... For a first timer we sampled some of this and it was very good. A few nights later, a local friend took us there again for dinner and this time amidst all the BBQ seafood stalls, we had the pleasure of trying some truly splendid and different food that was not aimed at the tourist community. Our friend recommended that we try the food at this stall Curry Nasi Lemak (No. 64), a traditional malay coconut rice and assorted curries and fried foods. And we were really taken by surprise by the flavours. If you are ok for spicy foods, give this stall a try. We had curry chicken which was awesome, a dried beef curry, spring rolls, and a really fantastic honey sesame chicken which isn't always available (as told by the stall owner). You can request for it, and they'll whip up a hot fresh portion for you. Coated with a black honey sauce and toasted sesame seeds on top, about US$1 per piece. I'm from the States and the asian restaurants don't come close to the flavours and spices used here. Prices are a fraction of what you would pay at the BBQ stalls, a dish costing about US$2 each versus US$30-US$50 at the BBQ stalls. Give it a try if you are looking for something different and authentic flavours, and not targeted at tourists. Mostly local people eat there.Beware though, their homemade chilli sauce is amazingly spicy... but full of flavour. Hope you find this review useful."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore","GIve it a go and wear your loosest, lightest clothes-there is no breeze.",1,40,23-Dec-09,"I went last night with boyfriend, we recently moved to Singapore and heard this was a different type of Hawker Centre. It is, it's recently been refurbished so lots of flashing lights and definitely aimed towards tourists. But, if you've only been here a week, (as we have) and have struggled a few times to get what you're after in the very local Hawkers, Newton is a good place to start.Don't be put off by the way the owners try to engage in conversation and get you to check out their menus. It is a bit forceful but, once you take a seat, you can decide what you fancy, every style of food is available, BBQ, lots of fresh Seafood, etc. It can get busy so if you see a good table, grab it.We started by letting this guy show us his menu and asked him what was good, i fancied a Laksa so he fetched me one with cockels, i'd never heard of this type before but it was delicious, shame they used Spaghetti which they seem to do here quite a bit....give me Udon noodles!!Then, he fetched us some Swordfish, warned us that it was spicy, maybe too spicy...we love spicy, it wasn't spicy. I was told, if you ask for a dish 'home style' they will make it with the heat which ordinarilly they'd remove for tourists.We also had a selection of satay sticks and about 4 little cans of Tiger beer each, all for less than $50. The lady selling us the beer actually brought us over a couple of free ones before we left and both she and the guy we initially spoke to made a point of coming over to say goodbye when we were leaving, very sweet and friendly. I would recommend it to anyone."
Indian,"Newton Hawker Centre, Singapore",fav restaurnt in singapore,1,40,13-Nov-08,"Singapore is famous for its hawker centres, and if you want to go to the city's most famous one then visit this one. It's a bit out of the city centre, which is a bit of a pain (there's a subway station nearby though), but food is cheap and plentiful."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,friendly service crew. delicious duck.,1,50,5/3/2018,Surprised that they have newly opened at Raffles City Basement. The basement is so overwhelmed with food / restaurants that it is easy to overlook these place. Service is consistently good but lighting is extremely dim and ambience is no where as welcoming as Scotts Square. I was there on a weekend and place was almost deserted.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious succulent roast duck!,1,40,04/23/18,"This is the place to come for roast duck! Order your dishes by filling in the menu form and the staff will do the rest!

Chinese,London Fat Duck,Early Dinner!,1,40,11/10/2017,"Heard about this restaurant from my daughter. So I had to really give it a try. Although it did not disappoint, it had not left an impression that I need to go back. Decent food. Had the trio-combo bbq combination. It was good enough and the vegetable was also good.Over-all, there is this chinese bbq restaurant over at bugis which has a better duck and char siu IMHO."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch,1,40,10/3/2017,"Irish fattened ducks are roasted on site , hence fresh and moist.sweetened Roast pork also features. Rice or noodles and fried vegetables are good too. Prices are reasonable."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Yummy !!!,1,50,09/27/17,"Ate at the London Fat Duck, our meal was amazing !! Was also very reasonable in price compared to similar restaurants nearby. Would recommend !!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Sure is fat and juicy,1,40,09/14/17,"They live up to their Name. The duck meat is sure fat, juicy and tender. It might not be the best roasted duck ever but it is satisfying enough. Their other dishes are good too, like the roast pork, char siew which is on the fatter side which makes it softer. Service is quick and friendly too."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great porridge,1,50,07/22/17,"Whatever we ordered, everything taste delicious. When skimming the menu outside the door, we were intriqued with pig ear terrine. So we gave it a try and it does not disappoint. However, we ended up ordering two porridges, roasted pork, bbq pork, roasted duck, and radish cake. Ohhh so good. Will come back to taste the pig's ear terrine."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner,1,50,07/19/17,First time to this outlet but was not a stranger as have visited the other outleta on several occassions. Food did not disappointed me as the quality and taste was exactly the same with the other outlet.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,yummy to the max,1,50,7/7/2017,yummy as always.. nothing can beat the crunchiness and tender of fried duck here.. however they dont provide tissue as they will charge for wet tissue. so pls prepare to bring one.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice spin on roast duck : Dim Sum ,1,40,7/4/2017,Chanced on this in the basement of the high end mall after deciding $26 is too much to pay for a hot dog no matter how hipster the coffee shop is ! As a 'ang mo' local slang for a white guy I'm not an expert on dim sim & roast but you can taste the difference between here and equivalent or even more expensive places. London refers to the imported duck they use and it's a singapore restaurant rather than a franchise of a Hong Kong chain like some others.Overall well worth a try I recommend the pepper duck bau and the roast pork :)
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Food court setting, oustanding duck and pork, peculiar service",1,40,06/28/17,"The place feels like a mall food court setup. The duck is delicious, the bbq pork belly is crunchy and taste great. Try the pressed pig year (appetizer, cold cut). It looks great sliced and tastes better than it looks.If you have a healthy appetite don't bother with anything less than half duck. It's not as big as it sounds.I was a bit disappointed with the duck tongue appetizer. It comes with the jaw bone attached.I understand this is an Asian restaurant but I thing they could use a few wines on the menu.Service is strange: different wait stuff stops by every once in a while, checks your order (which stays on the table), go away. One of the waitresses did that, then walked two tables away and stared at me while I was eating. I guess she was getting bored, it was late, place was almost empty."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food is good - service and decor average,1,40,6/12/2017,Don't get confused with Hestons London fat duck - the food was good and obviously popular with locals when you see the long queue for takeaway. The decor is tired and a bit scruffy bu the food was good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Nice food, service so-so",1,40,6/6/2017,"We were browsing and wanted to try this place as i wanted to try their roast items. Ordered the three combination, noodles and also some dim sum to try. The combination turn out very well especially the char siew as it had a mix of lean + fat meat on every piece(which is the way i liked my char siew). The black pepper duck bun was also tasty though the downside is that there is little filling (pic attached). The signature steam cheong fun was also good and inside the fritter, there was some prawn/fish paste which gave that food a different texture and taste. They kept the sauce and cheong fun separate instead of pouring the sauce on the cheongfun. Service is somewhat lacking and the staff mixed up our table orders with another's even though it was not full. The place is also pretty simple and felt similar to a crystal jade. Overall, i would probably want to try some of the other dishes to see if this could become a regular hangout."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Quite okay,1,40,6/5/2017,"We tried the duck wanton noddle, black pepper bun, quarter duck, charsiew and other dimsum items. All was averagely okay, except for the YUMMY honey charsiew. The duck itself and black pepper bun was quite underwhelming but still nice nonetheless. Not a must return but still an option."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,It's a Hong Kong Style Cuisine,1,40,05/28/17,"I was confused when I saw the signage. I was remembered of Heston's Fat Duck in London. In fact it's a Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong style. It has plenty menu, and I thinks it's quite alright."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty and tender,1,40,04/22/17,"Had dinner at the vivocity outlet. The duck with salted vegetable soup could have been subtler. Not that it wasn't tasty, but could have held back in the salt a little. Duck noodles was good- tender, succulent duck slices with springy noodles and blanched veges. Service was also not bad given that they were extremely busy during dinner time."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck was lovely,1,50,4/5/2017,The duck we ordered was perfect. Better tasting than the Peking duck. The staff was very attentive to us. We asked for additional condiments..it was brought to.ia in no time.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Must try 3 meat combination !,1,50,4/5/2017,"We were back there again at their outlet in Vivocity, this time for lunch. My friend was there ahead, so she took a table for 3 of us.Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for a weekday lunch. Service is as usual good and efficient.She has never tried it here, so we ordered our usual favorites, a quarter roast duck and some dim sum. She also wanted to try the other 2 meats, roast pork and char siew. Wow ! The char siew was moist, tender, succulent and tasty ! The roast pork too, n not too saltish ! She also agreed with our verdict of the London Fat roast duck : a ravishing delight.She even brought home the meats, which we couldn't finish. Her parents liked them so much, and said...Not enough for them. LOL.Will be back, to satisfy our craving for roast meats !"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lip smacking stuff,1,50,03/22/17,"Fatty Char siew. Roast duck. Charcoal buns with peppery duck fillings. I am just going to recommend dishes to try because the food served at this restaurant is nothing short of amazing, my words would not do it sufficient justice. Your taste buds would thank me for it, I kid you not!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tasty duck,1,40,2/12/2017,My first visit has left a satisfying impression although the portion of duck served included a fair amount of boney bits. The meaty bits served did taste as good as the famous roast duck restaurant in Bayswater London. A side order of the water cress soup with pork ribs was decidedly flavoursome and the meat well cooked. I will return when I next fancy a London roast duck dinner!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Excellent roast duck,1,50,01/29/17,Excellent roast duck. That's what this restaurant is famous for. Located at the basement of the Scott Square.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Why not Fat Duck ?,1,50,01/22/17,"We were wondering why it's called Fat Duck, anyway we went to try it.We tried it at their outlet in Vivo City, basement 2. It was Fri evening, we were there slightly after 6 pm, and lucky to have seats right away.We ordered a quarter roast duck, har kao, siew mai and fu pi quan, and 2 porridge for 4 of us.The duck didn't disappoint, neither did the dim sum, which is by far the best we've tasted in a very long time here in Singapore. The price of the dim sum is the usual restaurant price, so it's really good."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lunch ,1,40,01/17/17,Famous for its roast duck which comes from Ireland. Rather fat duck but you could easily separate the fat from the meat. Reasonably priced. Good range of other dishes typically Cantonese style food
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Duck is good.,1,50,12/22/16,My table ordered half a duck. It was quite sizable. The roast duck is good. The gravy they pour on it the duck plus the plum sauce were delicious. I like duck and this ranks quite high up on my roast duck list. It is a bit on the fat side. The fat is very adherent to the meat and less so to the skin.The liver porridge was so-so. The pork cheong fun was good.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good fatty duck,1,40,12/16/16,The concept of this restaurant is just like the typical Hong Kong style roasted cuisine. They import their ducks and these ducks are fat. Love the skin of these roasted ducks. They serve good roasted port and char siew too!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Surprised ,1,40,12/10/2016,"We went there at 330pm so there wasnt any queue. Ordered half a duck, it was excellent not dry just like how they do it in Beijing. Excellent duck"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,No queue,1,40,10/28/16,Went in on a rainy Friday evening for dinner with my lucky self.Had the duck noodles and the crispy pork. The duck noodles were good. Not a big portion but enough to taste duck and noodles together in one plate. The soup was rather peppery but the duck was tender with some bones to challenge. Noodles were well done. Not too soft yet springy and with good texture. Crispy pork serving was a bit small but all good in taste and the skin was crispy and wafer thin. Best was the chilli dip. Shiok. Not sure why mustard was served with crispy pork. Bad combo.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Family lunch,1,40,10/20/16,Good spot to stop for lunch while shopping on Orchard Rd. Food and service good and reasonably priced.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delightful duck!,1,40,09/25/16,"The duck here is delightful and you can have it with rice, noodles and congee. The char siew (pork belly) is a wee bit fatty, but the crackling roasted pork was pretty good.While the dim sum and other items on the menu were tasty too, the key draw here should be the duck!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Smooth Duck Specialty,1,40,9/6/2016,"Specialized in roasted duck. The rice is normal while the noodle is specially thin that can either flow through or stuck in the gaps between the teeth. The duck is smooth and soft and the skin roasted to perfect crispy texture.The signature side dishes include London duck buns with pepper or original flavour, crispy shrimp dumplings and steamed cheong fun. My personal pick is the pepper London duck bun coated with black pepper adding spicy flavour to the outer bun which upon ""bitten"" ""secreted"" juicy sauce enclosing small bits of duck meat."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice duck n roasted meat,1,40,08/20/16,"We went to the new outlet at Vivo City. The duck has very nice and crispy skin, meat was juicy and the sauces nice. The roasted meat - especially 'char Siew' is nice.Other dim sum not bad. Taste like most HK cruisine prepared by HK chefs. Place was crowded. Book early or queue early. Pro.icing reasonable. Sitting capacity limited."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Love the Fat Ducks!,1,40,8/5/2016,"Service was just passable. But soon forgotten with the really lovely duck and roast meats.
Recommend to go after 3pm to avoid the crowd and have faster service.
Do also order their carrot cakes!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Nice duck & dim sum,1,40,8/4/2016,"Went there for lunch with my in-laws and family. Ordered the duck dish, char siew, roasted, pandan snow custard bun and signature black pepper London Duck bun. The char siew was made from more fatty meat and tasted a little spongy. The duck, pandan snow bun and roasted pork were nice. However we found the black pepper London duck bun was too spicy and peppery. Perhaps should have tried the London Duck Snow bun."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good only if you order whole duck,1,40,8/3/2016,"Make sure to 'order only' the whole duck so you can be sure of the parts given.I came here once for a single portion meal accompanied with noodle, and I was given a few pathetic pieces of boney-parts with hardly any meat. I was so disappointed. It gives me the impression that they're serving left-over parts taken from 'whole' duck orders from others "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great lunch ,1,40,7/12/2016,Overall great char Siew and roasted pork belly and roast duck which is more meaty and have more favours. Truly enjoy my lunch here. Prices are rather friendly. Perhaps was there just before noon and place does gets pack up rather fast.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Uberly tasty roast duck at a very reasonable price!,1,50,06/28/16,"One of my cheaper eats in Singapore and amazingly good. The roast duck was tender and juicy, while the skin was crisp, the crispy pork was perfect and the char sui was out of this world."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Gathering with Friends,1,40,06/16/16,"Had dinner with my friends at London Fat Duck, located at Scotts Square basement tonight. Nearest MRT will be Orchard station.It's the few restaurants that still serves dim sum all day. Nice roast duck, roast pork and smooth porridge. Restaurant has about 40-50 seating, with 2 big tables good for 8 persons each. Polite waiters and waitresses served promptly.Enjoyed. Tasty food at above average prices."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, delivered Fast!",1,50,05/31/16,"Had lunch with 4 other colleagues, good and value for money tim sum. Great Roast Duck, its really fat.. juicy and flavourful. The Hong Kong style noodles were good too. Mixed review of the Roast Char Siew as well as the signature Pandan liu sha Bao.. I love them both but not my colleagues.The crab porridge was good :)Total damage $131 for 5 persons, I think its really affordable, bearing in mind the amount of food we ate.We were seated at a corner, and found it difficult to capture the attention of the service staff. But when served, they were friendly and assisted accordingly. Food service was really fast, and fresh! Only one gripe, throw the jumpy CD that you are using, its jumps really badly and is an ear-sore! Will definitely be back!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,One of the Best Roast Duck,1,40,05/30/16,"London Fat Duck is definitely one of the best Roast Duck restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity.
They have nice menu and most of the food are high standard"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,If you love duck,1,40,04/29/16,"Great duck place. Their roasted duck is succulent and tender. Don't forget the char siew (BBQ pork with honey sauce). A little charred on the outside, yet soft and tender inside. It is a simple place for Hong Kong style noodles and porridge."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Its all about the duck,1,40,04/16/16,"So there is some dim sum dishes but otherwise it is all about the duck. This is suppose to be the wagyu of duck air flown from Ireland - it is that good with a thick layer of fat between the skin and meat. There is very little else on the menu though, so its all about the duck!"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Heaven!,1,40,4/7/2016,"I am from the U.S. so I may not have many good experiences with real Chinese bar b q. I am in love with this place and am so glad I was able to stop by for a bite of heaven. The roast pork here was awesome. I love how the meat is marbled with fat and then a thin crispy skin, there is no thick layer of fat that I am accustomed to here in the states. Can't wait to come back."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Great food and service,1,50,03/24/16,"Managed to try out this place in HK by Gordon Ramsey.
Great food and service. Great view of harbour. Wonderful crowd and atmosphere."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Dinner at Waterway Point,1,40,03/13/16,"This restaurant is located at the newly opened Waterway Point at 83, Punggol Central #01-23.You could travelled by bus, LRT and taxi to this Mall.It serves various roasted duck dishes, Hong Kong Congee and noodles, Rice, dim sum, seasonal vegetables, desserts and beverages.Their Signature dishes are London Roast Duck, Barbecue Pork with Honey Sauce, Black Pepper London Duck Bun, Steamed Cheong Fun.The filling of this Cheong Fun is a fried spring roll with prawn. Very unique but please consume while it is hot.The Hong Kong Wanton Noodle and their Golden Custard Bun is a must try dishes.Their Buns surprised me in a way that the skin of normal buns are steamed soft; but their outlook are like biscuit form which are dry. But the buns must be consumed while hot.Those who likes duck dishes should give it a try. But the waiting time is not very encouraging. We waited for 40 mins before a table is available."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious,1,40,3/2/2016,Food was excellent... Loved the Roasted pork and duck.. moist and tasty! I ordered a Congee with pork liver and it was delicious as well. Loved the food at this restaurant! But the only reason they don't get a full 5/5 rating is because of the not so friendly staff. Even though the food they served kind of made up for it but still... service is probably the most important thing they should be upholding in a restaurant. Nonetheless... great food!
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Very tasty dishes,1,40,02/23/16,"My family and I visited the newly opened outlet at Punggol Waterway Point for dinner. We ordered the duck buns (HK ""Po lo"" style), steamed shrimp dumpling (har gao), siew mai, assorted 3 BBQ meats platter, shrimp/pork dumpling soup with noodles, vegetables with oyster sauce and signature rice rolls. The dim sum items were fresh and tasty and very similar to the good Guangzhou dim sum restaurants that I went to, but not as good as the HK ones. The rice rolls we ordered were actually deep fried spring rolls covered with a thin layer of smooth rice flour skin. Quite novel for me but not as tasty. The noodles were comparable with Canton Paradise and some HK restaurants. Shrimp/pork dumplings were very flavourful due to the fresh ingredients and had a good texture. But the best was the roast meat platter. The pork belly (sio bak) and roast duck could easily match those offered at fine dining Cantonese restaurants and the tender BBQ pork (char siew) had a rich and luxurious sauce. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Food standard till good service better,1,40,2/1/2016,"Had breakfast on 30/1/16 duck noodle, porridge some tim sum. The duck bun still good and so is the custard bun serve pipping hot yum yum, love it. For 4 pax we spend $67.00 also have some duck wing, carrot cake , chicken feet, dough fritter.Good place for tim sum."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,food standard till good,1,40,11/24/15,"brought an oversea guest there 9th nov 2015. order the famous duck, tim sum
the food standard is still good. tim sum range not very large but quality is good enough to fill the stomach."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Small little eatery in the city center with good value and quality food,1,40,11/15/15,"This restaurant used duck from Ireland, which has a nice layer of fat.After roasting, it tasted different from the local varieties.Other then the signature roast duck, which is good., the signature black pepper London duck bun is unique too.The bun had a thick layer of black pepper on it outer surface of the bun filled with duck meat. The combination gives a very interesting taste with sweet and peppery at the same time.The rest of the noodle and Tim Sum dishes are of good quality too.This is one of the few places in Singapore that serves Tim Sum after 3pm.I would return again to try the rest of the dishes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,yummy fat duck,1,40,11/14/15,"my 2nd returning visit to the restaurant.
their ducks are really nice.. the roasted pork is also another must try item to order. porridge was alright but not the noodles. service rendered would need some form of improvement. their buns are good too!snowy bun especially"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Chinese BBQ and Dim Sum Together!,1,50,11/2/2015,"Stopped in for a a take-away order. They were quick to take my order and the food was prepared in a reasonable time.I ordered BBQ pork with the Honey Sauce, Shrimp Dumplings, Radish Cakes and Crispy Shrimp Dumplings.Each dish was delicious. You do not need this many dishes for a meal as this was way more food than I needed. It was so good that I did end up eating too much though."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Really Tasty Duck..,1,40,10/28/15,"Be prepared to wait for your queue if you come during dinner timings.
Great tasting duck, very fatty. Typical Chinese restaurant type of setting, with oily floors."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Just brilliant,1,40,10/27/15,"I knew that I loved this place after my first experience and I knew that I would be returning. Four visits and I still want more. That is four visits in three weeks!. If you like efficient staff, authentic food and a taste paradise then come here. You would usually order with pen and check boxes but sometimes they bring out the iPads which is fun. My few recommendations: get the brisket noodle. It is incredible. Any of the dim sum is also wonderful. My favourite is the steamed prawns. The Hong Kong won tons are very good too. My one disappointment was the signsture fat duck dumpling. Mostly rice and little duck. Of course I have to mention the duck. Excellent but it comes with the bones. So note that. Before I go home, I will be back. Come off peak, you will be waiting at peak hours for a minimum of an hour. 4pm for lunch and 8 pm for dinner are my suggestions."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Delicious,1,40,10/18/15,"Had no idea that this restaurant might be popular but it happened to be near where we were staying so decided to try it out and enjoyed the food. Figure we should ordered the specials so stuck with the pork and the duck and the buns and they were all delicious. There was a bit of a queue at about 7pm but we were seated within about 15 minutes, service was quick and we enjoyed the buzzy atmosphere"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Best Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce,1,40,10/11/2015,Excellent taste of Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce. One of best in Singapore in addition to the Signature London Roast Duck. Queue is more than 30 mins but it is worth it. Black pepper London Duck Bun is another great choice. The duck and pork are so juicy. Better come earlier to avoid long queue.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Out of this world ,1,50,09/24/15,"If you like the roast duck to be crispy and a bit fat, then you will enjoy this. If you like your duck lean, then this is not for you. We had it for lunch together with wanton noodles which was very good too with the noodles al Dente. Had the roast pork and the famous snow bun. Only problem is they do not allow reservation so you have to go early and queue. Also not many big tables "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Super Good Crispy Bun with black pepper duck,1,40,09/22/15,"For enthusiats inChinese Dimsum this restaurant is a must when visiting Singapore. The spiciness and crispy texture of the bun really had me begging for more. I tried Siew Long Pao too and it turned out to be quite good for me. Served hot and not so overpriced making dim sum here a lovely experience in my trip this time. I went during late afternoon hours which made me getting no long queuing experience, so I would recommend the time for your visit to avoid the crowd."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Highlight of our trip,1,50,09/18/15,Now this place is amazing. The food was the best we had in Singapore. Yes you have to wait (we waited an hour) but there is a good reason for that and it's worth every second. We ordered while we waited so when we were called to a table the food was fast and ohhh so yummy. We tried a bit of everything and there was not one thing to complain about. If you are in Singapore make sure you take the time to check this little hidden gem out!Thank you London Fat Duck - you are a credit to Singapore
Chinese,London Fat Duck,duck and black pepper char siew bun,1,40,09/17/15,"waited 15 minutes at around 7pm on a weekday for my seat. the duck meat is tender and the skin crispy, the pepper charsiew bun was pipping hot. i ordered one whole duck and was only given 2 teaspoon full of plum sauce, i asked for extra plum sauce and was given another 2 teaspoon's full :( will go back again for the food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Tender duck!,1,40,09/13/15,"The waiter couldn't find our reservation and the place was full. They sat 6 of us at a table for 4, and it was a tight squeeze. They promised us the next available table but it never happened.We ordered a number of dishes and a few stood out, among which was the roast duck which was very tender and delicious. The salted egg custard buns were nice, but the bun was very thin and it broke, leaking its contents all over my hand.The roast pork was crispy and lean, but the pieces were unevenly cut, and the portion seemed very small for the price."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,YUM!,1,40,9/2/2015,"We ate both the duck and the char siew...both were amazing! Also had the black pepper buns, which are a must. Service is prompt, friendly, and courteous. We brought our own wine, corkage fee a bit steep but we wanted something great to drink with such great food."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Fatty duck,1,40,08/17/15,High in demand and patience required for a long wait to obtain a table. Roast pork & duck sell out very fast so order them when you get your queue number. Selection of vegetable dishes was poor.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Good food & Good service,1,40,08/13/15,I went to this restaurant with high hopes that the duck would resemble those I've eaten in London and it did not fail me. The duck was obviously not from our part of the world as the layer of fats was exceptionally thicker than normal. The price for a portion for 1-2 persons at $12.80 was reasonable especially if you are eating other dishes. The Shrimp dumpling soup was normalThe crispy London duck snow bun was commendable tho a tad sweet. Egg tarts were actually very good. Very Flaky pastry with excellent smooth egg filling.
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Succulent duck,1,40,8/4/2015,"Went there on a weekday for lunch. There was a long Q but well controlled. Suppose it is a novelty for Singaporeans. The wait was worth it . The duck is tasty, succulent and the noodles have a nice crunch. We also had the ""char siew"" which is more local than ""London"" . It tasted sweet and goes well with rice"
Chinese,London Fat Duck,A nice weekend brunchy kinda place,1,40,07/30/15,This place did not disappoint me. Had the duck and noodles and plenty of dim sum and polished off everything. Price is very reasonable and portions are reasonable. Good quality dim sum and the duck was very tasty. A great place for anyone who loves duck and dim sum in general. Would definitely come back for more!! 
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Pretty good,1,40,07/22/15,"Was recommended by my uncle to try this place and was pleasantly surprised. The black pepper duck bun was very good and the cha siu was original tasting. Slight complaint would be the duck...very fatty and if that's what you like, then there should be no problem. Overall a simple and good lunch experience and would definitely recommend to others."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Good Food, Inattentive Service, Expensive",1,40,07/21/15,"Had lunch recently & found the food to be good. Nice roast duck with crispy skin and a flavoursome sauce. Decent roast pork with crispy crackling and excellent char siu that was dark and glazed with charred bits that so many look for. Hong Kong style dishes that judging from the dishes we had would get my thumbs up. Nice shrimp dumpling soup & congee. A selection of dim sum available - recommend the black pepper buns which are a nice variation on the familiar ""po lor bau"".The restaurant fills up fast and doesn't take reservations. Go early to snag a table without too much of a wait. However they are forgetful and we were overlooked despite being given a queue number. No apologies but they quickly got us a table when reminded. Servers tend to be inattentive and it's hard to catch their attention; they all seemed too busy. Perhaps the best suggestion is to order take out & save all the hassle. Other people did. Would definitely come back for the food.Essentially for small portions, the bill came to S$100 including an order of custard tarts for dessert."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Pleasant place for lunch and dinner,1,40,07/14/15,"Good Hong Kong style dinning, have taken London roast duck noodle, signature black pepper bun and crispy London duck snow bun and love it."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Yummy char siew noodles,1,40,7/11/2015,"I was glad that I asked for take out with such a long wait going for those looking to eat at the restaurant. It was a small area and hence the long queue. I ordered the char siew noodles and duck noodles. Both are dry version . The take away was a genius, the sauces and chili were all provided in separate containers. by the time I got home, the noodles were still springy ,not soggy."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,For duck lovers only,1,40,7/1/2015,"The roast ducks are indeed fat like its namesake and that's exactly what it has promised to offer and that's what I am here for. It's probably one of the few restaurants in Singapore which is serving free range ducks from Ireland. It's definitely above average - duck is juicy, flavorful and fat. I also tried the black pepper duck bun, which is quite delicious. I went at 5ish on a Saturday and was seated in 15-20mins. Will revisit if i am in the neighbourhood and if I dont have to wait for too long. And at $48 per duck, it's quite reasonably priced."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Signature buns and great char siu,1,40,06/14/15,"Crowded with long queues so be prepared to wait! The most memorable dish was the signature buns - black pepper duck and crispy London duck. They are baked with a crisp outer crust, soft bread and juicy tasty filling. The barbecue pork with honey (char siu) was delectable. The Signature London roast duck was quite good though we would have preferred it deboned. Give the congee and tim sum items a miss. Have definitely tasted better. There is only one dessert, mango purée with sago and this was refreshing if somewhat average. The prices are very reasonable and service is energetic and fast. "
Chinese,London Fat Duck,"Without the fat duck, this place would be a dead duck!",1,40,06/13/15,"The only reason(s) to come here are the unique ducks (although the roast pork and the black pepper duck puffs are pretty good). The roast ducks are super yummy - fragrant, moist, tasting almost like geese. In my opinion the best roast ducks in Singapore. Otherwise, other items on the very short menu are less good than at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure (the congees and soups are noticeably bland), and there is no point in coming to the low-traffic Scotts Square mall just for this. Service management is one of the worst in the country - there is always a queue (sometimes extending to one hour!), yet tables are left empty (including some already cleaned) for up to 10 minutes."
Chinese,London Fat Duck,Lack variety but excellent for the signature duck dish,1,40,6/4/2015,"Went for the famous Signature duck. Fatty and juicy and reminds me of the roast goose in HK. Would be even better with the plum sauce but the chili paste is a good replacement. However I find the signature black pepper duck bun to be more special with the kick of black pepper spice. Make excellent alternative to Tim ho wan style bun. The wonton noodle is not bad at all, so is the char siu (glaze pork) and the roast pork belly. All in all makes a wonderful lunch. However as they are new, the operations need to be more finetune. Wrong sequence of orders, long queue at the register counter etc, but I am sure they will get this right soon."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,attached bakery,1,40,12/22/17,"so crystal jade also has a bakery arm attached to the restaurant, called ""Crystal Jade My Bread"", not very original but the breads are quite decent."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very nice soup noodle and fried rice,1,40,9/2/2017,"We're having a brunch at this Crystal Jade in Holland Village after our brisk walk morning exercises. This Crystal Jade is open from morning to serve breakfast dishes, such as hong kong styles congee and dim sum. We really like their shrimp fried rice, wantan shrimp soup noodle and a few other dim sum dishes. Ambience is pretty basic / average, with outdoor seatings. Prices are quite high though, I think little bit overpriced. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Lunch ,1,40,05/24/17,"Well regarded restaurant with excellent Cantonese and Teochew food. Roast meats, teochew braised duck, pomfret fish porridge and yam desserts are exceptional."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food. Just a little noisy,1,50,12/26/16,I've been here many times since I was a kid. And it has never changed. The Cantonese food here is decent for its price. But beware it's very noisy as people talk on top of one another. It's actually a very normal thing here. Also there are lots of kids that cry from time to time. So if you don't mind it all. Give this place a go!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dinner ,1,50,12/11/2016,Excellent Chinese cuisine with very friendly staff and very prompt service. The dishes were fantastic and great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"After all these years, still good.",1,50,11/16/16,"This is my go-to place for comfort food. Quality consistently good over the past decade. Opens till after 12mn if I'm not wrong. My usual fav are the char Siew pastries, sweet and sour pork and clay pot eggplant."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dinner,1,40,10/7/2016,"Great place for Cantonese casual dining with wide range of typical Cantonese dishes and dimsum dishes.
Prices are reasonable."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,INCREDIBLE!!!! - food that is good to the last drop,1,50,9/10/2016,"The food here was incredible - and well priced. There was not one dish that was not absolutely delicious. I couldn’t stop eating - which is rarely something that happens to me. But it was just SO GOOD. The atmosphere and service leave something to be desired. But with food that good, who cares?!? We walked in on a Thursday evening and got a table without a wait."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food!,1,40,08/27/16,We have been going to Crystal Jade regularly and we never grow tired of the food they serve. It's delicious!
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Still an enjoyable place for a weekend dim sum lunch,1,40,03/25/16,"Starting off as a single site, the Lorong Mambong branch now encompasses three separate but related establishments - two restaurants (Kitchen and La Mian Xiao Long Bao), and a bakery (My Bread). This review pertains to our recent visit to Kitchen for a extended family Sunday lunch. We've always enjoyed coming here and although there are some limited fan-cooled seats downstairs, we usually make it a point to get tables in the air-conditioned section upstairs. Reservations are taken except on Sundays, so come early...preferably before 11.30 am. Had a dim sum selection and while the standard's probably gone down somewhat over the years, it was still decent nonetheless. Service was basic but friendly, and I was accidentally splashed on my back with some ice water by the waitress but no harm done."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very good value for excellent quality Chinese,1,50,02/27/16,"Yes, of course this is one of many Chinese restaurants, and yes I know it is part of a chain of restaurants. And, for what it is, it think it is really good value and I love the food. The BBQ duck and pork options are yummy, the asparagus with mushrooms and truffle oil delicious, the salty fish rice delectable and I could go on. Don't forget to take your appetite!!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Salted egg xiao long bao & Chilli crab xiao long bao,1,50,01/27/16,"Food was good, especially Chilli Crab xiao long bao. If you do not exactly fancy spicy food, you could still give it a try.Salted egg xiao long bao was below my expectation, there were not much soup in each of the buns and the meat was kind of dry, compared to the usual xiao long baos.Ordered the La Mian with scallion and dong po rou as well and it made the trip there on a rainy day so much more bearable. It tasted heavenly! I could still remember that awesomeness 2 weeks now since I last had it.Great service, great food!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Crystal Jade @ Great World City,1,40,11/22/15,"The simple egg fried rice ranks supreme comparing with the once-renown Ding Tai Fung's @ Paragon Orchard ! Also, the vegetarian dumplings are as good as ever along with many other marvellous stir fried dishes and above all, diners are well attended to by sufficient crew... Never hesitate to have the next family lunch or dinner at this quality restaurant..."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Don't like new menu layout ,1,40,04/18/15,"It's our regular haunt every month and we've seen this place grow from start till today.Crystal Jade in Holland Village has gone through several changes over the years from changing their fresh dimsum to frozen and the latest 3rd menu change (which seems the most confusing).The food is the same good quality, albeit the menu needs some more thought. We were both turned off enough to lose a bit of appetite just making sense of it.We ordered their Braised Brinjal and Minced Pork, Deep Fried Salted Egg Prawns and Shrimp Wanton Soup.....the Salted Egg Prawns, the prawns separated too easily from the batter...... and rice wasn't too fresh tastingService slowed down due to new service staff. They need help."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Reliable Chinese restaurant,1,40,03/25/15,"Although this is a famous chain restaurant, the quality of foods is very reliable. Various dim-sum items and good environment inside the restaurant. Especially the duck foods are tasty and recommended."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Xiao Long Bao served were very nice and tasty. my daughter enjoy this as can't find any in Australia.,1,40,03/17/15,reasonable variety but some dishes price are on a high side. overall enjoy the dishes. just hope that they could have more variety cater to all the branches.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good food,1,40,11/19/14,It's a charm restaurant with good food. The food is Chinese Style but not oily and strong flavor like the normal Chinese food I tried in other restaurants. It tastes delicate.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Chineses Cuisine,1,40,7/8/2014,Try to eat at Crystal Jade Restaurant. The food are delicious and savory. The price is affordable too. Friendly and accommodating waitresses.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Love the dim sum for lunch!,1,40,04/15/14,"Everytime we visit Singapore, we make this place a must stop for lunch. We always go during the work week so have no issues with reservations or service.The dim sum is very good! Also the fish congee and duck are nice as well."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Hong Kong food affordable & tasty.,1,40,10/25/13,"The Good =)~Excellent chefs whip up great HK dishes.The Bad =(~Some dishes are meant for sharing & not for 1 pax, good to check with the waiter first.My Tip for future visits:~Try to avoid during dinner times which has a long wait."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Eating For Pleasure,1,40,9/6/2013,The restaurant is situated in the upmarket Holland Village area and serves fresh authentic Chinese food.. The lotus root preparation is delicious and presentation is excellent. Its a dish we never fail to order.The Hor Fun is also tempting and the crispy pork is a great accompaniment. The sea coconut dessert is a sweet finale. There's a chain of Crystal Jade restaurants in Singapore and we make it a point to visit at least one of them when we are in the country.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great Authentic Chinese Food,1,40,9/3/2013,"We had dinner with 4 friends. We ordered crispy pork, bbq pork, steam fish, fried kailan, duckegg battered prawns, fried rice, jelly fish. The food was awesome, pure authentic Chinese food. The service was good and the waitress was so superb that she even cover our bags with napkins so that they will not be stained in case accidentally, someone spilled the gravy on to our bags. The overall service as great. We love to dine in Crystal Jade whenever we arrive in Singapore."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,A restaurant with so much of tradition yet so different,1,40,06/24/13,"The restaurant serves mainly typical Chinese dishes but with a little extra touch in the preparation of food and reasonably good service quality, it is a pleasant place to have decent business lunch."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great Cantonese Food and Mid-day Dim Sum,1,50,04/23/13,"Fast efficient service and piping hot dishes make this a great place for a delicious Cantonese fare ""fix"" - Great for either lunch or dinner."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Nice Chinese food,1,40,04/18/13,"This has good Chinese dishes from dimsum to noodles, etc. But it is always crowded whenever we visit so prepare to queue and wait. Staff are helpful."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very popular with the locals,1,40,4/8/2013,This group of restraurant ..have a wide range of cusine ..from very down to earth to the exotic ..better check on thier website before you head out ...extremely popular for familt celebrations
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dumplings and other asian treats,1,40,02/26/13,My son loves soup dumplings and Crystal Jade do them well. There is an excellent range of items to choose from and the pricing is good.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,A bit of Hong Kong in Holland Village!,1,50,02/17/13,"One of my favorite midnight haunts, Crystal Jade Holland V is the goto place for a bowl of steaming hot noodles & porridge. The beef brisket/tendon rice noodles( ngau lam hor) is outstanding. A bit more exotic is the carp fish skin; they used to serve it cold with sliced root ginger, scallions and peanuts, it's simply delicious!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Exquisite Dim Sum,1,50,11/30/12,"To make this clear, the dim sum my family and I ate was at Crystal Jade Golden Palace Restaurant at Paragon (shopping centre) in Orchard Road. Today is the third time we've been here and it's never disappointed.The service is always good - they serve the food fast, clear the empty plates etc fast and your teapot gets refilled regularly. Speaking Mandarin helps since the servers' Mandarin proficiency is way higher than that of their English!Now...the FOOD:The Paos - the BBQ Pork Bun and the Custard Bao have very soft flour that melts in your mouth. The pork is tender and not too salty, but the best part is they got the balance of flour and meat just right. Though the custard pao is just as good, I still prefer the ones from The Cathay at Cathay (which is also along Orchard Road) because the filling has more of an egg taste.Ha Kau - the prawns are fresh and juicy; the flour is not too thick, is smooth and soft.Pan-fried carrot cake - I don't usually like carrot cake, but the way it's cooked doesn't make it too oily. It's just a little burnt, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Panda sweet potato paos - well because of Kai Kai and Jia Jia they have this. The buns look cute but my mum felt the sweet potato wasn't sweet enough. (What an irony.) I thought there was too much flour. It was ok overall.Chee chiong fan - the flour is really smooth and it can glide on your tongue! We've tried the prawn, pork and beef versions and they all taste good. (Plus I really like drinking the soy sauce.) The flour here is awesome!Mashed taro with pumpkin or more fondly known as Or Nee! - I've saved the best for last. This was the best or nee I've ever eaten because the yam paste was amazingly smooth and creamy (but not too thick) and the pumpkin pieces just collapse in your mouth when you chomp down on them. Yam affectionados, this is for you."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Excellent Chinese Food,1,40,11/21/12,Lots of Crystal Jade's around Singapore and can't say I have tried them all but all I have tried have been consistently good. Best to go in a group to try several dishes.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Dim Sum in Singapore,1,40,11/5/2012,"Great brunch place, a bit like Tapas but very Asian dishes.Nice ambiance, good service, could have been better if they were less stressed. Lots of dishes to choose from the menu and would actually advise if you've never had Dim Sum to go with someone local who knows what to order and maybe with a group. Eating alone is not much fun because the amount of the different dishes would be limited and expensive. Dim Sum is a meal you want to share with your family and friends, the more the merrier. Asians would normally order at least 10 different dishes and everybody share !!!Vegetarian food is available on the menu. Try the desserts too !! Enjoy !!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Just excellent!,1,50,10/11/2012,"So there's a number of these in Singapore and I went to the one in Suntec.Service is very good, the setting is a contemporary Chinese feel, the food is to a very high standard and the staff are efficient. It's a good place for a business lunch as they don't hang around getting you your food, but equally don't hassle you out the door as soon as you're finished. Will definitely be there again (in two weeks in fact!)"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Just perfect!,1,50,9/12/2012,"Like every year when I spend my vacation in Singapore I have to go to this restaurant. Typical local food, fast service and good quality. Just love this restaurant! Don't miss it!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,great place for tim sum,1,40,08/22/12,"make sure you try the pau, carrot cake, chicken feet, porridge, xiao long bao and glutinous rice. prices are reasonable. plain water is chargeable though. end the meal with a custard bun with fillings that flows out the moment you bite the bun. yum!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,You can't miss this restaurant,1,50,07/24/12,You will find different Crystal Jade restaurant in different mall in Singapore. You will taste Chinese cuisine. They have great choice for different taste.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Perfect Dim Sum,1,50,07/17/12,Probably my favourite place in Singapore for Dim Sum.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Home away from Home,1,50,7/11/2012,"whenever I feel homesick, this is one place I will fill my stomach with food that reminds me of home"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good quality chinese food,1,40,06/17/12,During lunch they serve good quality dim sum. The standard is guaranteed at Crystal Jade. Service is also generally good. Would recommend their Korean Ginseng Chicken branches for a taste of Korean food
Chinese,Crystal Jade,We love Crystal Jade,1,50,05/28/12,"We love Crystal Jade - find it very difficult to walk past one without popping in for some xiao long bao.
Never disappoints and we've been to most of their outlets e.g. Holland Village, Velo, Orchard, Suntec, Central etc"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Must try more than once,1,40,05/13/12,For great Chinese food in Singapore must dine at Crystal Jade. This brand has many categories and please be sure of what you would like to eat and then choose an outlet accordingly. For me its always been a trial and error. There are certain outlets which have excellent Dim sums and yet some dont have iot on their menu.food is consistently good and the safest restaurant to go to for chinese cuisine. I would not pick on any one dish because everything on their menu is good
Chinese,Crystal Jade,No place better for chinese food,1,50,5/6/2012,"We used to frequent Crystal Jade when we lived in Hong Kong and I was delighted that they are as popular a chain in Singapore as well. They have many different formats for their restaurants, ranging from the regular dining experience to formats which are slightly more expensive and better done up. The food remains consistently good whenever we go, and therefore this remains our first choice when we want to eat good cantonese food. "
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Very good Chinese food,1,40,03/28/12,"If you are looking for fancy and good Chinese place , Crystal Jade is your place. A very good variety of chinese dishes and extremelly tasty."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Food till late,1,40,02/18/12,Crystal Jade @ Holland opens till late. It serves good congee for those who suddenly have craving for it. CJ has a wide variety of delicious congee @ reasonable prices.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Delicious Dim Sum and Porridge,1,40,01/20/12,"A good place for a quick fix for my porridge craving. Dim Sums are available during lunch only. Depending on the outlet you go, most of the service staff are friendly."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Great food!,1,40,11/29/11,"Crystal Jade Palace offers very good quality food though the price may be a bit steep.
Great ambience too."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good Cantonese food,1,40,10/18/11,"Good food, good service, good selection of food and clean restaurant. I went here on a business lunch. It was a little noisy but still was conducive to conversation and business. I'd go back again."
Chinese,Crystal Jade,dim sum in Singapore?,1,40,10/11/2011,"Prawn dumpling, common yet rather difficult to get good quality ones. This restaurant is one of few that we proud to recommend for dim sum breakfast. My kids love the steam prawn dumpling and my mum like the carrot cake. Our favourite is the outlet at Holland Village, you can dine in at 9am and still manage to get your supper at 1am in the morning!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,"A working man's restaurant, Chinese style",1,40,06/16/11,"My Chinese wife loves this place. I think that it reminds her of the old days. It is crowded, noisy, the tables are way too small for the number of dishes one orders, the waitresses are constantly putting dishes on the table or pulling them...More"
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Good and cheap food,1,50,10/23/09,We go to this restaurant to eat Chinese food and we like very much and very good value. We think this is good place for visitors in Singapore and our children also enjoy.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,One of the picks for supper in the west.,1,40,8/3/2008,One of the picks for supper in the west.
Chinese,Crystal Jade,Typical cantonese cuisine and the standard fare from Crystal Jade.,1,40,7/8/2008,Typical cantonese cuisine and the standard fare from Crystal Jade.

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious & reliable ,1,40,07/23/18,"One of the few places left in Singapore with trolley service yum Cha, this is a busy and delicious set up. Good selection of steamed and other dim sum as well as all the usual suspects in Yum Cha. Loud, busy and great for groups- you come here for a good time not a long time! Get there early or late if you don’t want to have to queue!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,1,50,07/19/18,"Yummy yummy yummy especially dimsum, all staffs and service was very good also. I like everything here."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great lunch ,1,50,07/15/18,"We have just had the best Yum Cha in Chinatown in Singapore. Great food, fried noodle scallops, fried crab claws,Beijing duck,roasted pork all really good. Can highly recommend this experience in Chinatown."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Tasty food , decent crowds on a sunday 10am morning ",1,40,7/1/2018,"Family decided to venture to Chinatown for Yum Cha at 10am Sunday morning and was not disappointed. There was no queue but still fairly crowded. Food was great , and had alot of variety with the waiters and waitresses pushing carts of dim sum goodness ! New for this mth includes Bak kut teh Xiao Long Bao which was tasty . If you have a craving for dim sum , pls visit Yum Cha at China town , you will leave the place satisfied ! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Awesome Dim Sum Buffet, great value, nice ambience n great attentive staff",1,40,06/22/18,"Not my first visit to Yum Cha Restaurant, happy that food and service still good. The aunties were very nice and attentive to my kids, ensuring food are served fast so that wont get hungry. Nice variety of dim sums, love most of the items. We enjoyed it. Would be nice if they can have family buffet rates/sets. Think kids do not eat too much so buffet price is slightly high, but overall experience, good!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Dim Sum Restaurant,1,50,06/21/18,A real treat if your visiting China Town. Its located on 2nd floor. A true foodie pit stop you must experience.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,????? ??? ??? ???,1,50,6/1/2018,"????? ??? ?????? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ! ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ??? ???!I must compliment Ms Siew Lan, she was very helpful and we are highly touched with her kind service. We definitely will visit again!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selection of tasty food,1,40,05/19/18,"After a morning at Gardens by the Bay, my group of eight was famished. So we cabbed it to Yum Cha where we ordered so much food we were afraid we had overdone it. We hadn't. We ate it all. My mouth is watering remembering the meal. Four stars instead of five because service was a little chilly and a couple of dumplings were a little gummy (but we were at end of lunch service, which may have contributed to that)."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum at its Best so far,1,40,04/28/18,"After 30 plates of these Dim Sum, we could hardly use words to describe.We give 2 thumbs up, for the variety, freshness, taste & services provided by the staff.Started with 10 bamboo containers all steamed to perfect hotness that even the soup base & prawns within the dumplings are fresh.The place was unassuming, on the 2nd floor but the number of tables occupied tells the tale this weekday afternoon, its now 3 o'clock.the clock reads 5.10 & yet 2 families streamed in with buffet orders.Our last order for desserts & that of the others were all served with smiles by the various staff & Mr Ken Wong stands out asking if we will like to top up the buffet spread.Our teeth is tired could not grind anymore & the stomach says stop.We will be back, Wifey beckon but with our parents & family next.The tea costing $3.50 was superior even for me (tea lover of over 5-8 cups daily).consider this as Hi-tea."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good quality dim sim,1,40,04/16/18,"Been here a few times whenever I’m in Singapore, and haven’t been disappointed. For a change their congee with century eg is pretty god, and so is their chinese turnip cake. I can’t fault their service, which is generally fast and efficient and that’s it. It’s in an interesting part of town and the atmosphere is genuinely good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum in China town,1,40,04/15/18,A lot of variety of dim sum to choose from. Food is delicious. But be prepared to queue for one hour. Price is reasonable.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Attentive service and nice ambience ,1,50,02/23/18,"We happened to dine here as Tak Po is closed down, and we enjoyed our lunch a lot. During CNY there are many ppl doing “lo hei” thus the restaurant is quite noisy. This is how new year supposed to be . Dim sum was serviced with trolleys, they approach the table very frequently and friendly enough to show and explain to us. You can see the restaurant signage from far. However it’s on the second floor thus it may be a bit tricky to find the entrance. I enjoyed the squid dumpling (I can’t remember the name , it’s black color dumpling ) the most You can inform the staff to remove the peanuts when it’s serviced at the beginning if you don’t need it. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best dim sum meals I’ve had ,1,50,01/20/18,"A friend in Singapore recommended this place and I wasn’t disappointed. They kept bringing round dim sum on trolleys and it was very reasonably priced, spacious and air conditioned. Definitely worth the short wait to get in."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Right place to try Dim Sum in singapore,1,50,11/16/17,"With review from trip advisor wanted to try some original dim sum . The ones we get in India are the indianised version with 3 choices .( steamed fried or Schzwan ) . We tried 5 of the numerous choices ( Xiao Long Bao ,Fish Roe with Siew Mai ,Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ,Fried Carrot Cake , and a green colored open looking one forgot the name ). The Crab meat with Thick Corn Soup was plenty for us a family with 2 kids . we also had Braised Ee-Fu Noddles and the total bill after tips was 80 SGD . Most of the crowd where locals and YUM CHA is placed partly hidden in china street . But if you can look in google street view in maps I think you can easily locate the place . except for the fried carrot cake and the endless jasmine tea we loved all the food . it is an excellent try out for anyone looking for exceptional food in Singapore . The asst captain( as the badge read ) was a pleasent and very helpful girl and the atmosphere can't be better as we are in china town .You are reminded that it is china town so don't expect plates forks knifes e.t.c . When in Rome be a Roman . I looked at the way the locals where eating with chopsticks and bowl and followed suit ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,reasonable and good taste,1,40,08/30/17,This restaurant is very reasonable in this expansive city. There are lots of variety in food served by wagons in an old style.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice dim sum,1,40,7/6/2017,"Sui mai and ha gao are quite nice. But what I like most is chicken cooked in paper,chicken wings are tender and sauce is tasty,I can feel a scent of ginger and soya sauce."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dinner Gathering TPL,1,40,7/2/2017,"Simple team dinner @ Yumcha, the Service staff was quite friendly and helpful with all our requests."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Better than average,1,40,06/19/17,Food was good. Not too crowded. More on the pricey side though. Quite small serving for the porridge.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not too bad,1,40,6/11/2017,"Decided to bring my colleague since it's her first time in Singapore for some dim sum. There was a short line and around a 15 minute waiting time before we were seated. Because we went on a Saturday, the buffet was sadly not available.My favourite was the dumpling with fish maw at the base. Because items are pushed around in trolleys, we mainly grabbed what ever looked good without knowing the names. The soup dumpling though was quite disappointing because it lacked flavour and the skin was really thick. Overall it wasn't too bad. Not the worst but not the best either."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good restaurant for dim sim lovers near Chinatown,1,40,05/19/17,The bill for 4 is from 70 to 100 SGP including refilled Jasmine tea. Good place to have lunch while other restaurants open after 12 which is quite late for my stomach. Try Crispy salmon skin and Shark fin with meat dumplings.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great,1,40,04/30/17,"Dim sum are yummy. Must try stem pork ribs, tenderror and juicy. Definitely will come back again for the good dim sum."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Love the dim sum trolley service,1,40,04/20/17,"Now that trolley service has all but disappeared on the London dim sum scene it was a real treat to see it in action in Singapore. A decent selection of both steamed and fried dim sum, the usual suspects like ha gau and siu mai but a few unusual dishes I had not seen before too. If you couldn't see what you wanted on the trolley just ask and it would emerge from the kitchen. Portion wise its like it used to be in London about 30 years ago but where London got smaller these portions remained ample!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food and good services,1,40,03/24/17,But the restaurant did not received my chope reservation. Luckily there are enough seats for 7 of us.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice ambience,1,50,02/26/17,"Good food and nice ambience, highly recommend the xiao long bao! Service was good and the staff were friendly and helpful in recommendation of dishes"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Noisy busy and crowded for lunch – with very good food,1,40,02/26/17,"This is a great place for dim sum, but not if you’re a novice. It’s too crowded to bring around carts so you can see what you’re getting. So you order everything off a paper menu by noting how many of a particular dish you want. So if you don’t mind the noise and can go with someone who knows their way around dim sum, the food is excellent."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Service was impeccable!,1,50,02/20/17,"We had a good quantity of dim sum and we spent considerable amount of time in the restaurant. I must say, the service was simply impeccable. They took care to attend to every single detail; including ensuring that we ate the item while it was hot; and ensuring that our tea cups were always filled. I was impressed and touched."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you like dim sum,1,40,2/11/2017,"If you are a dim sum amateur, here is a restaurant for you in the heart of Chinatown not far from the interesting Chinatown heritage center.Essentially patronized by locals, there are few foreigners which is a good indication.I loved the scallops and green peas dim sum as well as the traditional siu mai.When you arrive at your table ask for the illustrated menu if you are not familiar with the food and fill up the form and waive it to the waiter. Service is minimal and the cashier doesn't even look at you ! But the lunch was an enjoyable classic."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,fabulous dimsum,1,50,2/8/2017,"We went there near to chinese new year and we almost did not found the entrance who is surrounded by shops . Plenty of yummy Dimsum of all sorts . This is not a fancy restaurant , its quite noisy , but its clean , the service is good , and you will pay about 15dollars , not more ."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,1,40,2/3/2017,"We went here twice and enjoyed dim sum. The restaurant is usually quite crowded but I don't believe you need reservations. Lots of choices and the prices are reasonable. It is located in Chinatown. It is a little hard to find but follow the ""tea cup"" symbols which are their logo. It is on the second floor of a building."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown food,1,40,01/28/17,"Shaky staircase leads into a bustling restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Carts in the room, laden with baskets pork ribs with sweet potatoes, yams and samami dim sum with shrimp and spinach make an impression even on those who are Asia - a sweet home."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the best places to eat in Chinatown,1,50,12/27/16,"I've read some articles about this restaurant, and convinced me to give it a try. It is located among the major streets in Chinatown area. The ambience is not that attractive, however people keep on coming back for its taste. I highly recommend the xiao long bao, and their garlic pork."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Peking Duck,1,40,10/18/16,"Had the peking duck. They offer a half duck order so it was just right for me. They come to the table to carve it up and make wraps for you. They did it a little differently though, they rolled a piece of skin with with a pretty large chunk of green onion and cucumber. I would have much preferred if they julienne the green onion into small pieces. The duck also didn't have much flavor compared to other times I've had it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tim sum in China town,1,40,07/29/16,"Excellent tim sum in an old house in the center of China town. The quality remains equal through the years, i have never been desppointed. Efficient service. I recommand this restaurant for a genuine Chinese dinner"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinese food ,1,40,07/27/16,"We were looking to just have some Dim Sum for dinner in Chinatown, and decided on this one based on a combination of location (from where we were) and menu. We just ordered nine different dishes and shared everything.I especially enjoyed the Scallop Pea-shoot Dumplings and Prawn & Mango Sesame Fritters. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum,1,40,07/21/16,"Really large range of Dim Sum, all that we tasted were excellent. Service was fast. Bit of a tricky place to find, but worth it."

Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not bad,1,40,7/4/2016,"The staff were very attentive and food wasn't bad. Very near MRT and not too crowded. Not exactly cheap, but good variety and service was good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Worth a visit,1,40,7/1/2016,"This is a very pleasant and bustling restaurant in Chinatown that should certainly be visited at least once, as they accommodated us well. The air conditioned dining area has a casual feel and attentive, if slightly pushy, staff that endeavour to please, even if they do not sometimes understand exactly what you want.We ordered creamy corn soup, wok fried chicken with stir fried local vegetables and scrambled egg and the stir fried fish fillet which were piping hot, good portioned and served without waiting too long."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Our Favourite Dim Sum Place in China Town - Breakfast,1,40,06/28/16,"No Doubt you can find many other dim sum restaurants in Singapore, but at the end of the day, we always come back to this one ! Mid-low price range, air-conditioned, no queue (if you can be there earlier or make reservation for bigger group, we always visit there on Sunday 9.30am - NO QUEUE)We love it because the food is good and the ambience is very Oriental. They serve dim sum on different push-carts during the weekend. A casual eateries located in the middle of ChinaTown. If you are visiting China Town this is one of the must-go (we always bring our visitors here and they loved it). 2 Person spent around $30 for dim sum brunch. (not bad)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious and lots of choices,1,40,06/19/16,"Craving yum cha, my hotel pointed me to this restaurant.
I was alone but starving!
I had 5 different types of yum cha and they were all great.
Definitely worth a visit in Chinatown ?? !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Thesangas,1,40,05/26/16,"This our forth time we have eaten at this restaurant, it didn't disappoint . This authentic dim sum is the best in Chinatown we were the only non chinese in the restaurant which says a lot about the food . Great value for money."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Mini holiday,1,40,05/19/16,"We ate at yum Cha as part of out Chinatown tour, there was quite a variety of food to try from the set menu. We did not leave hungry !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic Chinese fare,1,40,5/12/2016,This yum cha (dim sum) place is the best and most authentic I have been to in Singapore. While we were there there was only 1 other non Chinese in the restaurant which I think says a lot about the food because the Chinese really love to eat. My friend and I shared 9 dishes and 2 pots of tea for a total of S $69.Great value
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great yum cha...but...,1,40,5/10/2016,"This place is excellent - lots of choices, little servings of everything so you can try as much as possible, cheap(ish) for Singapore and quality, efficient service. The only disappointing thing was that you had to have shark fin Xiao Long Bao. I love this dish but don't like contributing to the practice of killing off the world's sharks. Get the dumplings in chili oil and the pork buns. Bon appetit! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy Yum Cha,1,40,04/24/16,"This Ym Cha Restaurant is located on the first floor in Chinatown (20 Trengganu Street), and it is somewhat difficult to find. There are two entrances - one from the five-foot way hidden by souvenir stalls while the other from the entrance of Jinshan Hotel. From the former, ascend a flight of steps and from the latter, an escalation. The food is quite tasty and price reasonable. The service is efficient. If you are a first timer, you will probably be hungry and sweaty by the time you find this restaurant that straddles 3 shop lots on the second floor."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food and service,1,40,04/23/16,Same names for all the dim sum dishes I have eaten all over the world. Here the dishes are not as oily. Some of the same name dishes made a little different but all great. Place does need a major update and lift needs to be fixed.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dimsum,1,40,03/17/16,The Dimsum was really good and the price is affordable. The steam fish maw in shrimp paste is good. The restaurant area was quite big.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Quite original, Tasty Dimsum",1,40,03/16/16,"Every time i come and stay around Chinatown area in Singapore, i always like to visit and eat Dimsum in this restaurant. Located just very near to Chinatown MRT, it is easy to find. The dimsum selection is quite original and most of them are good and tasty. The price is also still quite reasonable.So every time when i'm craving for some dimsum in Singapore, this restaurant will come in mind and so far it has not disappoint my taste bud. Recommended!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dim Sum,1,40,3/1/2016,"Lava Bun is the best. Dim Sum is great and resonable price. Restaurant is easy to find. If you are in that area, give it a try!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,mmm mmm mmm mmm,1,40,02/21/16,"Yum Cha has become my favourite dim sum restaurant in Singapore - buzzy atmosphere, Malacca style tables, trolley service, great dumplings and grumpy staff in the middle of Chinatown. Perfect ! You can also visit the nearby temple if heading this way. The dumpling pastry is excellent and the range of fillings pretty good - the one downside from this diver's view point is that the restaurant still offers a couple of dishes with shark's fin. Ho, hum. Is everything good ? No, I was disappointed by the cheung fun and the lotus leaf wrapped rice got the thumbs down as well. You may have to wait for a table at peak times but the turnover is quick and the queue orderly. Note that there are three ways of getting to Yum Cha, which is on the first (second in Singapore) floor, if you are laden or have a push chair - the stairs, and round the corner either an escalator or a lift. The well chilled beer is by the glass or by the pitcher, and tea is a good, non-alcoholic alternative. When you are starving and the trolleys arrive too slowly you can always ask one of the staff for the plates that you want and, if the sauce is a little for your taste just request some chopped chilli in soya. The greens of the day are fresh and cooked to order. Oh, and the price is very reasonable - maybe half that of London's Chinatown."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious dim sum,1,40,2/6/2016,"Very crowded dim sum restaurant where they bring the food around with carts for you to choose your selections. You can also request things directly from the servers. Besides your traditional dim sum choices, they also have Singaporean Carrot Cake. (For those not in the know, this is not a dessert, nor does it contain carrots, that I could tell). Get a seat by the window to watch the hustle & bustle of Chinatown go by as you stuff yourself silly. Service was on the slower side, but allowed us time to enjoy a relaxed brunch."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Yum Cha,1,40,2/6/2016,"Hidden away in China town this little treasure has great food, quick service. The venue ambiance is cheap but so is the bill. You won't need a mortgage to eat here and the food is great. Go and enjoy"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,old fashion dim sum with push carts,1,50,01/31/16,Was delighted to find that this dimsum restaurant has pushcarts. Rather than ordering from a menu you get to order the old fashioned way from old women pushing the carts of hot dimsum around. This plae looks like a blast from the past -- like the dimsum restaurants I remember when I was a child
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum sensation ,1,50,01/16/16,"Authentic Dim sum restaurant with waitresses pushing the dim sum trolley, you would feel the same in Hong Kong. Crowded even during lunch which shows how popular and affordable it is.
Strongly recommended!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Brunch spot - cantonese style,1,50,01/14/16,"I enjoyed every visit I had to Yum Cha restaurant. The Dim Sum dishes are not oily nor too salty. I recommend all their steamed dishes and also the custard buns. The Chinese tea served is of good quality too. We spent SGD68 (including service charge and GST) on 12 dishes, a pot of tea and the peanuts/papertowel. The place is very noisy though it seems to bring you back in time to the old days of Singapore, or feels like in Macau dimsum cafes."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food in Chinatown,1,40,1/3/2016,Great spot for dining in Chinatown. The mango prawn is a must I reckon. Not particularly cozy though.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Authentic, wonderful food - perfunctory service",1,40,12/26/15,"A really great meal in a nice environment, but the service is strange ... we ordered soup, dim sum, main courses, rice and vegetables and every dish was delivered together, all at once within five minutes ... when we asked if they could keep the food hot so we could eat the soup first, we were not accommodated ... when we finished, no one asked if we wanted dessert or if we wanted a check ... we just sat and sat and sat until the entire restaurant cleared and still no one came to the table ... the staff just proceeded cleaning up and ignored us ... it was a wonderful meal but a bizarre experience ... it was not until we asked that we were told to go to the cashier ... "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Love it!!,1,40,11/29/15,"The mango prawn fritters, all sorts of porridge, and scallop dumplings are amazing (along with all the other options.. wasn't disappointed with anything) !!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Group dining,1,40,11/19/15,"We were having a group dinner with a friend who just came back from overseas. Friend was craving dim sum so badly. Food and service was really good. However, Yum Cha serves only limited selection of dim sum for dinner. Would be good if there are more dim sum options for dinner."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of our favourite places to eat when visiting Singapore,1,50,11/12/2015,"Busy, friendly environment to eat, with a variety of delicious dishes. The staff are friendly and attentive. Dim sum are excellent"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable good food with nice ambiance in Chinatown,1,50,11/12/2015,"We enjoyed the food. They are tasty and above average. Reasonable price too. Good location right in the heart of Chinatown. A little challenging to locate the entrance though.I booked using Chope and it was a breeze. I received confirmation via email almost instantly despite it was late at night and the night before a public holiday. However, the staff at Yum Cha told me that they do not accept booking on public holidays. I was adviced to feedback to Chope. The queue was long at the restaurant and no way I could let my guests wait in the queue. Thankfully the staff was nice to honour the booking. She got one table for us after 10 mins which I was very thankful. I hope Chope can sort out the booking policies with the participating restaurants to prevent such incidents."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dim Sumg lunch ever,1,50,11/8/2015,If you want to have an excellent dim sum meal this is your restaurant. Plan to take your time it truly is an authentic Chinese restaurant we enjoyed over 18 different varieties of food all very good
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Not the best, but decent enough",1,40,10/17/15,"Preference for dim sum in Singapore is Red Star, but we couldn't get a booking, so opted for this place insteadWe also had my relatives in from Hong Kong and so finding a decent dim sum was essentialThe restaurant itself is nothing to write home about, but nevertheless, still very popular - especially with passing tourists wandering through ChinatownWe were a table of 11 and so lots of dishes were being ordered and when the aunties with their dim sum trollies caught on that it was a table of Hong Kongers, they scrambled to show off their dishes, hoping they diners would be impressedThe char siu buns went down well, but my relatives found the portions to be extremely small for the priceHowever, we all left satisfied enough"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yumcha@chinatown,1,50,10/17/15,"Gd dim sum, value for $ buffet dimsum. Have to ask the staffs to change your table to a cooler location if u r afraid of sweating while enjoying your hot food ?"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,excellent dim sum in a traditional setting,1,50,10/16/15,"this long time restaurant on the second floor in Chinatown has terrific dim sum with many options and great tasting dim sum.we went around 3 pm (just as the dim sum all you can eat for high tea was starting) but ordered fewer items off the menu. The choices were varied, tasty, not oily and fun!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,it's great place to have dimsum!,1,40,10/6/2015,"it stays in 2nd floor of the building on Temple St., China Town. Opening time is from 09:00 am.it's great place for gathering family. their dim sum is delicious, great & deserved with its price.they will not give you any menu, each staff that takes care for some dishes with trolley; will come to your table and asks whether you would like to have dishes -> such a nice experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum,1,50,10/3/2015,"Probably the best dim sum in my admittedly limited experience. I like that its a little hidden, up some stairs and around a corner (though not hard to find), making it feel like a respite from the busy touristy street below. There was a healthy mix of tourists and locals, and no question as to the authenticity. Prices are very reasonable. Service is a little business-like, but not unfriendly and frankly that seems the norm at dim sum places. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lunch with Dim Sum at Yum Cha,1,50,10/3/2015,"Head upstairs in the heart of Chinatown to probably the best Dim Sum house in Singapore. Full of character and served with traditional trolleys. The food is delicious and varied with a few items that you might not have seen elsewhere - such as the squid ink dumplings. The yam dumplings, Cheung Fun and Char Sui Bau are traditional favourites. It is hard to go wrong."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Beautiful taste ,1,40,09/29/15,Dim Sum is the best in Chinatown comparing with other famous restaurant. Price is not that expensive. Better try this shop!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Perennial,1,40,9/10/2015,"I first came here 10+ years ago when the place still had ceiling fans, now replaced by air conditioning, but no matter when or what, the food has maintained consistency. I have been several times now, but I have only just reviewed it.Dim sum dishes are plentiful. We also ordered a fish and on occasion I have watched my friends order chilli crab. The food service is very fast - he kitchen must be efficient.It is the sort of place that the locals go to, so give it a try. I am sure you will like the place."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum restaurant,1,50,9/9/2015,"A friend of mine had recommended this restaurant as a good lunchtime venue and he was certainly correct. It is on a corner location and two stories up via escalator. Not too busy when we arrived about 12.30pm. Huge choice of dishes on menu. You just mark on the menu how many portions of each dish you require and the waiter then collects. All the dishes were freshly cooked and served without delay. Great value for money, for a change, in this rather expensive city."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not as bad as people say,1,40,9/9/2015,This is like a classic old school dim sum restaurant. Yes if they give u clean wipes and pickles/ nuts they will charge u for them but this is quite normal. The Ha Kow was very good. The chicken Wings in a bag were too oily for me. The cheung fan with prawns was average but not bad. Overall I give this place a 4 and was glad I tried it
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food haven,1,40,9/6/2015,Authentic Cuisine at affordable prices. very good ventilation. with so many choices from ducks to pork to chili crabs.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Classic style Chinese tea room,1,40,9/5/2015,Dumplings etc were good and service was very attentive. We were there with our 9-month old twins and the staff were fantastic with them.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old dim sum restaurant in chinatown,1,40,9/1/2015,"This restaurant is located on the second floor in chinatown area. The restaurant is spaces and bright. Usually crowded during lunch time. Very traditionally decorated to give you a feel of the old times. The food is considered reasonably priced compared to restaurants in the prime area like orchard road. Food is good. I ordered steam ""char siu"" rice rolls, fried glutinous rice, steam char siu bun, deep fried yam, fried silver fish etc."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for dim sum ,1,50,08/28/15,Visited hear for dim sum while shopping after being highly recommended and it surely never disappointed. Even though we arrived close to closing time the food quality was great and the service was good also. Priced decently and surely not too expensive. If your around the area I would definitely recommend this place. A must visit! #amit1chahal
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Sunday Yum Cha,1,40,08/25/15,Our visiting Australian is crazy on Yum Chas but only likes the ones that has trolley service. Yum Cha Restaurant in China town is one such place that offers a trolley service but only on weekends. we got there about `215 in the afternoon and the wait was about 15 mins. once we got a table the trolleys were there and it seemed as though they were in a hurry to get you out as soon as possible. all up the quality of the Yum Cha was good and there were a few items not seen on the traditional Yum cha menu. all up very good and $15 corkage fee for a bottle of wine was not to bad. will go again.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good morning with Dim sum ,1,40,08/24/15,"We visit Yum cha reataurant at Chinatown, It's on second floor, a big place with many tables. Many custom are a long queue, should be booking before. Dim sum food has excellent menu, many kind of stream food, fried food and dessert with egg tart."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Visitor,1,50,08/21/15,"Average food and reasonably priced Place a bit drabby, could do with some refurbishment and upgrade of the whole area."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum heaven,1,50,08/19/15,"Yum Cha serves a variety of dim sum. Trolleys roll by frequently for you to make a choice. Or you can place an order. Service is quick. There are always queues, but it moves quickly. If you are trying dim sum for the first time, read up a bit on it so you know what you are ordering. We go often, never been disappointed. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very good dim sum! ,1,40,8/10/2015,"This restaurant specialises in dim sum. We were advised to come to this place by family. We were told to expect to wait for table as it's always busy, we awaited approx 10 minutes for a table of 8. The way it works is each table has a list of all the food and drinks available and the food is cooked to go, some ladies bring the food round as it's cooked and you have to tell them what you want off the trolley and they write down how many you've hadn't the card, at the end of the meal you take the card to the till and pa for what you have eaten. You have to be patient because the trolley goes around the whole restaurant. You can order specific foods that aren't on trolleys and the waiter will order it to be cooked (again please be patient) it's not a quick service but the food is absolutely amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum ,1,40,07/29/15,"We liked the food! Prices were reasonable, service friendly. Good place to go when looking for dim sum. If you want to get a table for sure, make a reservation!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum is good,1,40,07/26/15,"The decor is nothing special and I've seen greater variety of Dim Sum selection, however the six Dim Sum dishes we ordered were very fresh and tasty, the price was okay - not too cheap (about 5 SGD per steam basket) but fine for what we got for the money. Staff seemed busy even though the restaurant was only half full, but were helpful when we needed anything."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,average dining experience,1,40,07/25/15,"staff were very busy and had no time to attend to us.
the aircon was not strong enough, especially for a hot and humid afternoon."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"A bit hard to find, but worth it!",1,40,07/21/15,"We really wanted dumplings, this was recommended by the hotel. It had an address of Trengganu street in Chinatown, but it is actually around the corner on Smith street, upstairs. Great food, attentive service, OMG the garlic on the garlic prawns.....there was a lot. Lovely dumplings!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Yum Cha,1,40,7/8/2015,"If you want good Yum Cha without the tourist trimmings - this is for you. Set up a long flight of stairs, hidden amongst China Town shops - well worth the fine. You will get a good feed here of quality local food without the grandeur.Basic seating, restaurant has no view but is cool. Service is ok - but the food is why you are here and it delivers.Would definitely be back."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful,1,50,7/4/2015,"One of the best Yum Cha's i have had, great food and service. Well priced and good variety of dishes. really easy and fresh."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dimsum Restaurant in Singapore,1,50,06/30/15,"Yum Cha is located in China Town Singapore, which is the place is less noticeable. But they served the best dim sum I ever taste. The LoMaKay (sticky rice with pork meat and salted egg, wrapped with lotus leaf) is the best ever. The Shu May also good. They also served the various soup menu and also porridgeLittle bit pricey, but totally worthed."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Food is delicious but the price is a little bit expensive,1,40,06/28/15,"One of the most delicious dim sun restaurant in Singapore. But you must be careful about the price which does not include 10% service charge, 7% government tax, towel and peanuts on the table."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dim sum,1,40,06/20/15,"Recommended to me by a taxi driver. The restaurant can be difficult to find- the sign is a teapot and upstairs.
Only had the dim sum which was good and hot, service fairly average and prices OK"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum,1,40,06/19/15,This restaurant was a little hard to find. We passed the entrance and had to back track to find it. . . maybe it's just us. We were there before 11:00 and the place was packed. Really enjoyed the dim sum that they brought around with the carts. I can't speak Chinese but the ladies were nice enough to show me all the different dishes she was carrying. I like to eat my dim sum with some soy sauce but there isn't any on the table. Just ask the server and they will give you a small dish. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Wonderful Food,1,50,04/30/15,"Found the restaurant when in China town,my friend ordered and what a fabulous Dim Sum lunch we had. Was introduced to some really different food.The menu was large ,food was hot in temperature ,good service,friendly and typical Chinese atmosphere,thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Restaurant was busy with Chinese and Europeans.What a treat and will definitely go back on my next visit.The Singapore noodles were wonderful which is one of my favourites and a huge portion.It certainly was worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great tour stop,1,40,04/30/15,"We took the Singapore Chinatown By Night tour and one of the stops was for a meal at ""Yum Cha"". What a brilliant, yet simple, meal. There were 12 on the tour and we were seated at two tables with 6 on each. We love Chinese food and it was really good in a way that everyone could enjoy. The way the locals were tucking in to their food showed that they were enjoying their experience too. It looked like it would be a great place to eat at any time. The only problem was that we were kept waiting, on of the party spent too much time in the markets!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Quality Dim Sum,1,40,04/14/15,Really decent quality dim sum without the usual surly waitress service. Nice to be able to watch through a window into a prep area where they make the dumplings etc. High quality but pricey with it and a bit put off by the coach parties of well-heeled tourists. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Freshly prepared and tasty Dim Sum with an efficient service, but quite pricey",1,50,03/28/15,"We had lunch at Yum Cha and tried a variety of dishes. Without exception the dishes came to the table hot, freshly prepared and were tasty.The service was efficient and empty dishes were cleared from our table promptly.One of the best Dim Sum i have had anywhere in the world, but overall quite expensive."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Loved it!,1,40,3/10/2015,"We were in Singapore for a brief stopover, and had found details in guidebook. It was a little had to find, given all the stalls in Trengganu street. We were not sure we had the right place but several businessmen and other locals went past us in rapid succession, obviously intent on a quick lunch. We were seated quickly, in a sparsely decorated restaurant. The waitress was a little gruff, but attentive nonetheless and she warmed up over our lunch. Although she had little English, she pointed out an additional dish we may not have tried, the bean curd and shrimp dumplings. We ordered from the menu, and ordered a variety of dishes, including BBQ pork bun, chilled baby octopus in sesame, crispy wonton, steamed pork in garlic and chilli, prawn and wood ear fungus dumplings, and our favourite, mango prawn fritters with sesame. She also understood when we ordered just one small plate of fried carrot cake (3 pieces) between 6 of us, and offered to cut it in smaller portions so we could all satisfy our curiosity. We reordered three dishes because they were so good, but then we were struggling to finish it off. The almond tea was lovely, but some of our party ordered beer. We agreed it was the best yum cha we had eaten in 20 years. The bill came to around $30 singapore per head, but understand we ate a lot! Happy to recommend, but you really don't need to try the fried carrot cake. Everything else was excellent. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sums with some great varieties,1,40,3/10/2015,Excellent dim sums with some good varieties - particularly for someone like me visiting from the UK. Be prepared to wait in a queue on the weekends but it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. Essentially the restaurant serves dim sums on a trolley and one just picks their selection. Had some different varieties like squid ink dim sums which were delicious! The pastry around the dim sums was thin and well made.Service was no different than any other average Chinese restaurant.All in all worth a visit on the weekends...
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha Is A Singapore Star,1,40,3/10/2015,"@TheKuoKnowsYum Cha is not the easiest restaurant to find. But do persevere. It is really worth the bother, especially if you enjoy stepping back in time into a piece of old Singapore as much as I do.Yum Cha does away with many of the frills that other di"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinatown Gem,1,40,02/18/15,"For those who are unsure about eating off the hawker street stalls, Yum Cha is a gem in the middle of Chinatown. We tried the afternoon Dimsum Buffet and left completely satisfied. The staff were polite and helpful as we explored the unfamiliar menu and ordering routine. Going in a group of four meant that we were able to sample a broad range of what was on offer with no left overs - note that the restaurant has an excellent policy for the buffet of charging for wasteage. The key to the buffet is to order little and often to make sure that your eyes don't exceed you stomach! The dimsum arrived freshly prepared and with little delay. We would advise others to arrive earlier in the afternoon - we came at 16.30 which left us a little tight for the 17.30 ordering curfew - and take your time to enjoy the buffet to its full extent. Do leave enough space for the excellent deserts we especially enjoyed the custard tarts and mango pudding though the almond tea was a pleasant surprise. For non fish eaters - avoid the steamed white carrot cake - it's VERY fishy. The lavender and coconut steamed balls would also be better saved for desert. If you are not hearty eaters then consider ordering a la carte as the reasonable prices may be better value than the buffet. We found the restaurant to be well signposted despite the extra street activity of Chinese new year - signage was clear if you looked up while walking along!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dimsum Heaven,1,50,02/15/15,"I travel for Dimsum and have loved other dimsum such as the one in NYC China Town and SF's China Town. I can compare their siomai (pork and shrimp) texture, flavor to both. Its so good we order quite a bit of it. You can't go wrong. Eat with your eyes and then try everything!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Different but good,1,40,2/8/2015,"This restaurant was very popular the staff were attentive and service was quick. Recommend the BBQ Pork Bun, Shark's Fin with Meat Dumpling. The Prawn & Mango sesame Fritters were different but nice.BBQ Pork Flour Roll again never had them before but OK. Shredded Chicken Congee were very good and for desert we had Crispy Red Bean with Banana were also very nice. Would recommend this restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,nice place to take your visitors.,1,40,2/5/2015,"it is in china town, a bit diffiult to find the entrance, specially during Chines New Year with so many stalls. but it is good place for dimsums . They still go around the restaurant with trolleys showing off the food. So jut pick inside the bamboo box and choose what you fancy most. very reasonable priced, Quality is fine but not the fine dinning level.No reservation on saturday or sunday. Just send an advance person to start the queue. Nice place for a family gathering or with friends."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese High Tea,1,50,01/25/15,"If you are looking for a dim sum type experience and you look at the time and think "" missed it"", do not despair. Yum Cha has their version of a high tea dim sum (no carts, just a menu with pics) from 3-6pm, but you must arrive by 5 or they will tell you its last order before you order anything! All the food is delicious, shrimp and mango rolls, paper chicken wings, custard buns, you name it and it is made to perfection.As is the case in many Chinatown eateries , the service can be gruff and dismissive but for me that's all part of the charm.You will find this place upstairs, try to get a table by the window and watch the Chinatown chaos go on below you while you enjoy perfectly cooked food and deliciously hot Jasmine tea."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great variety of Dim Sum,1,40,01/17/15,"We didn't have to wait for too long to be seated. They gave us Chinese menu and never came back for the order. We didn't know the waitors would come with dim sum trolley. We just had to point and speak. But our table was in the corner where the waitors didn't seem to notice we were there. A bit unorganized service, ortherwise, great variety of delicious food!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Place for Brunch (dim sum)!,1,40,1/9/2015,Long queue but worth it. Good place with great taste for dim sum. Fast service/serving. Will be back again when visit SG.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Typical Singapore,1,50,1/9/2015,"very traditional and typical Singaporean Dim sum, cozy atmosphere,traditional ambience, amazing and very helpful staff.Cook very well presented and cooked to perfection,Located right in the middle of Chinatown on a second floor corner.The place is a little difficult to find because of all the little stores lining up the alleyway, once you find it and go up the stairs the place opens up to a pretty nice dining room, very cozy and warm.Will definitely visit again on my next trip."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Singaporean Dim Sum,1,40,1/7/2015,"You get a very comfortable dining experience with the no-frills dim sum spread against a very cozy ambiance, notably the marble tables and classic wooden seats i.e. very typical Singaporean style. I like their har gows and siew mais, which is consistently tasty and good. Their porridge is also worth mentioning cooked to the right texture. As for dessert, make sure you try their banana pancake."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Traditional Dim sum restaurant. Worth a visit,1,40,1/3/2015,When in Chinatown this is a great option for Dim Sum. Whilst it is in the heart of Chinatown it is a little hard to find the first time as its on the first floor and the entrance is not particularly well signposted. We thoroughly enjoyed Yum Cha and visited it several times when in Singapore. Staff are friendly and the food was delicious. 
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Vignette of history!,1,40,12/29/14,"Good to be back after many years and see things are still mostly the same. The dim sum still being carted along the aisles which has disappeared from so many restaurants in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hongkong as was commonplace before. The quality is good to very good.I especially enjoyed the chicken wings in paper bag, steamed sticky riceParcels, and the hargao dumplings. Good, fast service and very reasonable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very reliable dim sum in the heart of Chinatown,1,40,12/27/14,"VIsited Yum Cha numerous times and think they deserve a good review after my visit this afternoonLocation - easily accessible via train/bus as it is in the heart of Chinatown. its on 2nd floor of the hotelFood - tried both dim sum in the morning/noon as well as Chinese dinner in the evening. Good quality, and fresh. Most important - food is served piping hot. If you are on dim sum go int he morning/noon as the selection of dim sum is less on dinner session. typical fare like char siew bao, prawn dumpling, siew mai are very good.Service - very good - i love the fact that a lot of staff are middle age but still very enthusiastic and friendly.Pricing - not the cheapest in Chinatown if you compare to Tak Po, but that is a complete ballgame all together.tips : - do not be tempted to order everything in 1 go no matter how big is your group. order 1st round a few items, see what you like and order again! then you get to enjoy piping hot dim sum rather than a table-full of lukewarm dim sum. - Remember to enjoy your dim sum with a pot of hot Chinese tea.- do not be intimidated by the menu that looks very extensive especially if you are new to dim sum. there is no right or wrong way to enjoy the good Chinese meal."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha! Enormous variety of tasty morsels,1,50,12/24/14,"Above the Santa Teresa Hotel, there is a lift if stairs aren't good for you! You either arrive early for lunch or dinner, or you will need to queue. I hate queues, but we did on our second visit because I knew what was coming. Yum Cha is frequented by locals too.... That is what I always look for! There are pictures and descriptions of every option and all you do is fill in your menu card and the food arrives. The food itself is amazing!Great place to be adventurous in your food selections and for us, we learnt more about how to blend flavours. This is a place we are still talking about and a friend is armed with the address for his visit in the New Year. TIP...... Get there about 1130 or slightly earlier for lunch if you do not like to wait and go armed with accurate directions."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good & tasty authentic dim-sum,1,40,12/14/14,"Almost all the dim-sum served are delicious, steamingly hot & in perfectly big sizes.
Lots of varieties which included Chinese noodles, fried rice, seafood and hot & cold Chinese dessert."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dim sum in Chinatown ,1,40,11/6/2014,"We frequently go to Yum Cha for dim sum on a weekend either to dine in the restaurant or get take away. Efficient service and amazing dumplings and, for those who struggle finding vegetables that aren't swimming in oil in the food centres in Singapore, the broccoli is great! "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy,1,40,10/29/14,My friends and I visited for lunch. We choose a la carte so we filled in the order form and all our selections were brought to us. The lavender coconut dumpling was AMAZING! Prompt service and reasonably priced esp for Singapore.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent Dimsum,1,50,10/27/14,Worth the wait. Went there with family for Sunday Lunch...line to get in or get a table is long. best to get a reservation instead.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not to be missed in Chinatown,1,40,10/17/14,"People say that this is arguably the best dimsum in Singapore. Nice tradtional shophouse atmosphere, fresh dumplings, easily accessible by train, and in the heart of Chinatown. Great value for money as part of the Singapore experience."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dumplings and other yummy...,1,40,10/16/14,"meals are served in the nice location in a Shophouse in the middle of Chinatown - if you do not have the exact location, the restaurant is a little hard to find! Great food...not very very cheap, but very reasonable. Service....well, Singapore like most of the times! Still a place I would send people to go to and enjoy...top tip: dessert: Glutinous rice balls in a Ginger Tea. A must try...!!!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice Chinese breakfast,1,50,09/27/14,"It's in the Chinatown, you can experience the old Chinese dim sum restaurant. Food selection is excellent, taste is good and price is reasonable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dumplings in the heart of China Town,1,40,09/14/14,"Right in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha has the atmosphere revered by locals and tourists alike. It's always packed at lunch hour which ensures freshly baked dumplings by the minute. The crunchy banana& bean paste deep fried dumpling is the best way to finish a large selection of dim sums. And the top it all it's not expensive, always a bonus!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Small little Dim Sum place that's value for money!,1,40,9/8/2014,"I heard quite a lot about this restaurant and always wanted to try it but didn't have the chance until very recently.Yum Cha, literally means, 'Drink Tea' in Chinese also means to having Chinese tea and dim sum. Dim Sum, small Chinese dishes. Think of it like servings of individual bites, in small portions.The location of the restaurant, in the middle of Singapore's Chinatown, adds to the allure of this place.The Dim Sum were had are surprisingly good, the portions just nice. Yum Cha does not skim on the ingredients and we could find whole pieces of shrimps, for example, in our Har Kow (Prawn Dumplings) and Prawn Chee Cheong Fun (Steamed Prawns in Rice Rolls). The fried carrot cake was very crispy and still soft to bite. Overall, I like the food and the price.However, the only dish I find not well done was the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun which I felt had too much oil and not enough of the light soy sauce.It is a very popular restaurant and do expect to queue for a while if you are going during the busy times of lunch and dinner."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good service and delicious food,1,50,9/1/2014,"You can tell a good restaurant when it is used by locals and this one was packed. We didn't have to wait too long and it was well worth the wait, food was delicious and the sweet and sour fish was excellent. The staff work hard and are polite and served the dishes without delay. A good place to eat."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum just a block from Chinatown MRT,1,40,08/20/14,"I was recommended this from a friend, it's near the Santa Ana Grande hotel. Went around 9:30am on a Sunday morning.Meal wasn't overly expensive, and lots to choose from: either hot or cold options. Custard bun was good but be careful or it can pop open and you'll have custard sauce all over the table (or you!). Try a little of a few things and you can order more of the same if you like it. Good service, rarely have to wait long for them to come around again. It wasn't overly crowded yet so that was helpful.Depending on which direction you come from, it can be difficult to find the entrance, and you have to take stairs or elevator to 2nd floor to the restaurant."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great Dumplings!!! ,1,40,08/17/14,"I got this restaurant recommended by a local friend and went twice during a one week visit to Singapore. Yum Cha Restaurant is located in the heart of China Town. Both times I had a great dining experience, but I must say I enjoyed the second most, as it had a different set-up. First time I visited the restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon and we were served from a menu. The second time I visited it on a Saturday during lunch time and servers were passing by pushing trolleys with different dumpling you could choose from. Loved the fact you could actually see how the dumpling look like before choosing. The restaurant was both times packed with locals and expect to wait for a table, specially during lunch time. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent Sunday Dimsum,1,40,08/15/14,Get there early and great for a Sunday lunch. It is queue and wait and well worth the effort. Reasonably priced for good dim sum and sufficient through put of people not to be stale.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good selections of Dim Sum..,1,40,8/2/2014,Went there to try their Dim Sum Buffet after spend the morning at River Safari.. Was overwhelmed by the variety of delicious dim sums and we enjoyed it.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Overpriced,1,40,7/5/2014,"I went to Yum Cha with friends while visiting Singapore at the end of June. The dim sum was good but I have had better, and overpriced for what it was. It was nice to see the place filled with locals, and our service was good. This place seems to be highly recommended to tourists but I believe there is better dim sum to be had in Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Get Food,1,40,06/30/14,Enjoyed this restaurant as we went there on a tour then returned on our own. It was good value and the kids loved it
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best dumplings ever!,1,50,06/27/14,"Filled with locals and has a great atmosphere, service was great and the food was fantastic, definitely recommend getting the first dumplings on the menu. A must to dine in singapore!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,thrilling.,1,40,06/24/14,"Nice place, quite hard to find, lost in the middle of the shops. But very goog food, decent and precise service. The dim sums are creative and awake curiosity and awoke my tatse buds very nicely. Spice is present but not invading."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Such good food!,1,50,6/7/2014,"Whilst I had been warned that the service could be inconsistent but the food would be very tasty, I was disappointed on one front - the service. Both the food and the service were of the highest quality on the day we visited. Highly recommend you go early though!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Excellent, fresh, authentic",1,50,05/29/14,"The food was some of the best Chinese food I have had. Located in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha handled our large group very well. The food came out hot and was clearly well prepared. It tasted fresh and was nicely spiced. They were sensitive to folks' allergies and food preferences."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Always excellent value for money,1,40,05/27/14,"In the middle of Chinatown Singapore, up an old staircase is still one of the best Yum Cha/dim sum restaurants in town. I have no hesitation in taking visitors here and going there myself for my favourites. In a town where prices are going through the roof, this is great value for money. Nice mix of shoppers, tourists and locals."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Why spoil it with silly add on charges,1,40,04/21/14,"Really nice, freshly cooked dim sum in authentic surroundings. No complaints, we visit here once or twice each year and it's consistently good but why oh why do they add on for a tiny bowl of peanuts on the table and for the service totes, 2.00 peanuts and 60 cents for each serviette. No big deal just silly. In addition to the dim sum menu we always ask for a bowl of plain rice which is great value at 1 dollar so we shall continue to visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very 'Yum'!,1,40,03/29/14,"Just had a Saturday lunch here with my son, his partner and my grand daughter and we all enjoyed the food.Trollies full of delicious steaming dim sum calling at our table every few minutes and it was a mighty effort demolishing the food fast enough so we could order refills!Good family atmosphere here and heaving with all sorts of people, the staff certainly weren't unfriendly, just extremely busy.The restaurant is situated at 20 Trengganu St in Chinatown amidst many other Chinese restaurants and a very short walk from Chinatown MRT.We ate plenty at the bill came to 72 Singapore Dollars."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum is delicious,1,40,03/14/14,Yum Cha Restaurant is on 2Floor in Santa Grand Hotel China Town. Dim Sum and congee is delicious but this restaurant don't have English menu.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dimsum,1,40,02/23/14,"Situated along Trengganu Street, it is around 5min walk from Chinatown MRT. Used to be quite small, it has now expanded so it was crowded (cos food was nice). It now seems to be partner of a hotel (same lift as Santa Grand Hotel). Service was not that great but that's to be expected. Dimsum was fresh and tasted good. Typical steamed ones would be around SGD4 (eg a basket of 4 siew mai/prawn dumpling SGD3.80; Lo Mai Kai SGD3.80). They have several types of chinese tea.Overall, very nice food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Good, but not great",1,40,01/14/14,"Solid Dim Sum place in Singapore. Not the best dim sum I've ever eaten in my life, quite good nevertheless. If you're a fan, you'd probably like it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tea quality is not good enough. Some dishes are pretty high in price.,1,40,1/11/2014,"I liked the big selection of different snacks that you can choose from. I disliked the tea they served. I expect better quality tea leaves in a ""Yum Cha Place"". After all, the authentic Yum Cha is having ""tea drinking"" as the core of the enjoyment, supported by snacks of different kinds. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good dimsum in Chinatown,1,40,12/31/13,"There are several dim sum restaurants in Chinatown - this one stands out for several reasons.1. Ambience is the best of the lot, with the look and feel of a classy Chinese restaurant.2. It attracts the most tourists. Expect long queues during peak hours esp. Weekends.Dim sum is generally good - standout dishes being the fried glutinous rice, custard dumpling and steamed beef balls.Prices have been steadily increasing and a dim sum meal for two should be about $40-$50 now.Service can be compromised on peak days with urgency to clear the queue as quickly as possible."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,The best Dim Sum in Chinatown,1,40,12/13/13,It is great this restaurant. The dim sum is delicious. After 3:00pm they have open buffet with a lot of different choices. The decoration is very nice and cozy.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious Chinese dinner,1,50,12/4/2013,We took Roasted duck for four persons here and we love it much. they made us full after order a lot of foods. Good taste.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Terrific dim sum - great location,1,40,11/22/13,This is one of my favorite places for a weekend breakfast of dim sum. I highly recommend you go early (9ish) because the place fills up quickly. The quality of their dim sum is great. The staff are always hustling around to bring the food to the diners. Don't be shy or you'll miss an opportunity for your fave dim sum to go to another diner!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great atmosphere and food,1,40,11/21/13,Yum cha in Chinatown is a must and we stumbled on this restaurant. The entrance can be a bit tricky to find but people will point the way. It was Sunday so very busy and the waitress helped by bringing dishes we pointed to in the menu to our table (although it's more fun to choose from the trolley especially if you have no idea what it is). Some of the dishes are pretty standard but we had a few exceptional ones as well eg the crab and five treasures soup. It was a little pricey as we got stung for extras on the table (peanuts) and we think a ten dollar surcharge. But it was fun.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Nice food but...,1,40,11/10/2013,"Good variety of authentic Chinese yum cha
I went there with a friend
The only problem is that is a little bit disorganized service
Expect to wait to be seated for approx 15-20 min"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great fresh food,1,40,11/10/2013,Don't really need to say anything else except ......don't miss eating here when in Singapore. The food is fantastic.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dimsum heaven!,1,50,11/4/2013,"We went on a busy Saturday lunch, hence, the relatively long wait. But it was worth the wait.Trolley and trolley of food will pass by your table and It can be intimidating to the uninitiated.Clueless about what to order, just point and ask, and the staff will answer the best they can. Surprise yourself and randomly choose what ever fancies your eye. If you have food allergies, make sure to ask whats inside as there are a number of food with shrimps and crab meat. And, yes, do try the peking duck (if available)."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Definitely the best Dim Sum in Singapore,1,40,11/2/2013,"Loved the variety of dim sum available. The menu is in Chinese so did not really know what to order. But they bring the dim sum in a trolley and you can pick whatever looks good. It did match the great dim sum I had in Shenzhen (China) some time back. Very authentic. It is not really a fancy restaurant, but gives you a feel of how food is enjoyed in China."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,1,50,10/26/13,"My GF and I had the lunchtime all you can eat Dim Sum, they have a great trolley (several in fact) and also a la carte, you can pick and choose from both.Staff were very friendly constantly bringing more dishes.Best Dim Sum I've had, including places in China and London!It's tucked away upstairs but quite easy to find.."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Hard to find, easy to enjoy",1,50,10/23/13,Look behind the stalls for the small sign and stairs leading up to Yum Cha. It is better than anything else in the neighborhood. We had the Dim Sum and were very pleased with the quality and quantity. As we sat there we could see other full dinner platters pass by to tables in other rooms that were having full meals. They looked wonderful. Except for the beer the prices were very good. Plan on just one beer or none at all. The tea is a very good alternative both for quality and price.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Tasty pepper crab,1,40,10/9/2013,"The food is somewhat better than the other chinese places, I've been to. Nice pepper crab, tasty tofu and shiitake... No great lover of chinese food, but this was ok. Service is acceptable, but by no means accomodating. Entrance is in the bach of a store. Look out!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Superb!!,1,50,09/16/13,"This was a superb experience in China Town. Look on google maps for location, and its upstairs in a little hotel. There was a fast moving queue, as this place is really popular with the locals. The food was absolutely delicious, and all freshly prepared. Once seated, the ladies come around with a trolley loaded with baskets of dim sum……just choose what you want to eat - get a mixture of baskets. I would avoid the spinach with garlic, as it was a plate of stalks……..they said it didn't come with leaves!!! Ummm!! But all in all, don't go to China Town without paying this little diamond a visit."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Nice food, quite authentic environment, value for money",1,40,8/9/2013,"Located in the 2nd floor of this shop house in Chinatown, it's one of the traditional style of dim sum service - push carts, a nice touch.Food is very good - everything from Siew Mai, Har Gow, Char Siew Pow, Lo Mai Kai.I personally felt the porridge was average.Try the crav meat soup dumpling, around sgd6.80 per bowl, really nice."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Old style dumpling service with carts on wooden floor, very nice",1,40,8/3/2013,"The Xiao long bao is Excellent, you need to ask for it as it does not make it on to the carts. The dumplings are uniformly very good."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Reasonably Priced Buffet,1,40,07/31/13,"The dim sum buffet offers good value and selection. The quality was above average as compared to other dim sum outlets out there.Service wasn't the best but I've experienced worse. They do seem short of staff during peak hours, hence, the slower service.As for comments on being charged for napkins, tea and peanuts, from my experience, it seems like a fairly normal practice here for Chinese restaurants. You can opt not to have the peanuts and napkins by returning them if you do not want to pay for them."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good place.. Good food,1,40,06/29/13,Visited last may.. We had a great experience.. Recommended place.. I enjoy the food enjoy also the ambience... I hope I can visit this place again in the future
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,cheap and good,1,40,5/6/2013,cheap and good. location is very close to the hotel.china town was very fun. but some people do not understand even English. i thought is this Singapore
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha - Nice Dim Sum,1,50,04/18/13,I like the dishes here coz they are delicious and affordable. Like the push carts ladies selling their wares.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Amazing Dim Sum,1,50,4/11/2013,"This appealing second floor place in Chinatown serves the best dim sum anywhere we have been, including home-base NY, Hong Kong, Hawaii, etc.Everything is cooked to order, as opposed to the cute roving carts often seen. You order yourself, guided by the list which has many photos of items. Wonderful flavors and combination of ingredients such as snow peal leaf/prawn dumplings, prawn asparagus dumplings and many more. Service is efficient if not personable. Ice cold Tiger draught.This is a ""must try"" aNd definitely worth returning to if you have the time."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim sum craze!,1,50,03/30/13,"I loved this place. The more the merrier! Not the most straight forward way to find the entrance, but clear enough. Once up on the 2nd Floor, you get welcomed by... people queuing! But do not give up, because the turn-over rate is factory-like and you will be seated in no time. I think I waited 10 or 15 min once, but it is worth it! A woman cruise by to note down how many of you will be eating (that's how the queue never stays long enough for you to complain, usually). You get to your table and get served straight away some Jasmine tea, and then either trollies or waitresses zig-zag between tables to present you their freshly steamed or fried dishes. The waitresses then tick the boxes on the receipt that lives on the table. Generally you will end up with a USD 20 note per person, and that is for a full belly! I only tried the Dim Sum and other buns, but it had became my Sunday ritual and I recommend it to whoever stops in Singapore long enough to visit this restaurant.Ho, and please try the mango Sago. It's a liquid mango dish with clear rice beads, and it is soooo refreshing. Do get rebutted by its appearance, and try it!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very large restaurant and good menu and yum cha all day and night.,1,40,03/24/13,Very good hrs to do yum cha. Food very good and prices very good. Up on the 1st floor off Temple St. We were given a good recomendation by a local to this restaurant.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food - good prices,1,50,03/24/13,"We were recommended this restaurant - went for yum cha, steamed dumplings were great, Peking duck pancakes yummy and fried prawn wontons great. Spring rolls only average. Friendly service and a mix of local and western customers. 6 dishes, peanuts and 3 soft drinks cost $S36. Would definately return"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yummy Xiaolongba,1,40,03/19/13,"We have been here a few times now, and have even taken visiting guest here. The dim sum is very good the Xiaolongba are very tasty, as the is the deep fried banana and red bean and the mango pudding. Service is a bit slow though, but we think its worth it."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Divine food.... A couple of staff need to learn to smile,1,50,01/27/13,"An awesome array of yum cha, each one of which was melt in your mouth, from the ink squid dumpling to the mango and prawn roll with sesame, the treasure soup....expertly and accurately appeared on our table. Loved how they were served in the order we had ticked them on the menu so we knew exactly what we were eating. We would have loved to return, but the crowds preparing for Chinese New Year prevented us from reaching it again. BTW there is now a lift as well as the wooden staircase that used to be the only entry.we were lucky not to have to wait when we arrived......there was a huge queue as we left. Only criticism is the two staff who were a little grumpy and need to learn how to smile"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Chinatown Restaurant,1,40,01/27/13,"I wrote in my book, BBQ Port Bun - OMG! Perfectly cooked garlic softshell crab. Pan fried pork pancake, really good, fragrant, not like pancake we think of in the states! Great energy at this restaurant. Not supergreat customer service but I would go back."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,First-Class Hai Huang Yi Pin Porridge,1,40,1/1/2013,An appetizing light well-seasoned luscious porridge with a delightful aroma which gratify one's gustatory sense
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE,1,40,12/21/12,"We went to this Restarant in a group of about 100 people. It's obviously a very popular Restaurant for Tourists and locals alike, because there was lots of people waiting to get in. Aside from that the food and service is very good. Their speciality is Dim Sum served in typical Cantonese style. We had a fixed menu and all the dishes was very tasty if you like that type of food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,One of the few old places left,1,40,12/6/2012,"Yum Cha is a great original Dim Sum restaurant with the old trolley System, serving great assortment of Dim Sumcharging for the extras is typical in Singapore bring yourOwn napkins,,,Lobster is expensive in Singapore food is expensive period.The food is great and the Staff helpfulCome with a good attitude and you walk home with a great experience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Authentic dim sum in Chinatown - just get there early,1,40,11/25/12,Despite the reviews about grumpy staff we were pleasantly surprised and had an enjoyable lunch. Good selection of average quality dim sum in a great location if you're in China town. Staff were helpful and responsive. Get there early to avoid the long queues.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"good food, friendly people",1,40,11/18/12,the food quality not so bad..tasty too but the dessert still not as good as the one i had at canton-I :) very friendly and helpful people..
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Old school Dim Sum,1,40,11/16/12,Quaint and simple with push-carts and noisy environmnt. But food tastes good and good for an informal lunch or tea with friends.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very yummy!,1,50,11/13/12,"I am a local and this is my 2nd visit. The pushcart dim sum is fantastic and I actually prefer this style to ordering, as u can see the exact dish and decide whether you want it.The food is great and inexpensive.I'm surprised that other reviewers commented about the bad service? They are mostly Chinese aunties who were quick and efficient in handing dishes to us. Maybe they don't smile too much and describe the dishes in detail, but that's because they can't speak much English and I don't fault them at all. :) Don't expect 5 star hotel service because that's not what this place is about. It's fantastic for its food, efficiency and atmosphere. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Would have got ten out of ten, but staff were glum",1,40,10/30/12,"Terrific classic yum cha food. It was full of flavour, generous servings of prawns, yummy slippery and crispy coatings on tasty fillings. Servings were attractive.It was inexpensive, quick and has a very pleasant ambience, apart from the somewhat glum waitrons.Sited in an old shop house, up a flight of lovely teak stairs, it is in the middle of the bustling and crazy night market. Certainly the place to visit in Chinatown. Loved the food."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum on trolleys,1,40,10/27/12,"Fabulous authentic dim sum delivered by waitresses pushing choosing trolleys . Excellent value great choices friendly efficient staff. We were upstairs and it was busy at midday on Saturday. Chinese tea and beer, plenty of dim sum 5 eating 80 dollars. Hope we shall go again"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Lots of interesting dim sum stuff,1,50,10/26/12,"Very good value, full juicy dim sum pieces, innovative too. Love the banana red bean fritter. Also love the various prawn-based dumplings and the noodles are good. I also always use their delivery service. Good food!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good but very noisy,1,40,10/9/2012,"The food was good. Service so so only. However the atmosphere wasn't good as it was like a market, simply too noisy. It is always with long queue and if you really want to go, remember to make reservation one or two days in advance. And reservation is very strict, cannot be late. Suggest to let customers fill up the menu slip on what they want to eat rather than pushing the carts around because the restaruant itself is not spacious enough. The restaurant sign board is not easily seen along the road. If you are driving, the parking is not cheap, $1 per half an hour."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good Dim Sum,1,40,09/29/12,"Nice Chinese restaurant.
They have good dim sum, chilli crab even. Best thing is they have delivery service."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Delicious!,1,50,09/28/12,"Recommended by a local and we were not disappointed. Very good, fresh dim sum - very speedy service, lots of locals which is always a good sign and delicious food so perfect for a tourist who wants good food at a reasonble priced without having to spend hours waiting around. Would definately go back!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for Yum Cha!!,1,50,09/28/12,"Located just of Temple St, this restaurant is always busy with locals and those tourists lucky enough to know about it. During peak times there can be a line up to get in but they turn over the tables quite quickly so usually the wait is not bad. They provide an excellent menu with pictures of each dish, so can order off the menu or wait for the trolley to come around and take what is there..Food is excellent quality, staff are efficient and service is fast.Will always visit when going to Singapore!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Most relished dim sums,1,40,09/27/12,"This place lives upto its name - awesome dim sums and you will be spoilt for choice. the menu is very friendly, it has images of each of the dish.
Dessert recommendation - Egg Tarts."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Not bad but poor service,1,40,09/25/12,"I tried the weekday tea buffet which was good value because you can order as much as you want. Food was pretty good, there were plenty of steamed and fried dumplings and other dishes you can order as well. Prices have increased from last time and they did take out some dishes (eg. sweet and sour pork) that used to be there before. Service is poor - almost all the waiters there speak mostly chinese and they give you attitude as and when they feel like it. Ordering from them is hard and requesting simple things like water can be a challenge. The waiters/waitresses there never smile and are impatient when taking orders or answering questions. Food that we ordered did take quite sometime to come so be prepared to wait if you don't want to fill up quickly on the fried dumplings they repeatedly serve you on a cart that they go around with. The century egg porridge was a big disappointment because there was about 1/4 century egg inside the porridge. We liked the desserts - mango pudding, egg tarts and red bean pancake. It can be very crowded and noisy, especially on weekends."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent dim sum and very good value,1,50,09/23/12,"I always bring visitors to Yum Cha for the experience and of course the food. The service is usually average to poor, its incredibly noisy at lunchtime at the weekend and you usually have to queue for a table.However it is all worth it for the food. Excellent dim sum, great flavors and incredible value for money. Can't say its a relaxed experience but definitely a 'must' if you are visiting Singapore."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good food for an inexpensive meal,1,40,09/18/12,Food is very good and good variety of choices for dim sum. Very busy during lunch though. Breakfast and tea time is better
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Better atmosphere on the week end,1,40,09/17/12,"Nice chinese restaurant with good food, lot of chinese people come during the week end with their family all the generation together, the old women serve you, kids like so much !"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Fun, slight chaotic but enjoyable",1,40,9/4/2012,"Being from out of town the concierge recommended Yum Cha for Dim Sum. If you are looking for a quite, intimate meal, Yum Cha is not the place for you. Of course there was a line and once you got in you got a feel for the rhythm and the controlled chaos. I had so much fun picking and choosing what to eat and asking for recommendations from the staff. I was not disappointed and all the flavors were new a enjoyable."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Excellent service!,1,50,08/30/12,"I ordered Yum Cha delivery today for my colleagues and wow I am so impressed! We ordered Set A and 3 other ala carte items for 12 adults. What impressed me, besides the delicious food, was their thoughtfulness and attention to little details! The delivery man carried all the food to the allocated place, which required him to climb up the stairs. Then, he took out a disposable table cloth and started laying all the food. I offered to help but he kindly declined, saying it is part of his job. What impressed me further was the fact that my delivery came with disposable cutlery that was catered for more then 20 adults and even had several garbage bags! Wow, I am really impressed! Each of us paid $11 for this delivery and we definitely agree that the portions could feed another 3 adults for sure! Thumbs UP for Yum Cha! You are a gem!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great dim sum,1,50,08/16/12,Every time I'm in Singapore I go at least twice to this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Dim sum is fantastic (reasonable prices) and the lobster noodles are over the top (but expensive). My favorite is steam dim sum but I have to say that the deep fried mango and prawns rolls are great. I suggest to drink chinese tea with dim sum and here the chinese jasmine tea is excellent quality. At the weekends you don't have to order from the menu because you can choose directly from the trolley passing by the tables.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Cha,1,40,8/9/2012,"Last weekend, I took some Australians friends to Yum Cha for breakfast. Out of the 15 reviews for this year, half have four and five stars. My friends enjoyed the food, the dim sums are fresh (especially those with prawns), and I findthe service greatly improved from my last visit. The moment I flipped over the cover of the tea pot (meaning that they should refill the pot) someone quickly took the pot away and came back with a fresh pot of tea. We left behind one small pau, but one of the elderly waitress saw this and insisted we should not waste and she went to put it in a small bag for us. I will visit again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,yummy in my tummy,1,50,8/3/2012,"dim sum is one of those things that can either be wonderful or tatseless , yum cha has a menu of plenty options and wonderous things to chose from me and my partner have fallen in love with dim sum ever since i came back from hong kong and introduced him to it , anything steamed IS GOOOOOOD!!! yum cha is always busy but always easy to get a seat never waiting more then 5 mins .its cheap cheerful and right in the middle of chintowns markets , a little hard to find at first but just ask a local and they will point u in the right direction ..enjoy it ! and tell me alllll about it"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Yumcha I have had!,1,40,07/29/12,This is a feast not for the faint hearted. The pork buns are truly amazing! The sauce they use is so tasty. The service was lacking but lets be honest its all about the food! 3-5pm they do cheap Yumcha and we wish we had more time to go back again!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Kinda basic, but the food is great!",1,40,06/20/12,"My husband and I have been to Yum Cha a couple of times now, once in 2010 and once just last month. It's a fairly decent restaurant, slightly hidden away if you don't know where it is - the restaurant is kinda sparse, hence my 'basic' title .. there are no fancy frills here! The staff are ok, I mean they do their job and serve you quickly, but it's a place for striking up conversation or having a joke with the staff .. it's just about serving (which is fine, though can sometimes come across a little unfriendly). The food however is amazing! We love the dim sum, congee, and there are these amazing prawn and mango rolls which are just incredible! In 2010 we also had some kind of deep fried prawns hung over the side of a half carved out pineapple - we couldn't get that this time but they do still serve it, and it's delicious! Even though the service/decor is pretty ordinary, the food is amazing, and it's a perfect spot to go for lunch or dinner after spending the day in Chinatown. We'll always go back!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Chinese New Year dim sum,1,40,05/20/12,"We were able to get a last minute seating on Chinese New Year. We only waited about 10 minutes. Pretty decent dim sum where there are ladies with carts and well as being able to order off the menu. All the basic choices available included hakaw, shumai, egg custard pies, lo mi kai, cha siew boa, etc. Not the best dim sum I've had (in LA:)) but definitely quality. "
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Best Dim Sum in Chinatown!,1,50,04/29/12,Great place to get Dim Sum right in the heart of Chinatown!
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good old Yum Cha charm,1,40,4/7/2012,"We took the High Tea Buffet Promotion - $21.80++ for adults and $16.80++ for children 3pm-6pm (Last order at 5.30pm).Even thou it's a weekday we got a shock when we enter as there's a huge crowd; we manage to get a table along the restaurant pathway (which is a good choice). :)We were presented with a menu (which is a A4 size red colour paper), a total of 67 items were listed. There's 5 categories: Steam Dim Sum, Fried Dim Sum ,Rice,Rice Roll & Congee, Side Dishes & Dessert.The waitress will be pushing a cart around with all the Steam/Fried Dim Sum & Side Dishes, just tell her what u want or u could simply point at the dishes (if u not sure what's the dish name, like us) and it will be put onto yr table. Or u could order from the menu, dish name is in English & Chinese.We were so overwhelm be the variety of Dim Sum available that we just keep pointing and ended up with a table cover full of food! The Dim Sum were pipping hot & fresh, personally I like the steam stuff better as I found the fried Dim Sum a tad too oily.I would advise to get yr hand on the baked mini egg tarts & coconut tarts half way though yr meal and not wait till last as they run out pretty fast, it's really delicious.A good way to end the meal with the lemongrass jelly with fruits, the slight tangy favor of lemongrass is refreshing after a full meal.It's a nice place to have a meal and play catch-up with friend or family member. Just don't seat too far away from the pathway, cos at times it's had to catch the attention of the waitress & the push cart may not be able to go near yr table."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Fantastic Food and Service,1,50,3/7/2012,"Was a little put off by some of the reviews but we found this restaurant fantastic. Couldnt fault the food or the service.We had the afternoon tea (buffet all you can eat). They came around with push-carts and the manager was very attentive. We asked for a particular dish that didnt seem to be on any of the carts and after about 5 mins a lady brought us a plate to the table... they had made the dish especially for us and you could tell how fresh all the dishes tasted.We did seem to be the only Westeners there, but doesnt that say its good, eat where the locals eat is our motto.Much smaller than Maxim's in Hong Kong but just as good we thought."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great food,1,50,3/2/2012,"This restaurant has very good dim sum, great menu, and good service, always busy."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,"Delicious Dim Sum, although dear.",1,40,02/19/12,"I've visited Yum Cha several times with my family, and always had fine meals. This is something of an accomplishment, given the surly disposition of the management and the unhelpful wait-staff (many of whom don't speak English). The challenge is to secure the items one intends; photos of many varieties of dim sum in the menu are of considerable help.You're going to spend a good deal of money to satisfy a healthy appetite, but the quality of the flavors you'll experience may well dull the pain in your wallet! Stated simply: Yum Cha does dim sum right!"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Definitely the place for Dim Sum when you are in Chinatown,1,50,01/21/12,"I found there was a lot of improvement compared to the last time that we visited 2 years ago.Everything is good, our bill came to $60 and the both of us really enjoy it.The service is good, maybe because I can able to speak Mandarin to the ladies."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,dim sum at is best,1,50,1/8/2012,"This is a dim sum heaven in the heart of Chinatown, during weekdays you have to order from the menu but during weekend waiters pass by from table to table with trolleys packed with bamboo buckets full of dim sum delicacies. A must try in Singapore and don't forget to eat your dim sum drinking only water and chinese tea for a very far east experience"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,If you are visiting Chinatown do stop and have some traditional dim sum,1,40,11/10/2011,Excellent dim sum and traditional Chinese food at affordable prices in the heart of Chinatown. The wine is expensive and only sold by the bottle so stick to tea. Delicious food can't wait to go back.
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Yum Chow!,1,50,10/22/11,"we liked their crabs , shrimps..everything!!! the staff were also helpful in keeping my son's birthday cake while we wearing still having dinner"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Very affordable and delicious dim sum,1,40,09/13/11,"Nestled in the heart of the Chinatown district, Yum Cha offers a delectable array of authentic Chinese cuisine. During a short vacation, a friend who lives in Singapore highly recommended this place. Me and my friend's family went here for some dim sum feast and we were not disappointed. The dim sums were great and we enjoyed every bite of what we ordered. I especially loved their siew mai, che cheong fun and xiao long fun. Restaurant ambiance was acceptable and the staff were accommodating."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Good value for authentic Dim Sum,1,40,9/5/2011,"We had lunch here on our second day in Singapore and it was a great experience - very authentic dishes for Dim Sum. The service is perhaps not as good as the food, but this tends to be the case in most Dim Sum restaurants.Best to arrive earlier on Sundays, to avoid the long wait at the entrance."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Affordable Dim Sum in a pretty oriental ambience,1,50,08/28/11,"Visited there with my husband and daughter for lunch on Sunday afternoon. Although the restraunt was crowded and were so many people waiting, we were so lucky to get the seat soon because we were only three people, while the others were large parties. We seated at a table beside window with a pretty view of lanterns, but the window itself adds a oriental spice to the room. Of course the food were good: as were shown in the pictures, they look nice as well. We rushed to Pekin Duck, and had nine dim sum and oolong tea. What surprised us was that the total price was 56 Singapore dollars!!! Definitely visit there again."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,A favourite place.,1,40,06/17/11,"Well, despite the place being busy and often a bit noisy we always enjoy this place when we go to Sing. The Dim Sum are good ,at times very good. with a wide choice. If you arent getting what you want then try a bit harder and be nice to the staff, they a generally rushed off their feet. Ordering rather than waiting for trolleys ensures you get served The main i.e. non dim sum menu is fine and the food is goood. Bargain dealls for early morning and afternoon. The best DS place in Sing, or KL for that matter."
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Dim Sum Buffet a good way to experiment.,1,40,03/17/09,"Dim Sum @ Yum ChaHad a desire for some nice Dim Sum. Followed a recommendation and headed into the heart of China Town. A little hard to find, hidden away in the back streets between Smith and Temple Street, above a perfume shop.Had the DimSum Buffet at SD16.80++ per person. If you arent sure what you like, or want to try lots of different things, its a great idea. The waitresses bring round and offer you a variety of plates by hand or in a trolley, and you say yes or no. Because you pay a fixed price, it means you can try some new things without worrying about wasting money.Tip: the menu has a few categories of things that you order from your server, the rest is pot luck what is brought round. However, we found that if there was something on the general menu we particularly wanted, our server was happy to order it for us anyway.Left feeling very stuffed, and having tried some interesting things. We appeared to be the only non locals there, but that wasnt a problem in any way.(http://www.yumcha.com.sg/Contact.html)"
Chinese,Yum Cha Restaurant,Great place for value-for-money dim sum high tea on weekdays.,1,40,06/26/08,Great place for value-for-money dim sum high tea on weekdays.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Crab!,1,50,07/16/18,"I'm told this is the home of the original Chili Crab. Not sure if that's true, but it is delicious! The Black pepper crab is also great!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood,1,40,07/14/18,"Food is consistently well executed here. Black pepper crab is always a favourite - it’s not overly peppery and the crabs are always cooked well. The razor clams were delicious though it doesn’t come cheap. The sweet chilli crab is not the best for me as it has a strong tomato taste but others seems to enjoy that.Service wise, it always seems slightly haphazard."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very much one for the Locals but still a great experience for the ""out-of-Towners""",1,40,7/12/2018,"Visited with a colleague who lives locally and was excited to see whether Long Beach at Dempsey was as good as their Restaurant on the East Coast Parkway Seafood Centre. I was not disappointed. The house special shell-off prawns were excellent, as was the black pepper crab. All in all, a very enjoyable evening at an incredibly busy restaurant. Efficient service and really good value."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food Good service!,1,50,7/10/2018,I had a welcome dinner here with my company. The food was great. I really like the cereal prawn and bamboo clam. You better go there before 7 p.m. otherwise long q
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent service,1,40,06/30/18,"We had friends from the US, and brought them here for dinner. The chilli and black pepper crabs were quite good. We also ordered vegetarian fried bee hoon for one of their children who does not eat meat, as well as mee goreng, calamari, fried baby squid, and spinach with three eggs. All the dishes were generally tasty, though prices were pretty high as well.But it was the service that wowed us. As we had three children below 10 years dining in the group, the staff helped to deshell the black pepper crab. When one of the kids threw up, staff Lynn preferred some oil for her stomach, as well as extra plastic bags in case she threw up in the vehicle. Overall, the meal was good, and cost $400."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Black Pepper Crab but Mediocre Service,1,40,06/18/18,"We had a reservation and were seated quickly as requested outside. The setting of the restaurant is always beautiful in the evening. The food was excellent but the service was really not so good this time. Food came quickly but water refills, getting the bill, paying the bill etc was slow and cumbersome. We will return but hope the site management will address the service. Our previous visit was a 5 star.... and this had the potential to be as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Service was as good as the crab.,1,50,6/8/2018,"Amazing service from when you first step into the restaurant. It's very busy so make reservations. We ordered the set menu for 2 that included crab AND razor clams (and more) for $168 SGD. The razor clams were fresh and garlicky, the crab was perfectly peppery and delicious. I would come back for sure."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wonderful Staff and Food,1,40,6/6/2018,"Visited on a lunch time so the place wasn’t as busy! The manager and staff were wonderful! Great service! The food is also very Good! Chilli crab, razor clams and roast duck are all superb! The price is quite expensive but we can’t complain as the quality of food is really very high! It’s worth making a trip to Dempsey! Even with the abundance of choices it’s still worth choosing over the other Restaurants. Looking forward to going back soon."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chili Crab in town,1,50,6/1/2018,It’s always my 1st choice for chili crabs for my VIP guests and family dinner. Food are delicious and price is reasonable.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Singapore Crab,1,40,05/21/18,"Prepare to get messy!The crab is to die for, but you must eat by hand and thus endure some greasy hands. It is all worth it though!The sides are good s well, but the real attraction for sure is their crabs. The service is so and so, but very cozy and the laid back attitude actually seems to fit the place quite well and therefore is actually just right. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wow!!!!,1,50,05/18/18,"Long Beach was phenomenal. We had pepper crab, chili crab, shrimp, sea bass and scallops. Each were fantastic!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty Chilli Crab,1,50,04/26/18,"If you don’t make it out to East Coast then Long Beach restaurant in the Dempsey area is a great place to get your fix of chilli crabs. Best to book in advance, the place gets very busy. Last order is 12:30am every evening."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great crab and superb service. ,1,50,04/23/18,"Went one night for the famous chilli and black pepper crabs which didn’t disappoint, in fact all the food we had was fresh and tasted great. Beautiful House Speciality Prawns, the freshest buns (I could have eaten them all) with the crab, crunchy vegetables and perfectly cooked rice. I also want to pay particular homage to Lynn our waitress, she made our night, so special, we will never forget you Lynn! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious black pepper & chilli crabs!,1,50,4/6/2018,"What a fantastic experience! Loved each and every single item. Absolutely succulent black pepper and chili crabs! It was just perfect! The fried calsmari, garlic prawns and the oh so delicious fried buns were just out of this world. Quick customer service. Price on the higher end which is definitely worth it. Its a clean and chilled out environment. Just one observation- charging for the napkins was a little cheap i thought. But its their place. So didnt care. Definitely going back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab,1,40,03/24/18,"Come here everytime for its black pepper crab. I notice most other ppl ordered the chili crab, but for me black pepper is preferable. Place is always crowded, even on monday night. Reservation is a must if u want to sit indoors. Not a suitable place for dates imho"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ideal for guests ,1,40,03/16/18,"Good seafood, view and environment. Ideal place if you have guests especially from abroad to try out Singapore black pepper crab. The service here is excellent, very attentive to customers.

Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Went for a birthday celebration. The staff made it a memorable celebration!,1,50,3/4/2018,Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday. The food was great as always. Love the pepper crab. The service was amazing. They came out made my sister wear a tiara and sang happy birthday as we were cutting the cake. The whole restaurant began singing along too. Amazing experience
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent value for money,1,50,02/21/18,"Long Beach Dempsey is a wonderful restaurant, and it’s very accessible. The food is fantastic, and given that some Singapore restaurants can be expensive, I think this is moderately priced relative to the quality and service they deliver. I’ll be going back on my next visit to Singapore. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fantastic experience with Razor Clams, Black Pepper Crab and Sea Bass Penang style",1,50,02/20/18,"I can't say we are easily impressed with food, but today the food was wonderful, different flavors, spicy, but not too spicy, and very well seasoned. The Black Pepper Crab (S$ 71) is what they are known for and for a good reason, but the razor clams (S$ 16/each) were excellent, as was the Sea Bass Penang style (S$ 41)! Also the fried rice with dried scollops (S$ 18) was light and very good texture. Even the Spinach with Oyster Sauce (S$ 18) was very tasty. Of course a glass of Tiger draft (S$ 6.90) helped to cool the spice :).When eating the Black Pepper Crab, ask for gloves and a pick, as well as a bib to keep from splattering on your clothes! It comes out piping hot.Service was very good, and afterward we asked for a cab, which they called for, and it was here in less than 5 minutes.Definitely, for first timers to Singapore, and most experience dinner."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy CNY set menu,1,50,2/12/2018,"I normally am not a fan of set menu as I like to mix and match my own. I can’t tonight because it is their busiest time of the year hence everyone has to choose a set of dinner from their menu. We chose the SGD348+++ menu and I must say surprisingly we all enjoy our meal very much!!! The food is fresh, well cooked and simply delicious. The dessert is fantastic, grapefruit coconut pudding with fresh mango. Their service despite a full house is impeccable. They change our plate after serving one dish and keep checking on us if we need anything. We will definitely go back again. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very good food,1,40,01/31/18,"The restaurant is not fancy in terms of look, as it is quite simple and not super cosy.Nevertheless the welcome and service is really nice, waiters and waitress are taking care of their customers with attention.The food was delicious, we had sevr’earl plates to share and all of them were tasty. Super fresh seafood, you can trust the place! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,1,50,01/23/18,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private rooms and plenty of seats for outside dining . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always good,1,40,01/13/18,"It was the second time in a week we decided to go for chilli and pepper crab. We went to Holy Crab in Bugis area and was disappointed. Maybe it’s because we always wanted the original taste. So this time, we decided Long Beach since it’s always good. We ordered both pepper and chilli crab and thought they had changed the recipe for the chilli crab as it tasted different. In the end we realized that we were served Thai style chilli crab. For those who are craving for the original chilli crab, please make sure you order the right thing bec they assume you want their most popular Thai style chilli crab. I guess we will have to go back another time to have the original one we have been craving for."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood restaurant ,1,40,1/8/2018,"We ordered set menu. Quantity was good enough for four pax. Black pepper crab was very nice. and bamboo clam is also delicious.
My family enjoyed good food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must if just for the black pepper crab!,1,40,12/26/17,To be honest this is our go to destination in Singapore for black pepper crab...it is truly delicious and in fact that’s all we have except for Tiger Beer on tap! Park right out the front and Ideally go next door to Red Dot (see photo) to have a brew or a cocktail first. Sit at a table the garden and listen to the birds - it’s rustic and we love it and we were treated to an approaching thunderstorm yesterday without the rain...bliss.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Chilli Crab!,1,50,12/10/2017,"Great food, especially the chilli crab with mantou. We ordered another serving! Also the fresh baby sotong with chilli and lime, and the signature prawn dish. All in all, a satisfying meal and friendly service too!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Really like Dempsey. Good food & service,1,40,12/5/2017,We were brought here by a local contact & I will make sure I plan a night in this area next time I come back to Singapore. I love how they’ve reused the old British Army Barracks for restaurants & bars. The food here was good & service was excellent. The chilli crab tasted great although you’ve got to enjoy spicy food to manage it
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice dinner with friends!,1,40,12/3/2017,We went for the pepper crabs and your can bring your own wine there for a small corkage charge. We had steamed prawns along with a fresh fried fish. Service is friendly and very good. One of our favorite seafood restaurants that has lasted through time. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good crab, but quite pricey",1,40,11/19/17,"Service was really good! The food was good as well, but quite overpriced in my opinion. Worth a visit when you’re in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs,1,50,11/9/2017,The best pepper crabs in Singapore. We also had the wasabi prawns and Kayla which were superb. A must visit in Singapore
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"For occasions, occasinally",1,40,11/7/2017,"Iconic food does not come cheap in Singapore. At least not crab and seafood.But if you must try crab done Sg style, then there's only Long Beach and Jumbo, cos these are the two popular places to try crab. Some may also include No Signboard and Eng Seng, or some zichar palace at your HDB void deck. But really, when it comes to iconic and signature, only Long Beach and Jumbo should be considered, for tourists and guests from overseas. (cos if you're trublu local, you will either diy at home, which is not difficult; or you will know of some joint somewhere offering cheaper, and perhaps better alternatives)."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Iconic sea food in Singapore,1,40,10/28/17,"Iconic and classic seafood place in Singapore. Claims to be there creator of the black pepper chili crab. Thing is I don't eat sea food but judging by my colleagues, they loved it. Quick service."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Alaska Crab / Best in town,1,50,10/20/17,"Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is now having their Alaska Crab yearly promotion in Oct 2017. I had two times already and going to have another 2 rounds next week. This round the promotion has to order a set course for min 4 people. It is good though because we can also enjoy other seafood such as prawn, fish and bamboo clams etc. Why so many times in a month? simply because they have the best Alaska crab in town esp. price is reasonable at SGD88 per kg - 50% compared normal price. You can choose to have white pepper or chilly or 2 flavors separately. My favorite is white pepper flavor. Lastly, Long Beach has the best Restaurant manager called Priscilla. She provides excellent service to me and my guests. We feel like eating at home. Well done Priscilla. Tip: you can upsize with additional cost and it is worth to do that because the bigger the size the better the crab meat. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE BEST BLACK PEPPER CRAB EVER,1,40,10/20/17,"Arranged by our hotel,very busy Saturday night,We sat outside and enjoyed the cooler weather.Due to the very busy night service was a bit slow but understandable . We sat on a couple of beers and watched the action.We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and side dishes and were not disappointed when they arrived. A Large crab with the most magnificent pepper flavour I have tasted plenty of meat and rice."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great spot for Singaporean style seafood,1,40,10/4/2017,"This place is really casual outdoors (plastic tables on the veranda) but it's a nice spot and very green. There are also indoor tables and private dining rooms that are slightly less casual. The food is standard Singaporean seafood fare, but well done. Quality is excellent. My pet peeve is they can never bring all the food at once even when I ask, they instead bring it when it's ready. The service is average as expected in Singapore. As previous reviewers mention, you'll be charged for everything you touch so if you don't want to pay for the peanuts, don't eat them. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Birthday celebration,1,50,10/4/2017,"Have not been here for many years. Husband reminded me of it so I booked a table for a Saturday dinner.We were promptly greeted at the entrance. As we booked for an early time slot, restaurant was quite empty at that time.The staff took our orders very quickly and made good suggestions on what we could order. My son was eager to eat the famous Singapore chili crab with mantou, a kind of fried bun. Supposed to dip buns in the crab gravy, really yummy stuff!We also ordered fried baby squid, prawn fritters, beef rice noodles, fried rice, venison, etc. Food standard is still high compared to last time. The only downside of the restaurant is no sheltered car park. It was drizzling when we reached there so had to look for brollies in the car. Overall it was an enjoyable experience dining at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant as staff were attentive and food was good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Long Beach, Long Wait",1,40,09/24/17,"I can't complain about food quality. One of the best tasting Chinese seafood restaurants out there. No wonder it is always included in the search results of top 10 chili crab in Singapore.I recommend the following dishes: black pepper crab, crispy baby squid, steam grouper in Hong Kong style soy sauce, roast chicken and baby kailan. These were paired with fried rice with tiny fried silver fish. Really nice fresh taste of the steamed fish and nice juicy tender roast chicken.I also can't complain about the individual service of the waiters. Courteous, and attentive. They knew what to do and they were a pleasure to talk to and ask recommendations about the food.However, the kitchen just couldn't cope with the full house of diners. Our food was served one dish at a time. Delivery was much too delayed. Lastly, the steamed grouper came 20 mins after the first item was placed on the table. Diners cannot enjoy their meal if the dishes are served piecemeal.Would have rated this resto 5 stars."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Pepper and Chili Crab - Charged for the Towelettes and Everything Else,1,40,09/22/17,"I have eaten at Long Beach before and wanted to have the crabs on this trip too. I ordered a pepper and a chili crab, and some baby kailin. I was charged S$2.00 for the peanuts that they brought to the table, S$1.80 for the rolls and S$0.60 for the towelettes. In the grand scheme of things not a big deal from a monetary perspective, but on a S$200 tab, give me a break. I guess that's how they stay in business and maintain margins, but it is irksome to see on the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazingly fresh and succulent (So Impressed),1,50,09/21/17,"Long Beach @ DEMPSEY Located at 25 Dempsey Road. There are many famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore, but Long Beach has to be the top ONE. I make it a point when I have visitors or friends visiting Singapore to take them to Long Beach for there more famous Singapore Chili Crab and black pepper crab and off course for the other scrumptious seafood on offer. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best pepper crab in town ,1,50,09/14/17,"Great food with lush of greenery surrounded , great ambience with many private room and plenty of seats outside . Must try their pepper and Chili crab, bamboo clams, fried crispy noodle (Ho Fan) , drunken prawn and Friend small squid ! Book a private room ahead for part of more than 5 and you will enjoy privacy . Look for Prisilia who was my best manager with food attitude and service ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood,1,40,09/13/17,The food is OK. Average seafood. No choice for vegetarians. The staffs are nice and the service is good. A bit pricey. Went for CNY celebration lunch
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The place for your seafood fix,1,50,9/9/2017,"We just finished a family dinner here in one of their private rooms, served by a very attentive captain who even took our pepper crab claws away to de-shell for us. For big parties (9 of us), their set menus offer good value, as their a la carte prices are on the high side. The price worked out to about $100/head (including drinks of beer and juice), which by Singapore standards is pretty acceptable for a meal in a good setting of quality dishes comprising the freshest of seafood. The menu comprised lobster, crab, steamed fish, duck, scallops with asparagus, noodles and a dessert. Their seafood dishes were indisputably excellent, to be expected of a restaurant that has built its reputation on seafood. The surprise item that we all wow-ed over were the noodles, cooked in an exquisite duck broth flavoured with cabbage leaves and pumpkin. You leave the restaurant feeling good not just with the food but at the way the restaurant staff have all been trained to thank departing guests as they make their way out, making you feel that you have been a most welcome guest."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh seafood with good recipe,1,50,9/4/2017,"I probably went more to East Coast for seafood but never try it in Dempsey Hill before. The whole place is different from the city centre but full of reminiscences of the colonial times. The first dish of deep fried lobster is so fresh that surprised all of us. Unlike the traditional Cantonese way of preparing seafood, there is always a different spice of south east origin in every dish. Same goes to the pepper crab, fish and others. At the end, there is the noodle with blue swimmer crab. It is so delicious to end of the dinner."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Be prepaid to pay but excellent food,1,50,08/27/17,"The meal is bound to be expensive so it's not for those trying to preserve their wallets. However, the food here is really pretty good, especially their seafood choices. Recommended is the chili sauce lala and black pepper crab. Enjoy!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,An Amazing Institution,1,50,08/22/17,"If you like seafood, this is the place to go to, but make sure to wear a colourful shirt, because it is all about eating with hands... Aprons are available for those who want one. The Pepper Crab and Child Crab are truly excellent dishes, when ordering ask the staff to crack the shells for you if you want to avoid doing this yourself... The crabs are massive, but If you want the really big crabs, order them in advance to avoid disappointment as they sell VERY quickly. The Razor Clams are also excellent as are the prawns and generally other seafood dishes. Great to go in a group and order plenty of beer by the pitcher. The staff are great, friendly and happy to provide fast, efficient service. What a great time we had... One small negative point, catching taxi's from the restaurant is not as easy as you would expect... but gives you a chance to walk off the excellent food you have indulged in!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing food in a colonial setting ,1,40,08/20/17,"I usually go to the Long Beach UDMC restaurant so my expectations were high. The food didn't disappoint me, the black pepper crabs were amazing. Whilst waiting for friends to arrive, we had the white bait coated in 7 spices with our beer which was also excellent. Dinner was quite expensive though, S$115 per person.Restaurant is in an old military colonial building and we sat outside on the veranda under a ceiling fan. It was nice but given the choice, I would prefer to be eating by the sea in the East Coast Park.However after dinner, it is possible to visit the Red Dot microbrewery, which is next door."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but delicious,1,40,8/9/2017,The pork ribs are phenomenal! The food is generally nice but a bit on the pricey side. Try to get seating indoors as it can get rather hot and humid outside
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family Birthday Celebration,1,40,8/7/2017,Our family's favourite haunt for good seafood. We like most of the dishes especially the black pepper crab and Lala Horfun. It has free parking but remember to make reservations because it is always fully booked. Private rooms are available if you spend above a certain amount. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Dinner with colleagues - pepper/chili crab,1,40,8/5/2017,Had an excellent dinner with four outside and of course enjoyed the pepper/chili crab as main dishes! Also ordered the bamboo scallops which also tasted excellent. And all with great Erdinger hefe weizen. A recommender!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Still very good,1,40,07/20/17,"It is a must go for the pepper and chili crab! Razor clams with garlic sauce very good. The drunken are also perfectVery casual atmosphere. Do not go with white clothes as it is not compatible with the crab sauces! Only down side no wine selection. Only cocktail beer or sake Reasonable prices. Cheaper than Newton Circle paid 160$S for one pepper crab, one chili crab, 4 razor clams, some vegetable , two bols of rice , one coconut and one beer"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,good place for a big group,1,40,07/14/17,"enjoyed the pepper crab, spicy crab, lobster and a plethora of other dishes. Atmosphere was festive, with Chinese-style private dining rooms. More a casual, big group place for celebrations than a place to take your sweetheart for a romantic dinner. If she wants a beer, a bib, and a big crab... then take her :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,THE PLACE for pepper crab,1,50,7/12/2017,Spendy - 258 SGD for a family of 4 - but a classic place for pepper crab and chili crab. A great atmosphere. You can sit inside or out. In a rustic setting. Highly recommended.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,This place is absolutely fantastic ,1,50,06/30/17,If seafood is your delight you will be well pleased with the Chilli Crab served at this Resteraunt because they are amazing and served by a very friendly staff The place is ideally located on the coast which at night is particularly spectacular by the ships waiting to dock in the background We had been there in 2009 and it was every bit as good in 2017 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,worth-going for crab fans!,1,40,06/28/17,"this was one of the best crab place in Singapore.we visited the place for dinner at 8:30pm, but was told big size crabs were all gone. I strongly suggested those looking for big crabs to call and reserve crabs in advance.We ended up ordering 2 small ones (each $55), trying pepper ad chili taste.The pepper one was great but it was less spicy than expected. much appreciated the smell and taste of the dish.The chili one was nice too, but the sauce was slightly more spicy than the other crab restaurant's recipe.service was good and attentive.we were offered aprons and help on cracking the shell when it was a bit difficult to crack the thick shell. Tho the kitchen did cracked on the shell to prepare it for eating before serving (a nice gesture).in terms of price, this place may be slightly more expensive, in a 10% range, comparing to other crab place.but the decent seating environment and the service were all well-justified."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,How good!!,1,40,06/24/17,Had a group dinner on the recommendation of a co-worker so wasn't sure what to expect but it came thru. The debate of chili vs black pepper crab continued on to the next day. (Both good but black pepper was outstanding in my view). Other menu items were very good as well so something for everyone. Service was attentive and everyone had a good time. Definitely worth the trip. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, very friendly service",1,50,06/21/17,"The food was very tasty. We were a gathering of 20 and had a private room. The service staff were attentive...from the minute we entered the restaurant (all the staff greeted us along the way to the room!!!) Its a little expensive, but the quality was excellent!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top seafood,1,40,06/17/17,"This place is crazily busy which must mean it is doing something right. The seafood is as fresh as possible. Great variety available at different prices which can reach stratospheric levels if you are not careful. The house special of pepper and salt prawns was absolutely delicious with plump juicy prawns that burst in the mouth. We shared a number of different dishes as one does in Asian restaurants and all were tasty. The service was pretty chaotic and their habit of bringing out dishes one at a time is most disconcerting for group sharing. Curiously they supply tiny paper serviettes which are practically useless, which struck me as bizarre in a.place of quality food. Nevertheless the place was packed on Friday night."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must try chili crab,1,50,06/16/17,Have been there several times but the chilli crab always have been the tastiest and never disappointed us. Portion can be big but the friendly waiter always advises you what is best.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best black pepper crab. ,1,50,6/4/2017,This very busy seafood restaurant in Dempsey Singapore does the best black pepper crab as well as the better known Chilli crab. Also try to the razor clams in garlic. Best to book as this is really popular. Stays open past midnight.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Finger Licking Food,1,50,6/2/2017,We had the chill crab and the pepper crab and sweet and sour fish and all three dishes we amazingly nice and their bread was amazing to dip in the sauces. Price is high but so is everything else in Singapore. We paid almost S$350 for the above plush a rice dis and a green dish plus a jug of beer. Overall worth the experience
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to eat fresh and delicious seafood in Singapore ,1,50,6/1/2017," The place is unique in a very nice area in Singapore.When visiting Singapore I always eat there. Food is consistently great. Seafood is always fresh from the tanks in the restaurant - in case wanted, you can feel and touch the food prior to cooking.Place is due to it's performance always full - so I highly recommended to book a table in advance"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tasty,1,50,05/30/17,Extensive menu and delicious food. The crab is a must have both spicy and delicious. It also serves frogs legs. The only negative is that some of the dishes and even the drinks took some time to come. The staff is very friendly and quite helpful. And reasonable pricing.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious,1,50,05/29/17,Chili crab was delicious! Order with fried bread buns and asparagus . Great seafood menu. Not a place for non seafood eaters. Excellent fresh baby coconut
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,a night out with friends,1,50,05/21/17,Good seafood and a decent option for vegetarian. Friendly service and interesting set menus available at reasonable price
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Most delicious crab,1,40,05/16/17,"Had one of the most delicious pepper crab ever. Spicy and delicious. As I was on a business meeting, we were seated with a group in a private box and that helps keeping conversations inside. Beer was served by the Tiger team! Had a 'smoking' good desert afterwards as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Mother's day celebration,1,50,05/13/17,We are seated with a cozy corner which has a nice garden view. Food is all good. Baby squid is crispy with dash of sweet sauce. Assorted mushroom with sio pek chye is unique with the taste. Not to say the lala hor fun is its house signature. The crab of course is the most fantastic dish. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic Seafood - relaxing location,1,50,5/5/2017,"The service is excellent here. It was our first time eating Chili Crab and some other unusual (for an American) seafood, and everyone was helpful. I prefer the pepper crab to the chili crab (a lot less messy), but both great. I think next time I will ask for pepper crab with a side of the chili sauce to dunk it in."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,You have to have the chilli crab!,1,50,04/30/17,"Chilli Crab is the national dish of Singapore, and I know why - its fantastic.I can highly recommend Long Beach @ Dempsey as ""the place"" to get your fix of this soul food in Singapore.The starter courses are great, but don't fill up on them. Move right along to the main attraction. Although its called chilli crab, its not really that hot or spicy.The chilli crab is served with its shell pre-cracked so there is no need to use the nut crackers supplied - go for the claw which contains the best meat, but don't be shy to use the fried sweet buns supplied as a side dish to soak up the sauce. Chilli Crab: 94.00 Singapore Dollars - a bit pricy, but well worth the experience.We did not have space for the pepper crab, but there will definitely be a next time."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good crab but duck was not good,1,40,04/29/17,"We ordered the black pepper crab, it was a bit spicy but it taste good. The duck was very dry and it looks like left over food from yesterday. Taste awful."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chili Crab experience with friends,1,50,04/24/17,Chili Crabs by the sea in Singapore! We had both the pepper seasoning and the red sauce. I liked the red sauce with the rolls best. My husband liked the pepper version so we were glad we ordered both. We were glad we wore the bibs because this is a messy experience! You have to work for your food. Wear clothes you intend to wash afterwards.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at reasonable prices!,1,40,04/20/17,"Brought an overseas visitor here for dinner and he liked the cozy and green location. We ordered black pepper and chilli crabs + fried mantou . We absolutely loved the black pepper crabs and finished these in record time, so we ordered a second plate. The chill crab paled in comparison although it went well with the mantou. I found the chilli crab on the sweet side and too gooey. The steam prawns were fresh and sweet and the fried kailan done to perfection. Overall, a very good enjoyable meal at reasonable prices."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love this location -- delicious food,1,50,04/18/17,"I love love love the food here. I used to come here when I was a student studying abroad in Singapore in 2009. I just returned for a trip with my husband and friends and was delighted to see (and taste) that the quality of the food remained the same. Great for large groups! Try the Singapore chili crab (make sure to get the bread to dip in the sauce) and the white pepper crab. If your group is large enough, order the garlic mussels and the black pepper crab as well. It's a short distance from the downtown area, but it's easy to get to with a cab or Uber. Highly recommend!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Another Great Meal,1,50,04/16/17,"We had family Easter lunch at Long Beach and it was another great meal. Food was very good - chilli crab was not too sweet with a nice bite, cereal prawns excellent, crispy squid a must. Service was excellent and Toni who served our table would be one of the best I have ever experienced. Nothing was too much effort and all with a wonderful smile. Well done!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great outdoor dining on local seafood specialties,1,40,4/8/2017,We went in a group and were seated outside. Very nice. The food was typical and very tasty. Service was very good.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Family lunch ,1,40,4/8/2017,I craved Singapore based pepper crab and went here straight from the airport. While the staff were attentive the place definitely had a worn down vibe and a bit touristy without the benefits...a bit pricey and the food was ultimately serviceable but nothing grand to write home about. Go if you are hungry and in the neighborhood but don't make the effort to go if out of the way.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very good food, service and atmosphere ",1,50,4/5/2017,"10 people group in a room and a round table. We ordered many dishes including: Bamboo clams, chili crab and black pepper crab. With many other dishes. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The privacy that room gave us really helped the great atmosphere and we were able to enjoy each other company and the food. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent black pepper crab and cereal lobster!,1,40,03/23/17,"Our group decided on seafood dining for our get together and the default recommenation was Long Beach, particularly the one in Dempsey due convenience in parking. I was treated to a great dinner of grilled squid with thick sesame topped sauce (really tender), an enoki mushroom dish, fried rice, a most flavorful black pepper crab which was tasty down to the last morsel and cereal canadian lobster which was sweet and meaty. What made our dinner more pleasant was the most efficient, friendly and courteous wait staff. Commendation for Ted, a cheerful young man who was all over the place helping the tables be served their seafood specialties. The place was packed - inside and out and was told this is normal in this restaurant. Dempseys is about 10 minutes from Orchard Rd, reachable only by taxi/car. The nearest MRT stations (Farrar Rd is one) can be quite a walk."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Chili and Black Pepper Crab with history,1,50,03/19/17,"Pros- Best black pepper crab for the money- Food overall is great for the price- Beer is cold and perfect after a long day in the Singapore heat- The restaurant sits on an old British military barracks, so the look and feel is original for the island and the entire shopping area sits on a hillConsiderations- Price: Like any place that serves these massive crustacean delights, be ready to pay around $90-100 SGD ($64-70 USD) for one- Location: It's a little off the beaten path, but still super clean, friendly, and where all of the locals eat- Reservations: Make a reservation if you can, because the place can be in full swing on a Friday/Saturday evening."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Seafood,1,50,3/11/2017,"The best quality seafood I've ever eaten. This is a seafood lovers paradise. So much to choose from and always great quality. I can't go past the chilli or black pepper crab. A messy, finger licking feast of the best quality crab you will find. Squid, prawns, its all so good. Much pricier than your hawker food, but if your budget can manage it, give yourself a treat."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Seafood I've eaten in a long time,1,50,3/5/2017,"Long Beach Dempsey has got to be one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long, long time. It's very much a 'get your hands dirty and stuck in' kind of place. We started with their signature black pepper crab and it was a real treat. Succulent, steaming hot and with just the right amount of spice!We also had the bean curd with chef's sauce, crispy duck, grouper, and durian pudding amongst other things. All of them a delight. The waitron staff are attentive and ensure that your Tiger Beer pitchers are never empty. A wonderful culinary experience. No wonder it's considered a Singapore institution. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,chili crab and more,1,40,3/2/2017,"authentic restaurant for great seafood. Famous for Chili crab, but also the lobster and the other dishes were great. Service efficient and friendly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood, well priced",1,40,3/1/2017,Went here with a large group (20) and the venue and service were perfect for the occasion. One of our local Singaporean friends ordered a banquet and the food was all really tasty. Chilli crab was pretty good but lacking on the chilli front. Beer was Ice cold.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chili Crab was delicious,1,40,02/28/17,"Went there with business friends for dinner, The Chili Crab was delicious, the other choice also good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best chilli and pepper crab everrr,1,50,02/23/17,Just get the pepper and chilli crab and fried or steamed buns.... yum. My husband and I finished 2 crabs (about $75 each) it was a big meal but worth the tummy stretch!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Always a pleasure ,1,50,02/18/17,"Every time I'm in Singapore ,we go out with business friends to LB food is excellent ,pepper crab and lots of other choices. We always sit outside and enjoy the warm evening air ,especially for us Germans in our wintertime ;)This time I forgot my bag at the restaurant and only realized it when I was back my hotel. We have called the management and the manager Priscilla was so kind to grab the bag and stored it until I came for pickup.Awesome !... Tx so much !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,awesome choice of restaurant especially if you have guest from overseas.. pricey but damn good!!,1,50,02/14/17,"my favourite is the lobster cook 3 ways, black pepper and white pepper crab and order the chilli crab sauce by the side to dip with their special buns.. also the kampong mee goreng.. a must go place when i have client from overseas!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,First dinner in Singapore,1,40,02/14/17,"My father and I met up with a friend of ours while visiting Singapore on vacation. His friend suggested Long Beach so we could try authentic Chili Crab and it was delicious! We struggled a bit with the lack of napkins because of how messy the food was, but eventually one of our servers sensed our despair and showed us the nearby cleaning stations. Thank god! Bibs are a must there so make sure to ask for one and extra wet wipes if need be "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good,1,40,2/8/2017,We ordered chilli crab with mantou it was great. For the fish it was supposed to be steamed grouper but we asked for fried fish with sauce n it turned out not too good thou. The service is good and staffs are very friendly. It's better to call for reservation before you come to the restaurant as it's often full house. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood,1,40,01/27/17,"We had the set for 5 people, which included lobster cooked in white jade - so delicious, to die for. Crab in spicy tomato base is very delicious and we love the kampong noodles and the dessert is so impressive when carried out with the dry ice"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Two meals in 4 days! ,1,50,01/16/17,My absolute favourite and a must! I crave for their food and we went twice in 4 days for dinner! Excellent as always!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Food and Really good service,1,40,01/14/17,"This was my second visit to this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Friendly staff and very good food. Their Pepper crabs are quite nice and worth the money.
Will be returning on my next trip!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing black pepper crab!,1,50,1/8/2017,"The restaurant is pretty large in size with indoor and outdoor seating.
The black pepper crab was simply amazing. A must have if you are in Singapore.
The service is also very good.
Would love to visit again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must have,1,50,1/4/2017,Was taken to this restaurant by a fellow colleague. The food was amazing everything served was cooked perfectly everyone 7 out 7 did not have a dish they did not like. There crab is one of the best dishes to recommend. Will return to this restaurant again next time I come to singapore. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's always been my fave chilli crab place!,1,40,1/2/2017,"I always go there every time I go to singapore just to eat their Chilli Crab, Mantou and bamboo clams! And yesterday, 1st Of Jan 2017 we had their set menu, everything was good except the fish, it's soso. The beehoon with clam is so goood, tastes like homecooked food. :) the price is also ok :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Casual Seafood place ,1,40,1/2/2017,"Very nice casual seafood restaurant with outside seating on the terrace. Dempsey Hill is a trendy part of Singapore with some pretty colonial style bungalows. The restaurant serves great Singaporean (mostly Chinese) dishes with an emphasis on fish and seafood. Must try's are the black pepper crab, the steamed grouper in herbs. The atmosphere is casual and the staff very professional. A good choice for a relaxed meal in a leafy green outdoor setting. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chili Crab,1,40,12/26/16,There are more famous Singapore Chili Crab places in Singapore but I like Long Beach for an overall great Chili Crab night out. I love the Chili Crab and fried bread with a few frosty Tigers. It's also convenient from Orchard Road and has plenty of parking. I've taken a lot of visitors to Long Beach and it's always been good.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper and Chilli Crab in Singapore,1,50,12/26/16,We make it a point to go once on every trip to Singapore. We were 6 so we ordered both the Black Pepper and the Chilli Crabs. I loved the Chilli but my son and daughter in law loved the Black Pepper. Hint: Your waiter will remove the meat from the shell if asked. (highly recommended) We all agreed the Royal Razor Clams with Garlic were spectacular for a starter and of course we had Fried Buns (to lap up the chilli sauce) Fried Noodles were perfect and the Fried Kailan with Garlic added to the treat. Draft pitchers of Tiger Beer and coconut / mango jelly to finish the meal. Reservation is a must.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab and pepper crab - WOW ,1,40,12/19/16,"I was there with some business colleagues to get some local seafood. The chili crab was great but for me the pepper crab was awesome. I was surprised by the intense pepper taste. So hot and remarkable! To ease the hot food try the coconut water. It became my favourite beverage at Singapore. The atmosphere was... Ehm... It was really crowdy and the plastic chairs don't feel comfortable. Anyway: if you love seafood, go there! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Convenient Long Beach,1,40,12/17/16,Long Beach seafood is one of the famous Singapore seafood chain. This one is located in the Dempsey park which makes it more convenient than the original on the south coast. Food is good and the location is nice. We enjoyed our chili and pepper crabs.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Actually reasonable value for money,1,40,12/16/16,"We went to the Long Beach Seafood branch at Dempsey this week. The food was surprisingly reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Pepper crab was S$63 per kilo and beers were just over S$7 each (330ml cans of Heineken). The total bill for 3 persons with more than enough to eat was around S$220. Really not bad. The service was decent, and the waitress cautioned us against ordering too much instead of pushing extra on us. Atmosphere isn't fabulous but it's OK. Probably a much better deal than the tourist traps along Clarke Quay or Boat Quay."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili Crab is the winner,1,50,12/9/2016,"Its interesting to read the extremes of reviews for this place. I really liked it. Having visited Singapore a few times, I haven't yet found a better chili crab - I guess for my taste. The black pepper crab isn't as good as I have found elsewhere, but I go here to sit outside and eat crab, sauce and buns. It simply doesn't get any more complicated than that. I've not noticed the prices being particularly high and the service is invisible - its just about the chili crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,great seafood.,1,50,11/26/16,"The seafood was fresh, beautifully cooked and well presented. Everyone in our party thought it was superb."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It's all about the crab,1,40,11/15/16,"To eat crab and really enjoy it you have to get down and dirty. There's no way to not use your fingers. Without a proper protective bib you will ruin or at least stain whatever you happen to be wearing. Bibs are thoughtfully provided and discreetly tied around your neck here at Long Beach. And they are very necessary since you will want to get down and dirty with these crabs. The two kinds of crab we tried were the chili crab and the pepper crab, and I would recommend trying both. Sometimes chili crab can be so spicy that you miss the flavor of the succulent meat. I thought they got the spice just right here since it was spicy, but not so spicy that you didn't appreciate the high-quality of the crab. Both were delicious. A fresh shrimp starter was also delicious. The seafood is kept in gigantic tanks in the restaurant so freshness is guaranteed. A noodle dish we ordered late in the game was not quite on the same level. However, you come here to eat seafood not noodles. The restaurant is a bit out-of-the-way but taxis are very reasonable in Singapore. I think chili crab is a must to try here and this would be a great place to do it. Wash it down with your beer of choice. On a sidenote don't bother with the Singapore sling. I think it tastes like chewed bubblegum. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice restaurant to try Chilli Crab,1,40,11/14/16,"We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend and aware it would be expensive. We specifically wanted to try the Chilli Crab and the black pepper one but it was hard to judge how expensive these would be from the menu. The menu is very long and none of the set menus included both of these for only two people. We explained to our waiter and he said he would bring us two small crabs one of each type, we also ordered a rice dish, a vegetable side and some buns for the crab. For a drink we had a pitcher of beer. The total bill came to around €140 which was ok given we had been warned about the expense and had ordered two expensive dishes. Both crab dishes were nice but if you only get one the black pepper one was the best for both of us. On the whole we really enjoyed our meal. It looked like a place that was full of both expats and locals rather than tourists so a lot of repeat business. Given the chance I'd go back too."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best seafood in town ,1,50,11/14/16,"Hands down the best crab experience you can have in Singapore. If it gets better than this, you might have to revisit your standards. Wasabi prawn, Alaskan black pepper King crab or just the traditional Singapore style, served with ice cold Singaporean Tiger beer and staff that will make you want to go back two days later (just because you might still be to full to eat on the next day). MUST-TRY"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pricey but well worth it,1,50,10/31/16,"I love the food here. From the soup all the way to dessert. Each dish was well executed - taste, presentation. The lobster dish with cereal was worth the extra calories. The chili crab is as I remember how chili crab should be made. The black pepper crab was rightly named Famous Black Pepper Crab :) The steamed fish was so tender, it just melted in the mouth. Even the roast chicken got raves from our dinner guests. Definitely will be back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best seafood meals ever!,1,50,10/29/16,"This was one of the best seafood meals I have ever had in my life. Along with Restaurant Andre (where I ate during my last visit) this is my favorite place to eat in Singapore.We skipped drinks because we had just come from the rooftop bar at MBS and ordered the food straightaway. We ordered one of their signature set menus.The first course was Steamed Live Scottish Royal Razor Clam with Minced Garlic & Vermicelli and it was my joint-favorite dish of the night. It was followed by their signature dish of Pepper Crabs which was really really good and a close second in terms of taste and flavor for me. This was followed by Fried Leek Flower with dried scallop and olives which was average, I didn't really care for the leek flower. This was followed by my joint favorite dish of the night - Deep Fried Flat Rice Noodleswith ‘La La King’. The deep fried noodles gave the dish the perfect crunch and I just couldn't stop eating. Dessert was Rose Jelly Coconut Cream which was decent but didn't come close to the awesome dishes we had eaten earlier."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome black pepper crab,1,40,10/27/16,"Three of us ordered 1.2kg black pepper crab, kailan veg with garlic, deep fried calamari, and cereal prawns. All the dishes were very good with the crab being awesome. I recommend to get a plate of buns (fried or steamed) and ask the waiters to bring some extra Chili Crab sauce for 'dipping'. The black proper crab is a little more spicy and assertive on your tongue, whereas the chili crab is a little sweeter - I prefer the former. The meal came to about SGD $220 which is reasonable given the items. Be wary of them pushing their set menu which is a lot of food for about $120-130/head. Overall, one of the best crab spots in Singapore. The Dempsey area is great with lots of other dining and beverage options. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Big portions,1,50,10/27/16,"We had a good talk with the manager on the choice of the menu and she recommended us the set dinner and was happy to accept alterations to it, extremely service oriented. The menu for 6, though 4 of us were Europeans, was more than enough, had to bring doggy bags."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crabs and More,1,40,10/23/16,I usually bring overseas guests to this place as they normally stay around Orchard Road. The old colonial buildings are always a conversation piece.The chilli and pepper crabs are always well received by my guests. I must add that they are actually fantastic and spiciness tweaked to guests preference! The service is also great....maybe since I am there often. And they serve my favourite Erdinger beer!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Cosy family dinner away from the city,1,40,10/20/16,"The set dinner menu was excellent for a table of 10 and we could not even finish it all! Had to 'doggie bag' the left overs.The ambience was great and what was more excellent, was the attention being paid to the us by the service staff and especially one of the staff - Shirley Sun. She was a great and pleasant host to us all! She was quick and pre emptive to know our needs and wants which she never failed to deliver within a prompt amount of time.The food was good, not excellent but enough to satisfy our love for chilli crabs!I will visit here again with my family!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper Crab and Chilli Prawns,1,40,10/18/16,"Myself and son visited this place for lunch today. We ordered the following :-1) Margarita- the cocktail was just about average.2) Pepper Crab- this was awesome, the best part was that they shelled the same on request. Eating it without all the effort was superb. Fresh crab, succulent meat. Spice was just perfect and recommend for those who enjoy pepper and spice.3) Chilli Prawns/Shrimps- the chilli sauce or gravy and the perfectly cooked fresh Prawns are an awesome combination. Dip the hot, soft and really soft buns into the gravy and it is paradise.4) Veg/mushroom noodles- was just average nothing to rave about. The service was attentive and good. Prices are almost fine dining prices. Enjoyable experience."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood!,1,50,10/4/2016,Excellent chilli crab. Good value with excellent service. We opted for a set menu with a couple of extra dishes which was a good way to have a selection of what is on offer
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place to try pepper or chili crab,1,40,10/4/2016,"As one of the most famous and expensive (relatively speaking) restaurants that serve pepper or chili crab, Long Beach has a big reputation to live up to...and it did deliver. We tried both the chili and black pepper crab which were both excellent. Would also highly recommend the fried prawns prepared using their 'house special' style as well as the seafood fried rice. While we didn't try the set menu options they seemed to offer decent value given the range of dishes it allows to sample. Restaurant offers also a range of other seafood dishes. Given its reputation the place was packed and reservations are required. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab To DIE FOR!,1,50,09/28/16,For the best seafood in SINGAPORE if not the world! Nothing like Alaskan King Crab flown in and marinated in delicious black pepper. What an amazing team dinner!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Finger lickin Pepper crab and live steamed razor clams,1,50,09/23/16,"Be realistic about what you're looking for, you want a place that does seafood (especially crab) and does it well.We normally don't do set menus but the S$148++ menu had what we wanted after reading reviews, the Black pepper crab that this company 'pioneered' and steamed live razor clams. Easy.The razor clams came out in individual serves, surrounded by a fragrant flavourful broth, and a garlicky vermicelli with sweet clam meat. Delicious. The pepper crab was just as expected, peppery goodness with lots of sweet mud crab meat. Don't be shy to lick your fingers. When the staff offer to pick the claw meat out for you, take up the offer. It ended up being half a crab each person (4 pieces each).We didn't really expect much from the next dishes but the fried leek flower with dried scallop and olive was a good taste bud refresher after the crab, followed by a bland looking but very tasteful deep fried flat noodle dish with clams. Also a theatrical dessert of rose jelly coconut cream, dry-ice drama and all. Not overly sweet, by refreshingWe went on a weekday lunch after an easy simple booking via website and prompt confirmation via email the day before. It wasn't busy at 1pm, the staff were absolutely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was casual but the service was a notch above, dishes flowed seamlessly and the wait staff were keeping tab on our progress to ensure this (at a distance of course). Some reviewers complained about the cost but expecting to pay rock bottom prices for seafood just bc you can get a $4 meal at a hawker centre in this country is unreasonable, the price was comparable to any decent mud crab/live seafood restaurant in other parts of the world. Also, I don't understand why you would give a bad review based on your definition of what lobster should taste like at a restaurant most people choose for the crab. We walked from the Tanglin gate of the botanic gardens, 20 minutes in midday heat but next time we'll use uber, the Dempsey hill area has lots of little roads leading to other retail outlets so you could end up walking around a bit to find Long beach at the back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place for seafood lovers,1,50,09/21/16,"Most people told me about this place for chili crab and pepper crab. But I was warned that it was for ""tourists"". So I had mixed feelings but I still went over. I went for salty egg sauce crab, some green and noodles Hong Kong way. Wow absolutely fabulous, so delicious. Amazing taste whatever you take. Extraordinary! Plus the setting is great, old colonial house on Dempsey road, under the palms, in the green. Loved it!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Singapore's Hot Spot for Chilli Crabs ,1,50,09/19/16,"Expensive yes, however the world famous Singaporean Chilli Crabs do not taste or served better elsewhere. It's a must try if you want the real thing."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chile Stone Crabs Never Disappoint,1,50,08/23/16,Stone crabs and tiger beer a winning combination at Long Beach Restaurant. Dine outdoors on the lovely porch and enjoy! I am in Singapore ever year for business and always make it here -- my 3rd trip!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Top notch quality from the original creators of the black pepper crab,1,50,08/23/16,"It's been a long time since I ate at Long Beach Seafood. It's been a household name for the longest time. I was not too optimistic when I entered the restaurant because the interior looked jaded. I was wondering if the food and staff will be jaded as well. After my friends decided on what to have for lunch, we placed our orders-A 3.5kg Blue Alaskan crab cooked both ways-Chilli and white pepper, Geoduck sashimi, Golden Line Lobster, Fish Maw soup and veggies.The manager told us that there were only two Blue Alaskan crab and we took on of it. When the crab arrived we asked if they could de-shell it for us. The staff was more then willing and we were happy to hear that. Not only did they de-shell it they also played it nicely and we were impressed. When we tasted it-it was OMG! One of the best chilli crab we ever had, the meat was sweet and tender to the bite and the sauce was top notch bursting with flavors or the spices and chilies. Next can the white pepper crab and man it took it to another level! The white pepper sauce had a Nic buttery taste to it as we dipped the crabmeat into it and into our mouths. My friend who always had a judgement for most foods was speechless! I enjoyed that moment. Next came the Geoduck it was sweet and crunchy as a sashimi. They also told us to dip the other part of the geoduck into the double boiled stock to remove the smell. And it tasted so good but way better then abalone. Mind blowing! The lobster was good too and fish maw soup was delicious. Overall we had an excellent lunch and the seafood was top notch in terms of flavors and freshness. A must visit if you ever come to Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Service!,1,50,8/9/2016,"The food is really amazing, as its freshly prepared and extremely delicious. We did have a small issue with the sambal chili used (Because it smelt wierd on the bass) but overall the experience is really amazing. The staff are also attentive and friendly, making the atmosphere really friendly."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"awesome experience, but expensive",1,40,8/8/2016,"wow, this was awesome. messy, spicy crab but so worth it. we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer. service was great. didn't seem like a touristy place at all. my only complaint is how expensive it is. the crab and all the sides we had were great, but I wish it could have been a more reasonable price. oh well, everything in SG is expensive. I'd go back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"""Yummy Yummy Chilli Crab""",1,50,8/7/2016,"Had dinner with friends and family last night. We enjoyed the Chilli Crab most with the Mantou or Chinese fried buns compared to the Black Pepper . Cereal Live prawn was so-so. A different taste from your usual ""Zhi Char"" stall. You have an option to have this dish with or without the shell of the prawns. We tried the one without prawn shell as we were lazy to peel them. The deep fried baby squid was yummy . My all time favourite dish when dinning at Long Beach Dempsey. Worth trying the Beancurd dish with Chef special sauce . Many thanks especially to Assistant Manager William and his team Man Yanyan who always takes good care of my family and friends . Service was excellent even though the restaurant was running full house yesterday . Remember to book table in advance to avoid disappointment especially the weekends. Private rooms are available from min spending of S$600 onwards .. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy Sri Lankan black pepper Crab,1,50,8/1/2016,The best and biggest Sri Lankan pepper crab ever. 2kg for 2 person to share. Steamed razor clam from Scotland. Stir fried Baby kai lan with crispy salted fish and their signature crispy tofu. Full with Great satisfaction!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sea food,1,40,07/29/16,"I highly recommend the chili and peper crab. Good service and nice atmosphere. Although located in the center of Singapore, you are around nature."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea foods ,1,40,07/24/16,"Thinking about seafoods at good restaurant at weekend in Singapore without a prior booking, forget it as there's always a long que at fully booked ones! I was lucky to have one table for at this rest. one week ago. The geo duck was fresh and great for shasimi, the black peper crab is the specility of the chain since its early day and still keeping to its fame! Tip is that you should book a few days ahead for weeken to get an indoor table and order everything you want from begining or wait for quite a time as it's too crowded! Overall it's worth the price!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food,1,40,07/22/16,Was there for a business dinner and we started with deep fried prawn which is well seasoned. Next was cili and black pepper crab. The crab was big and I had the privilege of eating the claws. Personally for me black pepper crab taste better despite its more spicy. Steam fish with cili is okay and would prefer just plain steam. The scallop was soft and tender. The steam clam was cooked perfectly. The only let down was the fried rice which has not much taste. That was the only dish that was left nearly untouched. Overall it was a nice seafood experience and would recommend those who loves fresh seafood
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Yummy yummy,1,40,07/17/16,"Cant use words to describe how delicious of the food. You can try different crabs in singapore, this one with black pepper is highly recommended for those who love spicy."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Sensational Singaporean Seafood,1,50,07/16/16,"ScrubySnacks loves seafood and Long Beach did not disappoint at all. Every single thing we ordered was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. As per usual, we over ordered but spent many hours simply grazing and enjoying the wonderful vibrant atmosphere of the restaurant and fantastic service from their chirpy and entertaining staff. Highlights were definitely the steamed crab and pepper crab. The very enthusiastic waitress even helped to crack the claws open for us which made it even more enjoyable. The crispy mini octopus was also deliciously sweet and moorish. If you are in Singapore and looking for the very best seafood, ScrubySnacks would highly recommend a visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey. Cannot wait to return, next time with elasticated pants. And don't forget to wear the bibs as things can get a little messy, but don't worry, it's all part of the fun and experience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Exclusive Golden Phoenix fish,1,50,7/9/2016,"We went on a warm evening, and glad we had a ceiling fan at our table. David Ng, assistant manager, really made some great recommendations. We simply had bamboo clams, Hongkong style steam Golden Phoenix fish, mushroom and vegetables. David shared that Long Beach has the exclusive Golden Phoenix fish in Singapore, all imported from Malaysia highlands. I was skeptical as this is a fresh water fish, but it really tasted very good. Will be back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food and lovely place,1,50,7/1/2016,"We had dinner in this place in our second day in Singapore. A good friend of mine invited us there to taste Singapore as the locals do. The experience as great and the price very good. We had crab, prawns, soup, snacks and all very nice and nice taste!i recommend this place for good food and value!thanks for everything Maria"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great place for local cuisine and Crabs,1,50,06/29/16,"This is the place to visit if you want to try the local way of cooking the Crab Dish. Try the Chiili Crabs with buns or the Black Pepper Crab if you like spicy food . For children or adults that do not take spicy food , you could try the mouth watering salted-egg crab. The restaurant also served delicious seafood cuisine cooked mostly the Cantonese style. The restaurant is set in a exquisite location -Dempsey where many other restaurant and cafes are located too . Nearby you could also visit quite a few furniture gallery which sell very nice wooden items . Enjoy "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood Restaurant ,1,50,06/28/16,There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore. Our family has visited the various shops of the various brands. Long beach at Dempsey Hill is top in our list. A bit further away from city centre but it is worth to spend the time on the travel
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A heaven for sea food lovers ,1,40,06/28/16,"The Mecca for sea food lovers with the black pepper crab a must try! Loved it! The chilli crab palors before it. A special mention of the Singapore prawn curry, I loved it so much I bought loads of the curry paste to carry back with me. The place though has a peculiar smell but it is probably attributed to the sea food holding tanks which makes the decor of the restaurant. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Average Dining Experience,1,40,06/22/16,"We went for dinner as recommended by friends.
The staff that attended us was friendly & attentive, however the food was just average."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Very good seafood restaurant,1,40,06/21/16,"Dempsey hill with all the restaurants, pubs and clubs is a very nice place to visit. During our last visit in Singapore we went to the Long Beach restaurant. The food was very good. We had the famous chili crab and several local dishes. We enjoyed it very much. Prices were also quite reasonable. Also for the beers and wine. Wine and beers can be very expensive in Singapore restaurants."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Original and best ,1,50,06/20/16,Not many words required. Just go. Order the black pepper crab. It's simply delicious. Messy. But delicious. Don't bother with napkins. Get stuck in and just wash your hands in the basins later. Enjoy.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Could be summed up in a word ""YUMMY!""",1,40,6/12/2016,"The name LONG BEACH has been a Singapore icon since it began in all humility on a sandy beach by the lapping tide in Bedok, long long ago circa 1970's. The original LONG BEACH was run by a couple who served up the most delicious chilli crab EVER! Today there are several outlets and this one in Dempsey is but one. It was my son's birthday and his dear wife organised (and paid for) our family dinner there. We got a private room, not a mean feat, (the lady has clout!)The food was delicious and a good meal was had by all. They have some children play equipment downstairs, should there be a need to entertain the little ones.Uber may be a good idea for carpark spaces are filled up fast."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Ate until we were too full to move!,1,40,6/9/2016,"Another place we visited recommended by our friends. A bit crowded when we came, but our order came fast somehow. The chili crabs were really great, especially the black pepper. My wife and I ate so much that we were too full to move. Thankful for the waiter's (Adam if not wrong and he was just wonderful with his service) for his constant refills of water and suggesting the ice cream as dessert. Kind of expensive but we think it was worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black Pepper Crab, amazing !!!",1,50,05/29/16,"Great food, fast service. A must for any traveller to Singapore. The seafood is excellent and a nice setting at Dempsey Hill"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab!,1,40,05/15/16,"We always try different chili crab restaurant every time we go to Singapore and so far, this is the best. We went with our friends, and forgot to tell them to serve the fried rice together with the chili crab and everything, not in the end (it's their culture to eat the cheap food in the end) "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"OMG, try the chilli crabs!",1,40,5/8/2016,"If you are new in town, check out Damsey hill and definately make a visit to Long Beach for their chilli crabs. Sure the place is a little pricey compace to some other places in town, but Once you taste that thick, glorious gravy with soft fried buns, you'll know it was worth it. They have some set meals which works out quite worth it for group dining as well."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab lived up to reputation,1,40,5/8/2016,"Early Saturday evening managed to secure a table for four even though we had not bookedOrdered the signature prawns, I really liked, but the family were not that impressedThe Black pepper Crab was a little slow in arriving bit worth the wait.Don't know why we have been before as just around the corner!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab rules!,1,40,5/2/2016,Long Beach is a well establish local seafood restaurant and their Dempsey location is designed to be more upscale than their original place. The service is good and the location is easy to get to in the city. We had wonderful pepper crab which is my favourite dish. We also had a very good fried pomfret fish. Good place for local seafood when you visit Singapore. I actually prefer it to their beach location.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach - Longing To Go Back,1,40,5/1/2016,"@TheKuoKnowsMany people will say there are only two names worth considering for the famous Singapore Chillie Crab. The truth is there are many.But my favourite is probably one of the two popular names, namely, Long Beach @ Dempsey.There are several Long B"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Place to go for crabs,1,50,04/29/16,"We went there after a long day in the meeting and by 8pm they were full. Good that we have reservations. Of course Singapore is famous for their huge chilli crabs but this place also serve white peper crabs. Maybe for me chilli crab is now common, I kind of like the pepper crab more. It comes with additional white pepper sauce for those who likes the strong pepper aroma. My colleague who is vegetarian had to watch all those shell cracking but he insisted that his fried rice and shitake mushroom with beancurd were all very tasty too. The meal is supposed to end with a great dessert in durian pudding but unfortunately they ran out of it and we had to go with the mango pudding, which was good but you know, its not the king of fruit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli crabs indulge in nice setting!,1,50,04/25/16,"Been to this branch of the franchise several times and always find it a hit due to the Dempsey Road 'upscale' dining location. Nice place to bring family and overseas friends to have seafood, get your hands dirty over chilli crabs and other yummy seafood. Can set you back quite a bit depending on what seafood you order and recommend to make reservations if you are going over the weekends but definitely a great dining experience. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent meal--ate too much!,1,40,04/24/16,"I visited this restaurant with a group of colleagues as a special occasion. We had an excellent meal, with various dishes, including their signature Chili Crab. Each dish was well prepared and well presented. In the end, we had more food that we really needed, with the result that most of us ate too much. The ice cream and red bean sauce that came at the end of the meal actually helped overcome the feeling of ""fullness"". The only potential damper on the evening was the fact that the restaurant refused to call cabs for us when we were ready to leave."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab was outstanding ,1,50,04/22/16,Visit Long Beach @ Dempsey at the recommendation of my hotel concierge. Very nice and not too expensive. Food was great and staff was awesome.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,1,40,04/21/16,All I can say is they serve the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore hands down! The place can get real busy but it will definitely be worth the wait. Big plus for me was the Filipina who manages the table bookings. She got us a table inside where it was cooler. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Food!,1,40,04/19/16,"Booked a private room as it was night out with colleagues. First time here, and I was very impressed with the quality of food. I would suggest booking a table outdoors if you enjoy the tropical weather.Try the Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab and Lobster salad!Downside though, the service was sort of disoriented as the dishes that were supposed to be appetizers came out late while the crabs came first. We were a group of 15 though, so I am not sure if it is the usual occurrence or a fluke. Nonetheless, the food was definitely worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Historic Setting and Great Food,1,50,04/17/16,"We enjoyed a business dinner here and had a lovely experience in a private room. Fresh seafood in a variety of preparations, including a beautiful whole fish prepared to perfection."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Delicious, and nice touches",1,40,04/13/16,"Delicious: chilli crab (spicy yet subtle and not over-powering), deep fried baby squid, pork ribs. Nice touches: bibs and crab shells unusually well pre-cracked that further cracking was not need to get to the contents. Efficient and responsive service; perhaps being a weekend and not full helped. Pricey; as expected for fresh seafood."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good seafood,1,40,4/4/2016,"Was craving for razor clam and theirs are great, yummy. The crispy squid and tofu also yummy. The crab is ok, nothing special, same with all chilli crab. In overall its a good seafood restaurant, but reservation is highly recommended as its so crowded even at 6pm"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Overall, a good meal",1,40,4/1/2016,"We had one of the set and overall the dishes are good. We had crabs cooked 3 different ways - chilli, black pepper and salted eggyork. The fish was fresh and the steamed prawns is cooked just right and juicy...just a little small for my likingRoasted chicken is good, aromaticThe fried rice (with small little fish on top) looked bland but packed quite a bit of flavor and I think there are small crunchy salted bits of fish in it tooFish maw soup was very watery, although not lacking in flavor.Had also the 4 combination starter - too salty for one dish and they are all fried, this is the lowest in my list from the meal.Veg with 3 eggs came very soupy, and I loved the soup!The stir fry veg with garlic is quite the standard fareI opted for their signature durian pudding for dessert. It is quite thick with bits of the fruit, but it was below my expectation as it doesn't give me the omph I was looking for.There was a big waiting gap between the crab and the rest of the dishes. Our plates got piled up very quickly with crab shell, but after a while the service staff got around quickly replacing them.Overall, the meal was very good as the +s are more than the misses.Will return "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good sefood,1,40,03/30/16,A good place for some authentic Chinese seafood a good menu that caters for all types. we were there for a quick business lunch. Good selection good service and the food experience and tastes were wonderful. Spend some time and try the menu.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome,1,40,03/19/16,"Nice food, great service...what else can you expect? chilly crab is the best, and the shrimps with garlic lol....recomended"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food delivered very efficiently,1,40,03/19/16,"This place runs like a well-oiled machine. Good service, good food with the white pepper crab a standout. I have no idea about the cost because one of our group picked up the bill."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Private Room - Privilege Service,1,40,02/29/16,"It was a business dinner and we were allocated 2 private rooms with a great view of the greenery behind Long Beach @ Dempsey. Our VIPs from Europe and UK were very pleased with this view as we sip beers and discuss about various matters.Having been to Long Beach @ Dempsey for many times, it seems dishes served to private rooms are of higher quality in terms of flavor and decoration. At least, this time round, the food was excellent and our visitors very much enjoyed their meal to the last piece.The captains were attentive with our requests. They paid good attention to our VIPs, for example, servicing them with apron when the ever famous chili crab dish was served. Of course, they never forget us too! Fully pleased with the services.We will continue to recommend this place for Business Dinners if VIPs are interested in excellent seafood and peaceful greenery."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice Seafood,1,40,02/28/16,"The seafood is still good as before. I personally still enjoy the chill crab, still creamy and go very well dipping it with bread. If you want it spicy, you will be disappointed as it is not spicy. But the black pepper crab are more spicy than the chilli crab. The Thai style squid are chewy and with the Thai chilli sauce on it are not over power and the cabbage goes along well too. The bamboo clam cook with the garlic are well cook too.Average price if you want Crab, Prawn, Fish and squid are between S$60-90/person"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super sea food !,1,50,02/22/16,Long beach is ideal place for Chinese sea food lovers and a great hangout place for team and group dinners with quality beer and wine. We ordered lobsters and crab and it was awesome.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious food in an unpretentious setting!,1,40,02/18/16,"Chilli crab, pepper crab, clams with garlic to start! Fabulous! Don't forget to try the bread for dipping! We were lucky to visit with friends that helped us choose the best options!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crabs - the best ,1,40,2/10/2016,"Had a family gathering with delicious food ! Have the Singapore chili crab - great sauce, remember to order the steam and fried bread to scoop up the gravy !! Black pepper crab - crab so fresh n well cooked. Try the cereal prawns - one of the best with so fine cereal crumbs n tasty fresh prawns. The service was prompt and efficient too. We will be back !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Never Disappoint Us....,1,40,2/9/2016,This is the place that we hold our Chinese reunion dinner@Chinese New Year Eve....Black pepper chilli crabs were as good as expected....they added new dishes into their menu....wasabi prawns and fried hor fun was real special and tasted really good....The atmosphere was nice and good attentive service....We will come back again next year.....
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Chili Crab, Pepper Crab, incredible fish",1,50,01/18/16,"Great food, good service. several choices of dining areas, indoors, outdoors, private rooms with AC. Book in advance. You can bring your own wine or sake. True Singapore Crab dishes."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Razor Clam,1,40,01/15/16,"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurant in Singapore, they serve the best crab. But my favorite is razor clam steam with garlic and the canadian live oyster. They have live alaskan crab woow"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best black pepper crab!,1,50,01/14/16,"Had an amazing meal at long beach. Black pepper crab was so intense in flavour & the chilli crab was lovely and rich, it was such a shame to have to leave the rest of the sauce! We also had the whole peeking duck which I highly recommend. Having the skin taken off & rolled up into pancakes at our table then having the meet brought back stir fried over crispy noodles was one of the most memorable and tasty meals of my trip."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Huge delicious crabs. Consistently good restaurant ,1,40,1/9/2016,A staple with my family. Black pepper and chilli crabs are really good. Probably only in Singapore. Fried baby squid and belacan clams also v delicious. I particularly enjoy the thick and fragrant sauces. We had three 2 kg crabs. Huge and meaty. S$78 per kg. Very enjoyable!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper crab ever,1,50,1/8/2016,"Basically, we echo what other reviews have already mentioned. If money is not an object, do go for a treat. Between my wife and I, we ordered 800g of Black pepper crab, deep fried fish (Yaw cham soon hock), mushroom and vegetable tofu and two drinks. It was S$168. It was pricey but the crab was the best we have eaten. What was surprising was the fish! It was so well done and tasty. Soft and fluffy with a simple but yummy soya like sauce. Overall, it was a real foodie experience. Unfortunately, there were no razor clams that day. A real disappointment. To be honest I have not tried others like Jumbo or many other places but I will definitely go on a foodie hunt next time we are back in Singapore. You might want to try their set menu which cost somewhat similar but you get desert. You might want to ask how much crap you get."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Definitely must go for seafood in city center,1,40,12/30/15,"Very tasty and delicious seafood. Great location, across from the Botanical Gardens. Nicely located in greenery with various bars walking distance for after meal drinks. Fast service. Definitely a genuine taste of Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best and fast seafood ,1,50,12/25/15,"Freshly made seafood some even taken live from the tanks, fast service that brings you the food in twenty minutes even long taking food like crab. Surely one of the best seafood restraints in Singapore and I encourage them to put out more branches"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Better pepper crab,1,40,12/8/2015,"We orignally were heading top Jumbo on Dempsey Hill but was convinced to try Long Beach for pepper crab. As it's the first time we've been to Long Beach we ordered the set menu with pepper crab. Wife was really happy with the food, where each dish was quite good and the flow was commendable. Started with steamed razor clam with minced garlic. Clam itself was fresh but a bit ordinary. It was however the garlic, shallots and soy souce that was memorable. Light and not to salty or pungent. Pepper crab was a bit spicey but better than Jumbo's. Ordered a mud crab, slightly smaller than what I would have like, where the crab meat filled the shell and was very moist. The noodles with clams was very nice too. Even the vegetable dish was a treat. All in all, I think we polished off everything served. A bit pricey but both my wife and I agreed when we're around Dempsey Hill we'd be going back to Long Beach over Jumbo in the future. Location is a bit of a problem as you need a taxi to get there and back. We asked the restaurant to call a cab for us, which worked out well. Could improve on the furniture and interior though as everything looked a bit worn. Other eateries on Dempsey Hill have a flasher look but less patrons. Couldn't hurt to update the presentation. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yes, this is the best pepper crab in Singapore",1,50,11/29/15,"The interior in seafood restaurants in Singapore is generally not what you normally associate with fine dining. You sit on plastic chairs and you can forget about white linen. But no big deal – you go there to enjoy the crabs and eating them is a messy affair.Long Beach claims that they are “creator of the original and the best pepper crab of Singapore”. I am personally a big pepper crab fan but I don´t take tag lines like that for granted without my own research.As expat living in Singapore I have done thorough investigations across the island in my search for Singapore´s best papper crabs. My conclusion: the pepper crabs in Long Beach really are the best in Singapore. They are juicy, spicy and deliciously prepared.Case closed.In addition, Long Beach is a nice and an easy accessible place. Book table, take your time and enjoy your food.Not all seafood places in Singapore have the same attitude."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,best Chili crab,1,50,11/19/15,"The Long Beach restaurant is still the best place for Chili crab or black pepper. Big portion, service is good and fun.
very fresh sea food. A great place to bring your oversea visitors ."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,1,50,11/14/15,"We only had one night in Singapore on a stop over. We made reservations after we were recommended it by a friend from Singapore and we're glad that we did as this place is very busy. We went for the set menu and tried the razor clams, noodles la la and black pepper crab. It was all delicious...if not a little messy to eat! Would highly recommend, not too expensive. 148 dollars for 2 people set menu which was more than enough food. Full of locals and ex-pats, a taxi is needed to get there."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Hey, quite ok actually!",1,40,11/6/2015,"Went there with visitors from Europe, did not expect much but was happily surprised. Nice service compared to jumbo, good crabs + rice + veggies + fish.
Only downturn... Very expensive... SGD110/head..."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great sea food,1,40,11/2/2015,Long Beach @ Dempsey is really easy to get to but do make sure you book as it does get very busy especially weekends and holidays. You can either request to sit out doors or inside the restaurant. Evenings in Singapore are pleasant so it's not a problem. I love the chilli crab so that's always one dish I order.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,CHILI CRAB - A MUST!,1,40,10/29/15,"I have been here a couple of times with my colleagues. Food wise it's slightly better than it's next door seafood neighbor. Their floor staff is always on the ball, ensuring you get what you wanted. Best to make reservation before heading there, opt for private room if you are spending more SGD600 per table. Private room able to combine if you have more than 1 table."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab delight! ,1,40,10/7/2015,I had the chili crab and it's as good as my taste buds expected . They say it's more known for black pepper crab but didn't have a chance to try it . The mango sago was just ok but bonus points on presentation . The crispy kangkong with cuttlefish was average ... I wish I had the baby kailan instead . I'll rate the resto 3.5 stars but rounded up since I put more weight on the delicious crab over the other average dishes and average service. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood Experience away from the bright lights,1,40,09/19/15,"Making the trip to Dempsey Road, near Holland Village is worth your taxi fare. Being welcomed by all staff at the front door and being ushered into the Restaurant surrounded by large glass tanks brimming with fresh and very active seafood.The initial ""wow"" was tempered by the extensive range of extremely fresh crabs, lobsters, fish plus anything else you can name. The sight of large live Alaskan Crabs is worth a visit without even looking at the extensive range of other seafood.Oysters - some of the best I have ever had and this comes from someone who lives on the Western Australian coast!The staff were attentive without being ""in your face"" and they had as much fun as we did over an enjoyable luncheon.Food prices very reasonable but, as usual, alcohol was expensive and no shock as this seems to be the practice - charge maximum dollars for alcoholic drinks.The visit to Long Beach was well worth it - great meal, great venue and away from the normal hustle and bustle of the city centre. Try it you will not be disappointed. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great time, go crab!",1,40,09/19/15,"We came here with 9 people and had a private room. We got one of the 10 course dinners,more at least it seemed like ten courses. We had both the chili and pepper crab. Both were excellent. The other food was also quite good. The pudding dessert had a great presentAtion due to the dry ice. All of us were extremely satisfied. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Local food, great taste",1,40,09/17/15,"I was taken here by people in the know. This is not fine dining, its rough and ready with plastic chairs. Service is fun and on it, really enjoyed the banter, although not completely sure anyone knew what was going on. So, we had some starters and then the main event which was Chili and Black Pepper crab. Strangely do eat the Chili crab first as the Black Pepper leaves your mouth numb. Fortunately some local noodle dish took away some of the numbness. My friends ordered some kind of fried buns which went in the Chili sauce and added to the yumminess of the whole experience. Cheap Plum Saki which was lovely, some good service and the night was made, The crabs were properly cracked and cooked, everything was very tasty, and there is a plethora of taps to wash up after right outside the door, bibs to protect clothes from splashes of the various sauces. Worth a try, great vibe and you have options to sit in or outside (depending on the Haze and the Heat)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,world class Black Pepper crabs,1,50,09/16/15,"I remember coming to this restaurant as a kid, another time a few years ago with a friend, and now by choice. Their back pepper crabs is just something that will bring you back to this restaurant every time you are in town. It is made with such an incredible recipe that i could not find anywhere else in the whole world. You will never regret coming to this place even if this was the only thing you will order.The seating areas isn't the best in town but the food is definitely is without no doubt. just try to make sure you book in advance because showing up without a booking might disappoint you as it is always a full house although they have over a crazy number of tables"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crabs I've Had,1,40,9/11/2015,"Strictly speaking, there is one more restaurant that serves equally good pepper crab. That is Keng Eng Kee. But Long Beach is consistent. KEK is perhaps 80% of the time.Coming back to Long Beach, yes, This is the signature dish that you must try. Of course it has other good food, but those are merely good, not outstanding.Chili crab? I think Jumbo at Dempsey Hill does it better."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood!,1,50,9/2/2015,"Wonderful seafood! You won't be disappointed by the food, although I wish it would all come at once and not bring out the vegetable dish when we have almost finished eating everything else!The staff were very welcoming in this occasion and it was great that they shelled the crab for us. Note you get charged 30c for each towelettes you use and $2 for a plate of peanuts that you did not order, and they automatically add 10% service charge, but if you know this in advance then there are no surprises!You cannot beat the seafood here.... I will be back next time I am in Singapore for my next visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili and black pepper crab to die for,1,40,9/2/2015,"I try to make it to Long Beach on every trip to Singapore - at least one time and more if I have the time. It is outstanding. Get the buns to smoother in the chili sauce - YUM! Service can be slow and inattentive (as they are busy) the place isn't that nice, but the crab is great - just go enjoy."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food at a historic location with great service.,1,50,08/29/15,"Great food at a great location with great service, and with a little bit of history. There is a lot on the menu to choose from, and it's hard to go wrong. This is a place you want to put on your ""must do"" list for Singapore, not just for good food, but for the atmosphere. Outstanding seafood. The pepper crab, the shrimp and the sweet/sour fish were excellent. Sitting outside on the veranda in the evening, with the overhead fans going, and a slight cool evening breeze made this seem like a throwback to the old colonial days. (Probably a lot better food today than then, however.) The (relative) cool of the evening made veranda dining a pleasure. And they serve ice cold beer well: in refrigerated mugs. There's nothing like having an ice cold beer on the veranda on a warm evening, while waiting for an outstanding meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Excellent Seafood, lively resturant",1,40,08/23/15,"We ate twice here during June and August. The fresh coconut juice, salt and pepper prawns, lobster, black pepper crab and chilli crab are all exellent. The atmosphere in the clearly very popular and busy restaurant is very lively. We all thouroughly enjoyed the food. Service seems rather brusque, but the restauant was extremely busy on both occasions. One one occasion we were billed for peanuts we did not have whichwa quickly corrected although with no apology and why in this quite expensive establishment do they charge for hand wipes, essential if you are eating the crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To get business relaxed ,1,50,08/18/15,"Long Beach is absolutely one of the best restaurants after hours of business negotiations. The noisy and busy atmosphere, the beer jug and the job with the crabs keeps your discussions not just in business but helps to get everyone relaxed. You can watch how the experienced waiter pulls the crab apart, don't even try to do it yourself. You are able to watch the fishes to swim in the aquarium which shows how fresh the food actually is. The service, well, don't expect too much of it because the restaurant is full of local people and the waiters are busy to serve those who are loud enough to get the attention. Some junior waiters don't even understand a word of English. Anyway we got very good service and good recommendations also about what to eat. Our menu was meant to 3-4 persons and it costed just some 250 SGD. A jug of Tiger Beer was 27 SGD. We were happy and will go definitely back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Some of the best food i've tasted,1,50,8/2/2015,"The nasi goreng was excellent. So simple yet so good. Love the silverfish and the bean sprouts. The crunchiness was just right with the right amount of sodium that left me wanting for more.The fried kailan with garlic was amazingly perfect. It was soft and crunchy at the same time. Perfect texture. Not salty, not overfried. The cook really knew how to make fried kailan.Chilli crab was delicious. The gravy was cooked to perfection. I should have asked for a recipe."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crabs! Crabs!! Crabs!!!,1,40,07/27/15,"Wonderful local Singapore fare. Had some fresh coconut juice to start then some amazing black pepper crab, chili crab, prawns, and local chicken. Veggies were amazing as well. Lovely dessert of a yam soup and fresh fruit. Make reservations as it gets packed. Sat outside and the breeze was wonderful. Plan on using your hands and being ok with that. Makes eating much easier so if you're ""above"" that sort of thing this isn't for you. Plenty of water bowls and wipes. Very attentive service and great food. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent Seafood!,1,50,07/20/15,"Great Place a bit out of the center. Here they serve seafood from around the world, also Norwegian crabs :). This is one high end place with stiff prices. But really worth a visit. Here one should try their speisalitet Pepper crab and chilli crab. Prepare for a delicious taste experience. But that said, this is not for everyone's wallet."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great food, great atmosphere",1,50,07/19/15,"The Dempsey area is a bar and restaurant complex that contains many options. Long Beach is a definite highlight. Although it is hot they offer al fresco dining on the veranda, an inside area and private rooms. How much you like your chilli may determine whether you choose to sit outside.The menu is long and varied. You come here for the crabs of course but our starters of crispy mini-squid, razor clams and sesame prawns were fantastic.We had two crab dishes - in chilli sauce and pepper. You get plastic gloves and a bib to eat this course and you have to dive in with your fingers. The crab claws are as big as your thumb and index finger, meaty and delicious. Both dishes were amazing but for me the pepper crab just edged it - all washed down with ice cold Tiger beer. A great sign that so many Singaporeans eat here, although service may be a bit rough and ready for some! I loved it"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,It is All About the Delicious Crabs!,1,50,07/19/15,"Pepper, White, etc. The outdoor and porch dining is also a plus! The stinky pudding is another thing. A MUST GO destination in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese restaurant,1,40,7/6/2015,"Really nice chinese cousine. Very rich menu and fantastic sea food. One of the best crabs in Singapore that I tasted. Service also very fast and professional.
Place to go back."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Super delicious seafood cuisine,1,50,7/1/2015,"A big thumbs up for the service and food. First of all, surroundings fantastic. Restaurant set among old colonial buildings in Orchard area. Though a bit remote to reach without a car but a great place to visit to have a totally different feel . Food is super delicious . Crabs are really fresh and cooked to the right texture and taste. A must try is the black pepper crab and the salted egg crab. Though slightly pricey, but it is still worth it. Recommended strongly especially for a great family day out."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous for crabs,1,40,06/24/15,"We had chilli crab, chilli squid with convolvulus (kangkong),clams with hor fun noodles, deep fried marinated baby squid, a special bread (fried man you) to go with the chilli crab sauce and bamboo clams with garlic. My friend ordered the dishes and she is very familiar with the restaurant. Service was average. They tried to give us someone else's dish and we had to remind them about one of our dishes.The food was generally delicious. The dishes were not garnished or presented in an attractive fashion. You can byo wine. Seating includes air conditioned area indoors and al fresco outdoors. The tables are packed closely together. Restaurant is small and it is fairly noisy. Little ambience. Worth going for the seafood itself especially the crab which was meaty. They serve a large variety of crabs, some of which are air flown in from overseas eg Canada"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilli Crabs in Singapore,1,50,05/31/15,You can't visit Singapore without trying the Chilli Crabs and the best place to get them is Long Beach at Dempsy Hill. I have had them at other places in Singapore but this tops them all. And while you're at it get an order of the razor clams as an appetizer.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach,1,50,05/30/15,Excellent seafood restaurant on Dempsey Road. Try their freshly boiled king prawns and pepper crab. Delicious.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A great find,1,50,05/23/15,"Our concierge recommended this restaurant. It did not disappoint. Delicious food, friendly, helpful staff and coeliac friendly. Whole mud crab for $72. The place was full of locals and the food very fresh. Definitely recommended."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab..... Yum!!!,1,40,05/22/15,"We asked the concierge of our hotel where we could get the best Crab in Singapore. Long Beach Dempsey was the recommendation and we were not disappointed. Not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded!Bustling, full of locals and whilst the service is no fuss the wait staff were happy to take time out to explain the dishes. They took pleasure in your curiosity and enjoyment.Exceptional value for money."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Hot hot hot pepper crab,1,40,05/13/15,"first time come to this restaurant, we ordered a dinner set for 10ppl, size is big enough, indeed we can't finish all dishes. Black pepper crab is hot and spicy, taste fresh. Curry crab come with fried buns, dip curry, u really want to eat your all fingers. Staff are good service and very sincere. Worth to come with your business partners."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,good,1,40,5/12/2015,"all was great. We visit the place every year with my family. I can't wait to get back , next year, hopefully. I reccomend 100%"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilli Crab in Town,1,50,5/10/2015,Chilli crab is a must......dose the sauce with the steam bum. Main dish will feed 3-4 easily. Great atmosphere (outside is better). Service is fast and pacey. An icon to always visit.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great lunch after our Sunday walk at Henderson Waves,1,50,04/19/15,"Looking for great crabs to match your wine? Long Beach at Dempsey is super highly recommended...we ordered crabs that were prepared in 2 different ways. Most people would order the famous Chilli crabs with mantou(buns that are either steamed or fried), but what we ordered are crabs cooked in white pepper and the other one with salted egg...it is a ""must try""...we paired it with a great French white..Puligny-Montrachet...what perfect pair...another highlight is their unforgettable Crispy Duck paired with great red wine...it so crispy that you can also chew its bones..no exaggeration... I can go on and on and on...the best thing to do is just visit Long Beach at Dempsey especially when you have foreign guests. You'll never go wrong. Bon Appetite"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab vs Pepper Crab,1,50,4/6/2015,Even though Singapore is famous for Chilli crab ... the pepper crab at Long Beach was awesome .... I think better than the Chilli Crab. We ordered the Pepper Crab and the prawns with chilli crab sauce. Both great but the enjoyed the spicy pepper crab more. Must do. Open till late. One of the few place in Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I like it,1,50,03/26/15,Got a set meal with lobster and Black Pepper crab the food was delicious and the crab went well with the Erdinger beer. Good atmosphere and service will definitely come back when Income back to Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,authentic seafood in genuine atmosphere,1,50,03/23/15,"This is a must while visiting Singapore, the seafood is prepared in an unique way-tasty, elegant, not sparing products, simply delicious"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Serious seafood,1,50,03/18/15,I was invited for Sunday lunch here. Exceptional seafood including sharks fin soup. The chilli crab was mouthwateringly delish and I'm not normally a crab fan.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chinese New Year Eve Dinner,1,40,02/26/15,This is our favorite restaurant for my family reunion dinner every year for the past 3 years. The food was fantastic on every dishes. Black pepper crabs is a must and never fails us with its consistant quality.The service was good as we were lucky to book a VIP room. The fish and other seafood were very fresh and of course the main lo hei dish also very good!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,a typical tourist place... with great taste of food...,1,40,02/16/15,"well, if its your first time in singaporeor the first time you about to try the chilli crab, it is a go to place for you..I like the blackpepper crab better than the chilli crab but always love the fried bun that comes along with it tho'..Overall food was great..I dont know about the pricewise because I didnt pay, LOL...But worth to try if you come in a big group."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice chinese seafood restaurant,1,40,2/4/2015,"They have package menu which we took for 5 pax. Cost slight above S$300++ and what we got was prawns, steamed tilapia, roast chicken, a mushroom & veggie dish (i thought this was really good) in some white broth, 2 large chilli crabs with fried mantou, a plate of fried rice and a bowl of yam like dessert. Had a pretty enjoyable meal but would expect a better fish than a Tilapia which they gave us an option to upgrade it to a promfret at a price. We declined so didn't find out how much. Not sure if this is a reasonable price in Singapore but coming from across the border, I thought it was pretty expensive,"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistent seafood quality ,1,40,2/1/2015,"I have eaten Long Beach for a long time. It's always best to have a proper master head chef in the kitchen. I come here once a week for dinner, sometimes more often. The crab quality is usually excellent, whether chilli or black pepper. They have other great dishes, and some seasonal ones too. Call to book in advance, else you will be disappointed as they are usually fully booked. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Long Beach Seafood is consistent,1,40,01/29/15,"I have always liked Long Beach Seafood @ Dempsey. Be forewarned, if you can get out of Long Beach for under $60 per person you have not experienced their black pepper crab or chili crab-and you definitely haven't washed it all down with a beer. I suggest going at lunch as they actually remove the entire crab from the shell. I also like to sit outside on the veranda. This is always an experience. One recommendation--bring your own napkins, towels, and/or go into the restroom and grab a stack of paper towels. These are seriously messy dishes and the restaurant will provide the equivalent of a tissue and wetnap for the end of the meal. BTW-- Long Beach is much preferred to No Signboard and several locals highly recommended Hua Yu Wee on the East Cost for crab which I did not get to."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good for sea food,1,40,01/18/15,"Recommended for sea food lovers, others find some other place. Crab is the specialty, prawns were good, rice and tofu okay. In January the weather holding, outdoor ambiance is great."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Private room, big round table & big big tasty crab.....",1,40,1/7/2015,"Scrummy delicious food. Beautiful octopus to start, seriously tasty white fish (can't remember the name), and to crown it all a wonderful red chilli crab and a a white pepper crab. We also had some chicken, vegetables, rice etc. Dessert was a mango pudding in a smoking glass which was a real treat too. Just wonderful. The taste, the quality, the quantity - all fabulous. Will be returning to try the black pepper crab too. The service was excellent, many waiting staff and the food came pretty quickly so not too much waiting. A good selection of wines also.Definitely worth a try."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and good service,1,50,1/6/2015,"We went there twice during our trip, recommended by our local friends. The service is great. They are honest with weighing the market price seafood. All dishes are tasty. We like the Razor clams with garlic. The prawns in herbal soup is also good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best black pepper crab in Singapore,1,50,1/2/2015,"I've lived in Singapore for 2.5 years and went on a crab quest (self-assigned) to crown a champion for all preparations of crabs. After extensive (and extremely pleasurable) research, I can say with surety (after 4 visits to be sure of consistency) that the black pepper crab at Long Beach Dempsey is the best in the land.If you want a monster crab (2 kgs or larger), call ahead and reserve the crab when you reserve the table. Otherwise, the crabs will more likely be in the 1 kg range, which is still quite large. Generally, I prefer sitting inside because it can still be pretty hot outside at night.Unfortunately, the fried buns, a Singapore crab staple, are only OK, but you don't really need them with black pepper crab.Other side dishes are great too, but the star attraction is the incredible black pepper crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,For Seafood Lovers,1,50,12/12/2014,"Our friends came from Hawaii which is known for its fresh seafood - but they were completely in awe of the freshness and variety of the seafood we ate at Longbeach. Call ahead and order some of the dishes you like - the Razor Clams, A Steamed whole Fish, Black Pepper Crabs...to name a few!Reservations are a must. And they have big private rooms too. Friendly staff and a bustling place!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pretty good place for banquet style dining,1,40,11/14/14,"It's always easy to be positive when someone else pays, which was the case for this visit. That said, we enjoyed our evening very much. We were a large group (9) in a private room. After the appetizers we moved on to chili crab which was delicious. The accompanying sauce was quite thick and tasty. The large prawns were really very good. We also had a chicken dish and fish, both of which were good. The small bowl of fried rice nicely completed the main part of the meal. Desert was presented in a small bowl placed on top of a larger bowl of green liquid with dry ice so that frosty vapors were pluming from around the mango custard. Quite well presented and fun.I understood that the cost was around S$100 per person including plenty of Tiger beers.Definitely worth a visit, even at one's own expense."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yummy crab, shelled for you",1,50,11/3/2014,"Serving 500 pax every night, this restaurant is pumping out crab dishes left, right and centre. It's busy, but the service is fast and friendly. We picked this crab restaurant over the others because they will shell it for you- meaning it's not as messy as usual! Lazy, perhaps, but worth it as I don't like eating crab to feel like a work out. The manager showed off the Alaskan crabs (at $800SG a pop), but we settled on a Sri Lankan version. Worth a visit- it's not fancy, but it's a lot of fun. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Outstanding Chilli Crab!!!!!,1,40,10/29/14,The chilli crab here is to die for.....just super along with the fried bread rolls. Their fried rice is a must have and the chef's special prawns too. This is the BEST place for chilli crab so don't try any other place.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved their pepper crab,1,40,10/23/14,"Slightly smoky like it was off the BBQ added a delicious layer of flavour. Their special prawns were also excellent, eat the shells and even the heads if you are game! Loved it but beware of the price ++ as this adds plenty to the cost."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"not fancy, but good food!",1,40,10/15/14,"I had my first chili crab @ Long Beach, was finger-licking good.
But what's better were their drunk shrimp soup and coffee pork!!!!
Would love to go back if i am in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome Pepper and Chilli Crab in town,1,40,10/1/2014,"Having eaten at quite a few famous crab restaurants in SGP, i have picked the Long Beach Dempsey's Chilli and Pepper crab dishes as the best among those i have tried.Their 'house special Prawns' is a must try and so is the garlic baby kailan.The presentation of the Mango and Durian puddings looks better than they taste, even with them tasting pretty decent.Def will go again..Visited this place like a 100 times with the most recent being in Aug 2014."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Good (albeit oily) food, but not great value",1,40,09/29/14,"The food is quite good - especially the chili crab and black pepper crab, but frankly the leading seafood houses (eg. Long Beach, Jumbo, No Signboard, etc) are exploiting their fame (busloads of tourists or vans full of visiting businessmen descend on them!) to charge very high prices. You can have as good seafood at much lower prices at more out-of-way eateries."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Chilli Crab is ok, Black Pepper Crab will change your life",1,50,09/23/14,"As per my title....the Black Pepper Crab is simply amazing.
Word of warning. This restaurant is very basic (albeit great food). And bring lots and lots of your own wet wipes and napkins because you will need them."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A Pleasant Surprise,1,40,09/23/14,The food was great as always but what was surprising was the exceptional service . We were not looking forward to this meal as the last time we were here the service was horrendous . Something must have happened bec the service was faultless. Water n tea glasses were topped up without having to ask for it . Plates were changed between courses. They even offered to peel the crab shells for us ! What a breath of fresh service air !! Well Done Long Beach !!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing Chili and Black Pepper Crab,1,50,09/16/14,Great Seafood Restaurant. The best chili and black pepper crab we had in a long time. All the other dishes we had been all very tasty and yummy. If you are in Singapore it is a must that you try this restaurant out for their great seafood.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Where I will go for authentic chilli and white pepper crab,1,40,9/12/2014,"Love the chilli and pepper crab! Fried baby squids is excellent with beer!
Dislike the queue if you have no reservation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent crab - but it comes at a price...,1,40,9/4/2014,"We had dinner there in late August and we went there for their famous crab of course.The black pepper crab and the red chilli crab were indeed superb, as was the service. We made a reservation for 6 persons but were 10 persons in the end. Even the restaurant was fully booked, they arranged a bigger table for us in no time and service was always friendly and attentive. Though the crabs were really big and succulent, I feel the price was a bit hefty (around 1200 Singapore Dollar). I had excellent crab in a less exclusive setting at much lower prices in Singapore before. Also it was a bit of a let-down that they did not serve stingray, which is a real delicacy in Singapore.Nothing bad about the food or service, but next time I will probaly go to a less exclusive place enjoying similar excellent crab (and stingray!)."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wow is their food ever good!,1,50,9/2/2014,"As a group of six persons we enjoyed their chill crab and pepper crab tremendously. Finger licking good. Also their puddings and jellies for desert, especially the durian one, delicious. Friendly and helpful service personnel, especially when it comes to help us cracking the crabs open. The atmosphere is laid back but attentive service staff who doesn’t mind going the extra mile. Definitely a place to go back to and enjoy more sea food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Chilly Crab,1,50,08/23/14,Outstanding service with a smile. The presentation of food aand assistance from servers was great. Worth a repeat!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great food with a terrific ambiance.,1,50,08/17/14,We had chili crabs and pepper crabs at a business dinner. The crab was great. Very good prawn chow fun as well. If the weather is good be sure to sit outside. I like this place.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Very good food, neat area",1,40,08/16/14,"We went here for dinner after a business project and was very impressed. We had chili crab (really good), black pepper crab (really, really good) fresh prawns, some coffee pork dish and some veggies ... everything was really quite excellent!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The kind of place you'd like to get crabs.,1,40,8/8/2014,"Singapore's famous Chilli crab is something you have to indulge in. It is spicy, it is messy, it isn't the cheapest meal out but it is worth every dollar, especially here at Longbeach @ Dempsey, a wonderfully transformed colonial building in lush surrounds. A great laid back spot to watch the live crab tanks, enjoy some cold Tigers and mop up Chilli crab goodness with delicious, sweet fried buns. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious black pepper crabs!,1,50,8/6/2014,"Crabs, prawns, fish... what's not to like? The best black pepper crabs I've had in my life was at this seafood restaurant. It's finger licking delicious! The atmosphere is nice and laid back. The choice of food is wonderful. I'll definitely be coming back here."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Must do in Singapore,1,40,8/6/2014,"This place was so good I went twice in 5 days. Originally taken as a guest of a local, we ordered the house specialty prawn (excellent dish), pork ribs and the famous black pepper crab. All meals were excellent but the crab lived up to the reputation... Went well with a nice cold jug of tiger.Atmosphere is very casual and relaxed and perfect for a warm evening - will be back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab !!!,1,50,07/30/14,"I went in this restaurant with Colleagues. Our Host ordered for us traditional Singaporean food : Prawns, prawn cake and many other dishes. One outstanding was the Black pepper Crab !!!
It is tasty, spicy but not too much, and kept all the Crab taste"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fantastic crabs,1,40,07/28/14,The black pepper crabs and chilli crabs were excellent. Be sure to order the buns to soak up the generous amount of gravy that comes with the chilli crab. It gets crowded during dinner on weekends and it would be advisable to make a reservation. Pricey but superbly done and fresh. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crabs-BEST!,1,40,7/11/2014,"Long Beach@Dempsey is one of my favorite restaurants to entertain my overseas friends. This restaurant is very popular among locals and tourists and best to make reservation. It gets really busy during dinner time so be prepared to wait for a table, for walk in customers.I always order black pepper crabs which Long Beach is well known for. A few of my favorite and familiar local dishes are : fried sambal kang kong, roasted chicken, Fried beancurd, sauteed prawns with salted eggs and baby squids. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood,1,50,7/3/2014,"Great place for chilli and black pepper crabs and other Singaporean delights. The food is delicious. Some of the wait staff may not be the friendliest, but worth going."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Different venue, same great food",1,50,7/1/2014,We generally visit Long Beach at East Coast Seafood centre but thought that we would try a different outlet on this occasion. The venue is very interesting - an old army barracks. We sat on the verandah which was very pleasant. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed it very much indeed. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili and Black Pepper Crab,1,40,06/30/14,"This is actually the second choice by my sis when we visited her. Jambo is her first choice but it's fully book, all the branches!Ordered Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roast Chicken, Beancurb and lala noodles. Crab is big (1kg or so). Very good. Roast chicken is good too! In general, good food.Remember to order dumpling to soak up the chili crab'a sauces!Service wise is good as well. Reservation is a must as this is also popular place."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The Chili & Pepper Crab Experience in Singapore!!!,1,40,06/16/14,Having visited Singapore many times and not had a chance to try this must have experience I made sure to tell my friends to put in our must do list this time!!! The toss up was between Jumbo and Long Beach with many friends being either fans of one or the other ….. The one we went to in the end was Long Beach … the Dempsey branch as both Jumbo and Long Beach have multiple branches ….. The Dempsey area in general has really developed into a great area with eateries and cafes bustling throughout the day and the night. The two must have dishes the Chilli Crab with the fried Bread and the Pepper Crab we ordered of course with extra pepper sauce on the side (which you have to order separately to dip the crab in for the full experience). Apart from these two dishes we ordered the butter prawns and the steamed sea bass in soy sauce. The place itself is one of those mass production eateries which have a formula and do large turn arounds and fast service …… The food started to arrive pretty fast and we put on our bib's and picked up the crab cracking utensils and got to work !!!! The Chili Crabs and Butter Prawns came first …. the Pawns were really good and hit the spot …. the Chili crab a bit Challenging to get to the meat for a first timer but once you did was definitely worth the effort. The Fried bun with the Chili sauce was also really really good ….. The Pepper Crab ( we ordered the black pepper …there is also white pepper crab which is supposedly also pretty good) which came had a completely different flavor and the friends kept asking which I liked better …. my answer was i liked the variety both were excellent and the combination was amazing ….. the steamed sea bass with soy sauce was also good but both the crabs being the hands down winners ….. A definitely must do experience in Singapore!!!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"no frills, but good food",1,40,06/15/14,"The seafood is very tasty and well priced. Service is courteous and prompt. However the setup is very low key - plastic chairs, no bib for covering the shirt etc. If you want tasty good definitely try this."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Gracious Service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng,1,40,06/14/14,"NIce setting in Dempsey Road. There's a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. Here's what we ordered:1. Steamed Soon Hock - Well prepared and fresh2. Sri Lankan crab - Full and well prepared3. Half chicken - Well prepared4. Poach prawns - Fresh and well preparedCombined this with gracious service by Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng:1. We were initially allotted a table in a tight space. She moved us to a bigger table when it became available.2. Due to misunderstanding, she allowed us to change our initial order without any fush. Most other places would simply say ""Already prepared"".3. Other staff members are attentive and gracious. Perhaps because of their prominent name tags which provide them with an identity and pride in their work.Overall a great experience. We spent $380 for a party of 5 adults and 2 kids. Would say it is value for money. If the management is reading this, please pass on the compliments to Jenny Cheng and her team."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice seafood,1,40,6/10/2014,"From the iconic east cost place, the Dempsey venue has not lost its original character. chili crab is excellent, the black pepper one also. The diner experience is worht a visit, located on the hills, the outdoor sitting is a lovely experience, perfect for family and friends.A must do visit, to go back to without hesitation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Nice place for seafoood,1,40,05/27/14,Nice seafood and ambience. Try the pepper crab. The service was good and they even tried to remove the shells from the crabs for you even if the place was crowded.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper crab,1,40,05/23/14,"First of all i have to admit i am a little biased as black pepper crab is probably my most favourite dish in Singapore, so most trips for me are excellent. However I have been to long beach many times, at both Dempsey and at the East Coast, and its definitely one of my top choices! Boasted as the 'creators' of the black pepper crab they certainly never disappoint! Its spicy and fresh and always makes for an awesome, fun (and often rather messy) evening dinner. I highly recommend you give it a try and I will certainly continue to keep coming back!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Chilly Crabs...!!,1,40,05/21/14,Long Beach is located at Dempsey Hill which was previously the old British Army Barrack. This place is huge with many restaurants to choose from. I particularly like the Black Pepper Crab and Chilly Crab... This is somewhat an achievement for me as I don't usually take crab... :)
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,No.1 in seafood freshness,1,50,05/16/14,"This branch is quite huge. Being in Singapore means having black pepper crab and I was absolutely satisfied. The crab was fresh and meaty and had just enough pepper sauce on it. It was on the dry side but finger-lickin' good! The prawns and the steamed fish were equally fresh and flavorful. The claypot enoki mushroom and cabbage was clean to the taste. For dessert, we had sweet yam paste with ginko nuts, which for me was a little bit too thick. We washed everything down with refreshing Thai coconut juice. Service was exemplary. Will definitely be back! Tip: There'a a playground where kids could have fun while waiting for the food."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food and wonderful service!,1,40,05/14/14,"Celebrated a loved one's birthday last night at this popular seafood restaurant with some close friends. Gotten a private room that allow us to truly enjoy our dinner without any qualm of disturbing others or being disturbed.Wanted to have both the popular black pepper and chilli crab at the same time, the manager was able to make recommendation that allow us to order the set menu with some changes (with minimal additional cost due to my selection of dishes) to suit our taste bud. Both choices of crabs were delicious and the roasted peking duck was good too especially when they prepared the meat in their recommended cooking style.All of us have totally enjoyed the food and the evening of celebration and catching up.Will definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good food, good ambiance and good service. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Black pepper crab, yummmm",1,40,5/9/2014,Having the famous Singapore black pepper crab at thus restaurant is a must. This venue has a vast array of seafood and all of it is very good. Prices are not the cheapest but the quality is worth it.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delicious Crab,1,40,5/8/2014,May Linn was our amazing server here. Friendly and welcoming. The food especially the black pepper crab was amazing. We also had the crispy duck which was equally outstanding. The restaurant was busy but we got seated within 5 minutes. Amazing experience and right in the centre of Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Much better choice than Jumbo, No Signboard",1,50,5/7/2014,"Excellent 'genuine' seafood from a big chain brand, albeit still easy for tourists to enjoy. Food cooked very well, not just the seafood but the other meat/vegetable dishes as well (which is a good test of the overall quality of the kitchen). The other big chains esp Jumbo are tourist traps with poor food, rude service as they expect most of their guests to not come back. Many locals in contrast come to this branch."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Pepper crab - a must have when in Singapore,1,40,5/6/2014,"Our friends told we had to go for Pepper crab when staying in Singapore. Based on Trip Advisor and the hotel we reserved dinner for two at the Long Beach. The food was great! The pepper crab was delicious along with asparagus and fried rice. I wish we had bread to soak up the sauce. The only negative was the service was a bit pushy for us to order more dishes than we could eat. There are better set up for groups of four or more. Still, I would go back. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I love it!,1,40,5/5/2014,The food and the service is great. The black pepper/chilli crab is delicious. I visit this institution almost every time we visit Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly!",1,50,04/29/14,"Great seafood! The scallop, lobster and crab were heavenly! The 2 of us arrived without a reservation but was given a table for 90 minutes. Fair enough.. Food was amazing and worth the rushed experience :)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Crab de luxe,1,40,04/17/14,"Local expat recommended this place, and it is absolutely worth it! We did not have a reservation, but got a table by ourselves on a separate terrace, and still decent service. We had the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab and plenty of beer. Great taste and great fun. Kids played around us and the night was great. Bring your own napkins!!!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab never eaten among South East Asia,1,40,03/23/14,It was my best place I ate a very good crab in Singapore @ Long Beach 'Dempsey' & among the South East Region!I really enjoyed the place.Very well known / Famous place !!The service is quiet good and followed within time but sets order by order!Anyway I really enjoyed eating my Crab from Sri Lanka !
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Lively place,1,40,3/11/2014,"Big crab, if seafood is your thing, then this place is somewhere to visit. The live crabs and fish are really interesting and entertainment for the kids. Very busy, Book in Advance!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,What an experience!,1,40,3/6/2014,"A friend who had lived in Singapore suggested this place to us. And what an experience! We had pepper crab, which was divine and baby squid which was amazing! Coming from a country where seafood is plentiful I was skeptical about the outcome but this place really rocks. The restaurant was fully booked as people were still celebrating chinese new year but service was impeccable. Try to get in early to enjoy the scenery as well and avoid the queues. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,the peper crabs are back!,1,40,3/2/2014,The Sri Lanka peper crabs are just excellent. The location is nice : the large terrace is quiet. This iconic restaurant is quit expensive. Try it if you can afford it.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Old Style Singapore Seafood - the Best,1,50,02/17/14,I've been a follower of this Long Beach branch since its heydays at Marina South. I will not go to another restaurant for seafood unless I have no choice. Their signature dish is the black pepper and chili crab. Their latest creation of soft and crispy hor fun is great.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,iconic singapore restaurant,1,40,2/9/2014,"going to Long Beach is one of the must-do things for any visitor to Singapore. there is also another brand but this is convenient since it's in town.the chilli crab and pepper crab are both amazing. something that every visitor has eaten. and must eat. apart form other dishes, these are the 2 that I order every time I go there.if you haven't visited long beach, then I suggest you do so - you will not regret it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chili crab with mantou craving satisfied!,1,40,2/7/2014,"Been craving for chili crab with mantou so had to come and eat here. As usual place is full packed because it's CNY week and i think also the reason why their crabs this time were smaller. We also ordered the pepper club and the cereal prawn. I would say, my craving was satisfied. Had a cool white wine that went with it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Singapore food,1,40,01/20/14,"A friend took me to this restaurant to have lunch this afternoon while I am visiting Singapore. Good food being served there. Very authentic. I went there in the evening with my wife in the evening in the same day. We has deep fried oyster and lobster. Very well prepared food. If there are four of you, I would suggest ordering a crab dish. A lot of visitors around is ordered this dish but since there were just two of us, we ordered lobster."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,A must on a Singapore visit,1,40,01/19/14,"A friend introduced me to Long Beach and I recently visited with colleagues. I'd been building it up all day and the food and staff didn't disappoint.We started with the geoduck clam sashimi and soup bowl, followed by mango chili grouper (which would be my last meal on earth), chilli crab & black pepper crab. All were out of this world. Only downside was the noodle dish which was a little gluey. Staff were very attentive and friendly without being pushy.That being said, it was pricey and we'd probably be a bit more reserved on the next visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Signature Singapore Chilli Crab,1,40,1/9/2014,"This long established seafood restaurant has this outlet in an old colonial style bungalow opposite the Botanic Gardens. There is live seafood displayed in water tanks. All seafood dishes are nice, particularly the famous Chilli Crab--a must try !"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,To complete my 3.5-day trip in SG,1,40,1/1/2014,Disappointed by our visit to Jumbo the very first evening me and my hubby decided to try out probably one of their biggest rivals before we leave. Eventually got the chance today on our final day here and we are so pleased that we did. The staff were very friendly and proactive making suggestions being very flexible so we ended up with a set meal for two with chilli crab instead of black pepper and additional buns for dipping :)) the crab was really good and my hubby's favourite was the noodle which can't remember the name. Dessert came out with really cool presentation and we both stuffed n couldn't finish it all as it was a big meal probably enough for 3! Overall very good dining experience and would highly recommend. However there is always room for improvement...such as offering some bigger napkins to cover the front...also the ladies needs some serious refurbishment! 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab,1,50,11/19/13,"Had a recommendation from a friend from Singapore that when in Singapore we should all go to Long Beach Restaurant at Dempsey. Well we did and as there was 6 of us we all fought it all to get as much of the Black Pepper Crab as we could. yea it was GOOD. Very Peppery but isn't that how it was meant to be. Great Service, cold drinks, good food, and restaurant was packed (which always tells you something) What more could you ask for."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,One of the best seafood Chinese,1,40,11/10/2013,"Nothing to complain about, brilliant service quality Chinese food beautifully prepared and, when you order fish such as Sea Bass you see it whole cooked prior to it being shared out in bowls for each diner. We were six plus a toddler. Beers plus softs plus a bottle of ok wine plus food service and gst 300 dollars. Good I'd say "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent!,1,40,11/10/2013,"What a difference getting a private room makes! We had a party of 10 this time, and the service in an air conditioned room was exceptional. Food is perfect, as always, prooer crab to die for, and the rest to match. There was a snag with the restaurant running out of bibs, but they came to the rescue with some linen towels that perfectly protected our light shirts from flying cracked crab parts."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food and service has long has a beach.,1,50,10/27/13,"What a spread of sea food. From Jeo duck to alaskan crabs. You take a fixed meal and you are served with a whole spread. Dont miss the black pepper crab, it was out standing. Oh don't forget the mango pudding with the dry ice smoke. What an effect. Over all an excellent. Good meal not to forget. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Tremendous seafood with Friends,1,40,09/13/13,"I enjoyed dinner with nine Chinese colleagues at an outdoor table. The staff did a good job accomodating a few last-minute friends joining us. The food was served family style and we had a great time. We had one of the multi-course prix fixe menus, along with a few additions. Black pepper and white pepper crab, fish, noodles, rice and veggies - all presented well and very flavorable. Enjoyed coconut juice served in the coconut."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Awesome chilli and pepper crab,1,50,9/7/2013,"It is about 10 years since we left Singapore and moved to Europe, and we have missed the chilli crab and black pepper crab at Long Beach, their Dempsey location being new to us.We had a chance to revisit it tonight and it was wonderful.Peppery, tangy, buttery and spicy, rich flavours that cover your taste buds, hands and chin, with rice buns to soak up the sauce on the chilli crab, balanced with various Chinese greens and all washed down with a jug of Tiger beer ... Bliss !I specially brought a shirt of many colours to handle the inevitable splashes, but the staff kindly provided us with large bibs.Service was attentive and helpful, and the area which was the old army barracks when we lived here, has been transformed into a host of different restaurants and food types for all tastes and budgets.It was even better than we remembered."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Loved the seafood here!,1,50,08/28/13,"OMG, the chili crab and pepper crab here were absolutely amazing. Fantastic. I could have eaten every meal at this restaurant. My h travels on business to Singapore - and his Chinese speaking work colleagues took us here for dinner. Dempsey is a great little area full of busy restaurants, fun to walk around. There was quite a line at the restaurant - luckily for us, the colleagues got there well ahead of us. And ordered. I don't know what they put in their chili crab but it was addictive. Totally addictive. I wish I could make that at home. Black pepper crab was also great. We had the spare ribs which were very flavorful and had a beautiful texture. One of our hosts ordered a whole coconut as a drink - which seemed unusual but was actually pretty tasty. Just be careful to get the right utensil to dig out the coconut - or you might end up wearing the coconut milk!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great pepper & chilli crab,1,40,08/18/13,"The crab was extremely fresh, cooked to perfection with tasty sauce.
Tip: Be sure to ask for the weight of the crab before you order, as the price is market price set for that day. Otherwise it could become expensive."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Consistently good,1,40,8/10/2013,Every few years we visit Singapore and this place is always on our list. It never fails to deliver the best Sri Lankan Popular Chilli Crab dish with bread--over 1kg for S$68. You don't need anything else---well maybe a Tiger Beer or two!!!!!! Sit inside in the air-conditioning.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab and Chili Prawns,1,40,8/3/2013,"My husband travels to singapore frequently, so when I got the opportunity to join him he said we had to come to Long Beach Seafood on Dempsey Road for the black pepper crab. I really loved the area around the restaurant and the food was really amazing. The seafood is so fresh it's swimming in tanks before you order it. Was quite busy on a Thursday night, and reservations are highly recommended, although we found that the locals were given priority over everyone else regardless of reservation or not. When we were sat it was at a very odd table in the corner by the front door, and we waited over 45 min for someone to come over to take our food order. We flagged down the hostess, who was very apologetic, and she got someone to come over and take our order right away. Despite this, I think the locale and the food were well worth the wait."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good food,1,40,7/12/2013,"Was there with my colleagues from all over the world (26 of us) last night. Service and food was good, but a bit pricey especially the drinks and beers. The seafood was freshRecommended dishes and my favourite were:-1. The steamed live prawn2. The steamed live spring water golden phoenix Fish in Sintang style3. Famous Black Pepper crab - crab was fresh, but i didnt like the strong pepper taste4. Fried you-tiao with fresh crab meat and minced live prawn5. Supreme roast chicken"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great for crab!,1,40,7/2/2013,Chili crab was great! One tip would be to go all out and use your hands! Ask for a bib as it can get messy. Also had the beef with chili which was very good too.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,BEST LONG BEACH I've ever visited ever!!!,1,50,06/17/13,"Good:-Staff are professional & helpful!-Staff do not upsell.-Outdoor seating is good, despite the heat.-The annex has ample sitting space.Bad:-Main entrance has limited aircon tables.-Not possible to accept last minute reservations, due to high traffic.-10% rebates given if you are a member."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Chilli Crab.... more more more,1,50,05/22/13,This was a recommendation from someone who eats here regularly. Thank you so much. Get a cab and visit when in Singapore or if like us you are on a stopover between flights. Chilli Crab and Black pepper crab to die for. The wine list is not bad and if you are staying in a Singapore hotel will seem like a bargain. Will stopover again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Wonderful typical place for the pepper crab!,1,40,05/21/13,Very typical restaurant well located in Dempsey Hill. Very convenient place as you can find a lot of bars in the same quarter to go after dinner. The pepper crab is just perfect and you have a lot of choice of dishes. The service is very typical too and it's sometimes difficult to be understood if you don't speak Chinese. 
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Seafood in town,1,50,05/14/13,"It may not be possible to get to eastcoast all the time. Dempsey is turning into an upmarket wine and dine area. Long beach keeps it's menu at affordable prices similiar to it's eastcoast branch. The food is excellent. Outdoor seating is nice but there isn't really a view. The restaurant is very popular with tourists, business visitors and locals. Reservations are highly recommended. For those of you who enjoy Durian, there is a Durian stall near the open car park near the entrance of Dempsey road. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Chilli Crab!,1,50,04/14/13,The restaurant was very busy but the staff were helpful and efficient. We didn't have a clue what to order having recently arrived in Singapore but the waiter (Jeff) helped us and we a lovely meal and memorable evening out - we have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Food - Service,1,40,4/11/2013,Good restautrant and great variety of Seafood including Fish through to Alaskian King Crab..Reasonable price as wellFound sitting inside a little noisey so would suggest you sit outside if you want volume at a normal level.If you want the Private rooms make sure you boook in advance as we missed out
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black pepper or Chili Crab so many decisions!!!,1,40,4/9/2013,"Plenty of other food to choose if Crabs not your thing, but they do have one of the best in Singapore. They also will crack the crabs and get the meat out to save you the hassle. But the taste of either Black Pepper or Chili is a Singapore must try. I've tried it in other countries and it is still better in Singapore.Fried rice was a bit on the greasy side. But the fried green beans are fabulous! Reservations are needed for dinner any night of the week, lunch is easier to go in without a reservation."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Worth the visit to Long Beach @ Dempsey,1,40,4/9/2013,"It was an adhoc decision to try out the chilli crab at Long Beach. There were no tables available when we reached there and we had to wait for about 25mins or so for our table, we were a bit agitated at first due to the long wait. However the moment we were seated, the service was excellent, we were approached by this lady call May Lim to order and she's so considerate to ensure we don't over order since there were only 4 of us. We ordered the famous chilli Sri Lankan crab, deep fried squid, stir fry baby kailan and a simple fried rice. The chlli crab was excellent! It's my first time tasting Singaporean chilli crab and it's really really delicious and the crab meat was solid, perfect dish to go with the fried mantou. Even the deep fried squid was really good too. The supervisor May Lim will check with us whether the food is good and ensure everything is ok, very good service indeed. Will definitely recommend people to try out this place."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood location,1,40,4/4/2013,"If you want to have a good selection of seafood with a decent quality in Singapore, choose this restaurant. We really enjoyed it for the second time now, especially the crabs (chilly and black pepper) . It's nice to sit outside, do not have to suffer from air condition. Service is good, prices I guess average for restaurants in Singapore, but the food is really worth it."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great Crab, but Service could have been better",1,40,1/9/2013,"Went there just before the New Year as we had visitors from Oregon. We have been to Long Beach Dempsey at least 5-6 times in 2012 and the food has never disappointed. We also like the more laid-back feel of the entire Dempsey area, an area we frequent constantly.Black-Pepper Crab : Finger Licking GoodBamboo Clams in Garlic : AwesomeSteam Prawns : Very fresh, hence the lack of need for any condimentsCuttlefish Dough Fritters : A little greasy, but was goodFried Noodles : Good flavorFresh Mangoes for Dessert : Wolfed down in a blink of an eyeNo visit to Singapore is complete without a Singapore Seafood Meal, and Long Beach is the place we will always take our guests to."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab- gives you a reason to live!,1,50,1/6/2013,"If Moliere is correctly quoted by Samy, the South Indian eatery nest door ( see reviews) he probably was thinking of the Black Pepper Crab at Long Beach. They claim to have invented the dish, but if that is a stretch they certainly did perfect it. This is one of Singapore's iconic dishes, deservedly so. I come here for crab and only Black PepperbCrab. No starters, no side dishes, just delectable crab washed down with a jug or two of Tiger.Come here, or to the original location at East Coast Parkway. You'll be thankful you did."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Famous local seafood restaurant in Singapore,1,40,12/25/12,"I usually went to other seafood restaurant in East Coast or No Sign Board in Singapore.Latest trip to Singapore about 10 days ago, had a group dinner with colleagues at Singapore office after company business meeting. Haven't heard of this previously, but it was worthwhile visit if you are a big fan for famous Singaporean black pepper crab or curry crab.I have to say it was a finger licking great meal that I would surely visit again :-)"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Get the Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab!!!,1,50,12/4/2012,This is a must visit while you are in Singapore - the Pepper Crab and Chili Crab are simply the best here. Service is a whirlwind but efficient. This place just does it right. Feel free to put on the cheesy apron and dig in!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Amazing meal,1,50,11/28/12,"We had an absolutely fantastic meal at Long Beach. From the soup - crab sweet corn - to the honey chilli chicken and everything else we ate - it was just fantastic Special mention to the pepper crabs and the oysters. Oh my god ! The next time I am in Singapore, I know where my first meal will be ! "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great black pepper and chilli crab,1,40,11/25/12,"A jug of tiger beer? A few crabs? And a nice relaxed balcony. What more can you ask for?We ordered 2 crabs, a black pepper and a chilli. Both were amazing, the vote was split but best vote went to the black pepper. We almost ordered the Alaskan king crab (deadliest catch style) but at $600 we decided otherwise. also had some bok choy, prawns and some donut bread things that went very well with the chilli crab sauce. No one was hungry afterward, always a good sign for a crab house. A must do for seafood eaters when visiting Singapore. "
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Only for grab,1,40,11/10/2012,"Can't really comment on any other dishes than the grab in black or white pepper sauce or with chilli but that has been my reason to re-visit the place for many times.Imported grab is quite expensive but since the visits have only been on special occasions, it has been worth the money.The service is propably not the most efficient and despite always reserving in before hand the reservations have been lost or not in particular section of the restaurant (on patio) but usually the confusion has been solved and the over all experience has been good."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Spicy, in the heart of Singapore; If that's what you are looking for, this is the place",1,40,10/28/12,"This place is an Esau one to access without suffering the heavy traffic jams towards the East Coast, and food is as good. And food can be very spicy too, for those who love chilli crab and pepper crab and the likes, this place does meet expectations. The area at Dempsey hill makes it a pleasant venue to have dinner and move afterwards to another place for a drink and perhaps a bit of live music.The sits outside on the balcony are pleasant, no air con however served by fans. It is perhaps a better location than inside, as you feel the age of the place much more."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best View in Dempsey,1,50,10/11/2012,"It is the large deck that largely makes this Seafood eatery better than its nemesis inside. The seafood is equally good, and the seating choices are more varied. Try the salted fish fried rice."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,So good!,1,40,09/21/12,"Crab was Outstanding, as were the noodles and vegetables. Paired with some Tiger, it was a perfect meal."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best Chili Crab with mantou and Cereal Prawn!,1,40,9/11/2012,"I had the best crab this trip, I can't get enough of the chili crab with mantou that you dip in the gravy, the cereal prawn is the best! With white wine, our meal is the best. It is so much better that they renovated and we were given a table outside.. Nice ambiance.."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The best pepper king crab ever!,1,50,08/28/12,"Do you want to try to eat a huge crub? well this is the right place!1kg crab for few euros. We went there in 7 people. we ordered 5 king crab, 2 portions of prawns, 3 portions of oysters, wine, beers, dessert. In total we spent around 60€ each. Not cheap, but if we would have eat the same in europe the price would have been at least the double."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Succulent Crabs,1,50,08/24/12,Hosted a party of eight to a wonderful seafood dinner. The chili and black pepper crabs were plump and sweet. The frog legs perfectly spiced with a touch of garlic and the sea bass steamed in Thai seasoning melted in your mouth. Staff very attentative with ice cold mugs for the Tiger beer. Outstanding
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Good Atmosphere,1,40,07/24/12,Sat out side on a balmy evening. Very attentive staff who managed our large group well. Good chilli crab and a variety of spicy chicken dishes and accompaniments. Mid range for prices for food and alcoholic drinks. An enjoyable evening.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best crab in town,1,50,07/20/12,"The whole package is simply excellent. The food, service and location are reason why its for me the best crab restaurant in Singapore. There might be better place for the food somewhere at a street place, but the location and the staff cannot be beaten. Very recommendable."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great seafood! Chilli crab is top notch!!,1,40,07/19/12,"Dempsey is a fun location to visit for a drink and Longbeach the perfect place for dinner with family or friends. Promises a fun night out! Drinking beer, eating chilli crab... A wonderful summer night. The recommended special prawns were tasty, the vegetables pleasing and the chilli crab a standout. Great dining experience!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Delectable,1,40,07/17/12,"This is a seafood restaurant about 10 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road. It specialises in mudcrab, with chili or black pepper. Make a booking and get there before 6.00pm as it is very popular with the locals. It is not a food hall place so please dress respectably. It standards and quality are way above places like Newton Circus which is living off its tired old reputation for seafood. Dont waste your time going there.It has a mainly outdoors setting and you would think you were in a national park as it is so quiet.The seafood was delectable and we concentrated on the chili and black pepper mudcrab dishes.You wont be disappointed."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Seafood lovers' paradise in a central part of Singapore .,1,40,6/7/2012,"Menu includes lobster, Live Tiger Sea Mantis with Spicy Salt and Pepper, Live Drunken Prawns with Brandy & Herbal Soup, BBQ Live Nilotica Red Fish, Renowned Crispy Duck, Claypot Live Marble Goby and best of all is the crab dish which is served in many varieties including the popular chilli crab."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Black Pepper Crab is the Best in town!,1,50,6/1/2012,"We headed over to Dempsey Hill for some famous Singaporean Crab. Dempsey Hill is basically a village of sorts filled with restaurants, a few bars, and some shops catering to expats. We heard that the Long Beach Restaurant served up “the original and the best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore”. How could we go wrong? We ordered that along with a couple side dishes. Their Black Pepper Crab was phenomenal!! So spicy, so messy, and perfectly proportioned! I highly recommend this place. http://www.internationalnabers.com/2012/05/25/great-beers-found-in-singapore/"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Just as good as ever ...,1,50,04/25/12,"This was my favourite restaurant when I worked in Singapore a few years ago. At that time it was in Marina Bay, now it has moved to Dempsey Road. It didn't disappoint. The friendly staff, excellent service and brilliant food were all in evidence as they had been previously."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,As good as Jumbo if not better...,1,40,03/25/12,"The bet is on. Longbeach or Jumbo serves the best pepper crabs? Either way, customers WIN. Long Beach has a more laxed feel when you eat as its dining areas are in the main aircon restaurant, on the verandah (outdoor but with a roof) or just below the verandah (outdoor in brollies). Going to dinner give your guests a feel of working up an appetite as they climb up the little hill of about 30 steps. Thanks."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great experience,1,40,02/26/12,"We had been told to have Chilli Crab when in Singapore. Long Beach @ Dempsy was quite close to our hotel and reception recommended it as being good sea food. We were not disappointed. It is a very busy atmospheric restaurant and we thankfully booked before we went. They did say they only had garden tables left but when we arrived we were offered a table indoors which we decided to take. The service was excellent and the waitress very kindly helped us with the menu, which we found rather confusing. She gave suggestions and made sure that we didn't over order, which is so easy when you are not sure of portion sizes. All the sea food is completely fresh coming out of tanks. We had the house speciality prawns, suger pea shoots in garlic followed by the Chilli Crab and fried buns, a kind of sweet bread. We drank bear because the wine was too expensive."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Fun atmosphere, informal style",1,40,02/25/12,"Nice informal setting in which to kick back. Good food, efficient but not terribly friendly service. Chili crab the star!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,This is the place to try Chilli Crab!,1,50,02/21/12,If your in the mood for seefod and want to try Chilli Crab (or Black Pepper Crab) this would be the place I'd recommend.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,The real thing,1,50,01/19/12,"We lived in Singapore 35 years ago and Singapore Chilli Crab was an all-time favourite that has now traveled the globe. In recent years the dish has become overshadowed by the salt and pepper crab and other varieties but if you want to try the traditional masterpiece--this is the place to come. Ask for the Sri Lankan crab --about $58 Sing--and a serve of the steamed bread---that's all you'll need with a Tiger Beer--heaven!!!!!! The Dempsey Road location is 5 minutes taxi ride from Orchard Road, so you don't have to venture out to the East Coast."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Attentive staff & great food,1,50,1/12/2012,"Caters well to non-seafood eaters, vegetarians , worth a visit."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Black Pepper Crab!,1,50,1/4/2012,Best black pepper crab in Singapore. Lovely sitting in the garden. We go back time and time again.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Best Pepper Crab in Singapore,1,40,1/1/2012,"Good location, pretty good prices. They also do the crabs for you if you want."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Excellent seafood in cozy ambience,1,40,12/15/11,Long Beach @ Dempsey located at quiet place but when you enter inside it is quite crowded. Menu offers excellent seafood Singaporean delicacies. The one we tested was Singaporean crab curry alongwith Tiger beer. You can sit outside or book an independent room for small group. The service is very prompt and friendly. Overall wonderful dining experience in Singapore.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love it!,1,40,11/22/11,"Having been away for more than 8 years, I am glad to see that the food here is still very good. Portions are large and the service staff are wonderful about advising you on how much to order (or in my case, not order). Restaurant is in a good location with indoor and outdoor seating. They do accept reservations, which is necessary, especially on Friday evenings and the weekends. Service is good and it is obvious the servers have been well trained to wait patiently on customers. However when the restaurant gets crowded, then service tends to be spread a bit thin."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Bring a towel!,1,40,11/20/11,"We just got back from having a great evening. We were two couples dining. My husband had been here before with business associates. We had the drunken prawns, black pepper crab (2) and order of fried rice with prawn, a bottle of wine and 2 beers and it was $122 Singapore dollars per couple. The staff was extremely nice and we learned that the rice or noodle is always brought at the end of the meal. The crab is very messy to eat and we knew this so we brought a hand towel from our hotel for each person. They don't give you napkins like we are used to, but they brought us plenty of wet naps and finger bowls. If you request they will do the ""live"" drunken prawns at your table. There are lots of fish tanks in the restaurant. The flavor of the black pepper crab was delicious. It had a smoked bbq flavor to it. And we all got plenty messy. But, that added to the flavor of the evening!This was a meal not for prissies!! We all had dark ""gunk"" under our fingernails. I would return as it was just a really great dining experience. Fun was had by one and all!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Dining place...,1,40,11/16/11,"Dempsey is a great dining spot in Singapore and there are quite a number of restaurants here. We came here for a seafood lunch and our choice is Long Beach @ Dempsey.My favourite food here is the Black Pepper Crab, Claypot Rice Noodles with Crab and Lobster with cereal.Its a great dining place, lots of greenery and trees in Dempsey. Feel a world apart from the concrete jungle of Singapore !!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Great tasting food, but service very questionable!",1,40,11/12/2011,The Crab here is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted on the IslandAmbience is ok - view of Holland road in the backgroundYou have to be careful as they try and sell you too big a portion of crab.. and it is fairly pricey.. but it tastes so good...Service from the waitresses is bizarre - they just dont seem to care too much and couldnt care less that your there really - quite snotty and we dont really care attitude.. but that was my and my friends impressions but it didnt really spoil the food (reminded me of China town in Sydney!)Tables/quality is very average - just a notch up from Hawkerish.. not classyBut despite all this the food was great and that is what we went for.. so I'm giving this place 4/5 and it would get 10/10 on Food!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Fresh! Lots of Choices,1,50,09/27/11,"Really, really enjoyed the food! All was fresh and excellent and we had quite a variety of dishes. Mostly seafood. Drink service was attentive. Food delivered to table as it became ready, a little dis-orienting for people used to typical US service (appetizers then entree). This was the best tasting, best quality food I had while I was in Singapore."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,BLACK PEPPER CRAB - TO DIE FOR,1,40,9/6/2011,"First time visiting this restuarant and we tried a variety of differnt Chinese dishes which were good, but the black pepper crab was outstanding and highly recommended. Will definately come back again."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Authentic Seafood,1,40,6/5/2011,"Probably one of THE places to go in Singapore for Seafood. It has the feeling its been established quite a while, more Raffles than Clarke Quay. Enormous, yes, faded yes, authentic, yes, crowded yes (reserve!), expensive (can be). Crabs are the the speciality and flown in fresh from around the world so not exactly ecologically sound.Ten minutes by taxi from Orchard outside the rush."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Love the Black Pepper Crab,1,40,4/5/2011,This was my second visit to Long Beach (last one being in August 2010) and I was not disappointed. I came for the Chili Crab & the Black Pepper Crab and I've decided I like the Black Pepper Crab better. The crabmeat was so sweet and not over powered by the seasoning.
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Great Sea Food Restaurant - Recommend the set menus!,1,50,10/15/10,"I was in Singapore hosting some customers and was recommended this place as a good place to take them. That was a great recommendation. This place is great!Since we had a group of 10 people I booked a table and ordered a set menu in advance (lucky we did too, as people were queuing to get in). Our menu included Bamboo Clams, Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Roasted Chicken, Fish (not sure what type), Tofu, Noodles, Fruit (and perhaps something else) and it worked out at about S$80 a head (including quite a few beers - buy the big tiger draughts). I think that was a bargain. The food was great, especially the black pepper crab. The atmosphere is really nice, and eating there in a group is actually a lot of fun with the rotating table. My one criticism was that service got slower as the night went on. But to be honest we were having a nice time so it wasn't a big problem. I thoroughly recommend this place, and next time I am in Singapore I will check out one of the other branches of Long Beach."
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,"Yes, the white pepper crabs!",1,40,10/6/2008,"Yes, the white pepper crabs!"
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,their white pepper crabs...,1,40,06/17/08,their white pepper crabs is fab
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,You MUST try their white...,1,40,05/24/08,You MUST try their white pepper crab!!
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,Alaskan king crabs go for about $400 each *sigh*,1,40,5/4/2008,Alaskan king crabs go for about $400 each *sigh*
Chinese,LONG BEACH @ DEMPSEY,I go there all the time...,1,50,04/27/08,"I go there all the time, by myself or in groups. The seafood there is reasonably priced, but expect no frills service, or even very slow service. Also always check the bill, they tend to get it wrong often."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great service.,1,40,06/14/18,"Not the cheapest place to eat but if you want to feel really special then this is one of the best places to eat at. Staff terrific along with the food. Expect to pay around $180.00 for a few dishes and drinks. Only let down is the price of beer , wine and coffee. Understand about the taxes on alcohol but $10.00 for a coffee does not make sense. Regards David B"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Flambeed Chicken but advanced order required,1,40,04/22/18,New Chef Edward Chong has some strong signature dishes which require advanced orders: Tomahawk steak done Xinjiang style (3 days advance order required) and flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine (1 day advance order).Winning dish: flambeed Chicken with Chinese wine is a must try!Other noteworthy dishes:Prawns with passion fruit sauce was succulent with a good bite and refreshing sweet sour passion fruit flavours. Beef short rib with truffle oil & black pepper was excellent with tender Wagyu beef & a fragrant truffle nose. Tofu with lala has a nice “Wok Hei”flavour. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Possibly one of the nicest lohei I’ve had,1,40,3/9/2018,"Invited to a business lunch for CNY and was impressed by the lohei ingredients, abalone/salmon/shrimps all in! The crispy silver bait fish was extremely tasty and refreshing strips of pear inside the lohei really made it my top fav of this cny must-have dish. Generally the food my host picked were all impressive, the braised pork belly, assam fish head.. except for the oxtail stone rice which I personally didn’t really enjoyed. Would probably try their tradition dim sum the next round. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good food. Nice ambience,1,40,02/24/18,"Had CNY dinner set menu. Great food, and good service. Had a good view of fireworks during Chingay Parade. Portions are quite good and lobster in lemon sauce was the best dish and praised by all the guests. Even roast chicken was very well done, crispy skin and succulent meat. Steamed fish was also fresh and tender. The special fruit yusheng was very refreshing with a variety of fruits but was a little too sweet with the dressing."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Enjoyable lohei dinner at Peach Blossoms,1,40,02/15/18,"Visited with extended family members and ordered a substantial feast comprising yusheng, a giant steamed marble goby, roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork with lychees, braised tofu in crab sauce, vegetarian sharksfin and glutinous rice steamed in lotus leaves. Dessert was yuzu cheesecake from the coffee shop on Level 4. Everyone enjoyed the meal. There was so much food we had to take away some of the rice and the dessert. The yusheng was a Marina Mandarin specialty, comprising fruit and salmon - really worth paying a premium for. We used a dining voucher which shaved about $300 off the total bill. Final bill was about $600 - a steal, given the food was of good quality and was for 11 pax."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Chinese it is a yes from us !,1,40,2/4/2018,"It was a Sunday night 8pm and no reservation.Although the restaurant was really full girl at the desk was very helpful and found us a table .Our waitress Mun Fung was very helpful and I enjoyed mandarin Mojito with out the sugar and a glass of Kapuka New Zealand wine by the glass .We ordered the live pan fried prawns in oriental sauce , sensational multigrain fried rice with chilli and seasonal vegetables fungi and garlic .All in all a great fresh Chinese meal with terrific service Yes we would come back "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Truly Cantonese Cuisine,1,40,01/22/18,Had lunch with some friends yesterday (21 Jan 2018) and had Dim Sum with some other dishes. There were 7 of us and the bill came to around $420. Seems pricey just for a dim sum lunch. However food was good.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Celebrating my Son's birthday ,1,40,01/19/18,We have been coming back here every year for birthdays and anniversaries celebration. Their high quality of food and services have been consistent.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Traditional Cantonese cuisine, and Creative Dim Sum with a modern twist.",1,40,12/23/17,"Peach Blossoms Located at #05-00 6 Raffles Boulevard, Marina Mandarin, There are abundance of great Cantonese Chinese restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the Peach Blossoms in Singapore is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. It is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant that's found a home at the Marina Mandarin, with tastefully ambience, unique blend of warm and cool tones, and a modern, sophisticated very comfortable place where you can enjoy an authentic fine dining experience. It is a distinctive but good up-market Cantonese fine dining restaurant with Good service, and tasty harmonious food. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. One of the dish that really stand out was the Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel Chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth! .The restaurant also offers a Weekday All-You-Can-Eat Dim Sum lunch buffet .The price tags are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality fine dining Fusion Chinese cuisine. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great Chinese Fusion,1,40,12/22/17,A late family dinner at Peach Blossoms was a great experience. A wide range of chinese fusion foods together with a long list of beverages. Excellent customer service. A bit pricy but worth the experience. Crispy squid and wasabi prawns were signature dishes. Dessert too were fantastic. 
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful place for a group or family meal,1,50,11/30/17,"Spurred by good reviews on this site, a group of us went to Peach Blossoms for dinner. The location is great with potential views of parts of the Singapore skyline (not the best parts though) and the pretty Marina Mandarin interior hotel lobby. Menu is extensive (and expensive), service excellent, and interior decor attractive (but not romantic). Place was full of groups/families; didn't see couples. Food was very good. Try the avocado/chocolate ice cream dessert to conclude your delicious meal. Strongly recommend reservations."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Birthday Lunch,1,50,11/26/17,"Had a birthday celebration with my grandpa & relatives at peach blossoms marina mandarin. What an experience! Food is good.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Quite an exclusive Chinese setting with suiting ambience ,1,40,8/6/2017,Wonderful Chinese fine dining with assurance of freshness and skilful cooking. The starter was great with a good mixture of cold dish. The Peking duck was well prepared. The service staff are friendly and efficient. Just felt sad to notice that the Shark Fin soup are still on the menu of this relatively well known Chinese Restaurant in Singapore. Maybe the management could be more conscious of the rampant killing of the sharks.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),One of my best meal in a Long time ,1,40,7/12/2017,"With my friends who's mum was in the hospitality business. This family goes from from good restaurant to another awesome restaurant. You name it .... this family would have been there. Tonight, it was peach blossom for the first time. Why ? I asked my friends. Both brothers, both so much into good food, wines & whiskeys. They were here to give support to their new manager, Alden Gan. He was with another Szechuan restaurant before joining this joint.This is twice in a month for them visiting the restaurant. We kicked start la la (seashell congee) with black fungus. It was an excellent soupy dish. Next comes, the Yong Tau foo. Wasn't bad as the minced pork on the bean curd had a touch of salty fish which I really like. Fried asparagus was good but the coffee pork ribs were so good. A must ... here.Wagyu beef was next, wasn't bad followed by shiitake & mushrooms, really vegetarian n seriously very tasty too.My friends were loving the Wagyu beef so much that we had another order to what everyone's appetite. Next dish surprised me ... Cantonese cuisine n their special this month was the black flat Hokkien KL style noodles. It was superb. Very very good indeed. I would have finished the plate myself, tasty n reminds me of good Hokkien mee over in the state of Kuala Lumpur.Desserts of jelly & beautiful moon cakes were served. A good night & definitely I will be back with my other friends.Service was awesome. Restaurant manager, Alden Gan just made me a satisfied customer who would drop in again any time soon. 9.5/10 for food.10/10 service.9/10 ambience. "

Thanks!,1,50,7/2/2017,"Had my Solemnization luncheon here on 28 June 2017 and being served professionally by Mr. Alden Gan & his team who has provided my guest and I a very comfortable luncheon experience in Peach Blossoms (Lotus Room). Despite a slight shock to my nephew due to the waiter who accidentally drop a plate from his tray to the floor, and perhaps personally I felt that the soup was slightly salty for me. Nevertheless, the great service with delicious food and its overall ambience compensate it all. Initially we booked at 12 pm, but due to some circumstances we arrived early to the restaurant at 11.15 am in the midst of setting up the room, but Mr. Alden & his team done their best to speed up and set up everything nicely and allowed our guests to enter around 15 minutes later! Amazing! The dishes has been distributed and served individually for the convenience of our guest. We ordered a customized set meal which served 7 dishes with 1 dessert. The black chicken soup starter was delicious! Loved the Peking Duck too, was hoping for more though hahahaha! Great Mango pudding dessert! Thanks Mr. Alden & team!Summary- Food taste: 4.5 / 5- Food presentation on each plate: 4.5 / 5- Ambience: 5 / 5 - Table setup: 5 / 5- View from Lotus Room: 5 / 5 (Thumbs up! Overlooking Shenton Way.)- Room size: 4 / 5 (Slightly cramp for two big tables for 22 pax, but its still great!)- Service: 4 / 5 (Slight delay on the serving of food, in coincidence there was another private lunch too, thus the waitress & waiter have to served both rooms.)- Price: As stated $$$$, but worth it!- Overall: Deserved 5 / 5 and highly recommended for private functions!"

The food was delicious and staff was very warm and friendly.They helped with the Peking duck so presentable with the side sauce. The rest of the duck meat cooked with dried chilies and cashew nuts – bot crispy and tasty! Other dishes includes vegetables with scallops and tang hoon was refreshing with a unique clean clear taste. The ostrich meat was tender and nice, and the Fried Rice recommended by our waiter was a “WOW” – DELICIOUS!We had dessert – glutinous rice with ice cream and avocado with ice cream served o dry ice flowing. So impressive! Both refreshing and delicious. Then come the longevity buns… it came with a big plate of beautiful wordings and read out cheerfully by their staff Christine. What a sweet gesture! The buns were so delicious that we ordered another 10 to take away!We enjoyed so much that we forgot to take photos of the food. We learnt that the figurines made from flour by one of your staff Terry after his working hours! So creative and Impressive! He said it takes about 7 days to solidify – a charming souvenir indeed!We would like to thank Terry, Jeff, Alden and Christine for making our mother’s birthday dinner so unexpectedly memorable. This place has simple hidden charm.. and we would love to come back may times again!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Where guests become friends,1,40,03/31/17,"The Husband (he has been given an upgrade) and I brought his family there for his father's birthday celebration. Expectedly, the food was flavourful and did not fail us. But what really got our notice was their service (or should I say, relationship) to their diners.Frequent diners, I assumed, were called by their first names. One service staff even remembered a diner's birthday had just passed.That weekend saw many diners celebrating their loved ones' birthdays. We heard a birthday rap done by a service staff and wondered if it was only for that table.Nope! We got a birthday specialty too - a birthday poem penned by the manager, with a figurine to boot. Apparently, Peach Blossom's assistant manager goes the extra mile by making these flour figurines for diners on his day off from work.Overall, it was an engaging and lovely dinner. Thank you Terry, Nobel, Bowei, Sook Teng, Akira, Mun Fang and of course, Christine for the warm service. See you again on 9/4/17 (i am so sold on their service that im bringing my family there soon).This is so not a paid advertisement!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exemplary Service from Restaurant Manager,1,50,03/17/17,"Booked the place for dim sum lunch under the Meritus card voucher - giving me 30% discount for food, a bottle of wine and a cake. To my dismay, I was informed the voucher cannot be used for the buffet dim sum. My pre-selected white wine, Sauvignon blanc, was also not available at the restaurant as they only serve Chardonnay. Both were not told to me when I booked the restaurant via the card concierge. Fortunately, Mr Alden Goh (Restaurant Manager), noticed our unhappiness and turned the situation around. He explained the terms of the voucher and although the restaurant does not carry Sauvignon blanc, he made arrangements for us to have it (instead of the Chardonnay). He also made sure that we are well-attended to throughout the lunch. Although, we still could not take up the buffet dim sum - took ala carte, the food was of good quality and the entire dining experience went really well. I must say that the service we received is exceptional, thanks to the exemplary service from Alden. Thank you!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Memorable Dinner at Peach Blossoms,1,50,03/14/17,"Wanted to bring my parents and elderly relatives for a good Chinese dinner and Peach Blossoms was undoubtedly my #1 choice. As usual, we left delighted after yet another highly satisfying meal that had everyone beaming from ear to ear.The ongoing Peking duck promotion was excellent value for money, especially when you take into account how succulent the duck was compared to many of its competitor's offerings. The other dishes were equally scrumptious and divine as well and spoke volumes about the restaurant's pride in their craft. The quality that distiguishes Peach Blossoms from the rest must be the superb service of its staff led by restaurant manager Alden. Alden's warm and personable style ensured that everyone had a comfortable evening of laughter paired with the thoughtful food recommendations he made.Thanks to his trusted suggestions, our entire dining party (both young and old) got to enjoy a delectable mix of dishes that catered to all our tastebuds.Another memorable evening! Thank you Alden and Peach Blossoms!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Instant service from ALL available staff,1,50,3/7/2017,"First reputable restaurant where we got service from practically every staff who passes by. And it was from the manager to staff servicing other diners. The service started with the staff who settled us down and continuously came around to top up our tea cups and change our side plates to the manager who was passing by when we asked him to add some Tim Sum to our meal. Which he did immediately by writing them down and punching the order into the computer. We would have loved to order the a la carte Tim Sum buffet but it would had busted up too many diets. Just go and try it out. Better still stay in the hotel like we did many years ago, go back to the suite to drop everything after some shopping and wash up a little before going for a meal at the restaurant. Don't sign the bill to your hotel account as they always have credit card promotions on a la carte meals."

The decor has been tastefully designed to provide a hint of the Chinese court yard, without feeling like you're in Disneyland. The service is so discreet ,polite, and helpful in making suggestions. But it the food that takes center stage here. Its creative, visually stunning and most of all, delicious. Do not come if you are on a diet; you will only torture yourself. It is impossible to resist asking for seconds and third servings."

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Nice but not Wow,1,40,11/13/16,"One of the good Cantonese restaurants in Singapore with ‘prestige’ ambience and professional service. It has never scored below 7.5 in my personal scale of 1 to 10 but also never above 9. This meal proved no different.Unlike the last time, I was a guest and therefore did not choose the meal. I probably would not have chosen what my host chose given that there were only three of us. To start, she chose ginseng oolong tea. Crisp with only a slight after taste of the ginseng. The only problem is that it does not go well with all dishes and clashed with two dishes in particular. Stock to the Imperial Pu Er or have it at the end of the meal.We started with mushrooms in white truffle oil. I do not like truffle oil at the best of times (though I would make an exception for the lobster and glass noodles at the Imperial, Asia Square) and the oil did little to highlight the subtle ‘fifth’ flavor of the mushrooms. The crispy roast pork was very good. Dry to the touch, moist underneath with no fatty after taste. The jasmine tea smoked chicken clashed badly with our tea but the other two did not seem to mind. Maybe I am too fussy. Because of my decision to no longer eat things that are or could be endangered, she gave the shark fin and birds nest a miss. Instead we had the restaurants’ version of Monk Jumps over the Wall. It is notoriously difficult to get right but at this meal it was the standout dish. The steam fish, whilst good, was too much after the sensory and stomach overloading soup. The braised rice vermicelli with fish and bitter gourd again clashed with the tea. However, the coconut pudding with its three layers and unconventional pairings of different parts of the coconut left me again revising the meal upwards again. 8 out of 10 methinks."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good service,1,50,11/12/2016,"Good service there and would definitely recommend it to my friend. Staffs there were very friendly and nice,I would definitely like to go there again:) "

The dishes were really tasty. Also it was my mum's actual birthday and manager Terry actually offered to provide her with ??, what surprised us was how intricately the birthday dish was displayed with handmade flour decorative items and written with really meaningful chinese words. Thanks Christine for being so enthusiastic with us in taking the photos as well! We really had a wonderful dinner last night :)"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),B.d lunch.,1,50,11/7/2016,"Made a reservation through Terry. Was there for my b.d lunch with family. We got ourself a nice seating next to the wine rack. The ambience was nice and comfy not too loud and was quite relaxing to be able to hear the birds chirping outside. The staffs were extremely helpful and observant to details. The foods tasted delicious and were well presented, my recommendation goes to the soya sauce chicken.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Fantastic dim sum, great service",1,40,10/30/16,"I decided to bring my family to the dim sum buffet in Peach Blossoms, since it has been a number of years I last patronised the restaurant. The decor remains the same, and the service remains great. The dim sum buffet was quite different from the one three or four years ago. For one, they have a trolley that carries several popular dim sum dishes from which you can choose from. Secondly, they offer a select range of choice appetizers you can choose from (one choice per diner). So you get to try abalone, lobster, sharks' fin dishes in the buffet.Choices are abundant in this a la carte buffet. You can choose main courses, porridge, noodles, rice, djm sum, soup and even desserts. Since it's a buffet, you can order dishes any number of times. Portions are not small, nor are they huge. The food is also not too oiley. I didn't get the bloated feel after the meal.The buffet is available between 11:30 and 3 pm. It's a good deal, for a person at $58++. Children below 6 years old are free. Great to try if you will like to!"

The service was impeccable and he and Christine devoted themselves to our room, introducing each dish and course as it came and them serving individually, while at the same time ensuring that our drinks were always filled.The food was excellent. The soup was a clear double boiled consommé with free range chicken and was really flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the garlic roasted chicken and the korobuta pork chop was spectacular, with every delicious morsel melting in the mouth.After dessert there was a birthday cake placed on a large plate on which was inscribed a Chinese poem written personally by Terry, who also incidentally personally arranged the flowers on the plate. All in all it was a memorable dinner which my father hugely enjoyed. Many thanks to Terry and Christine and we will certainly return!"

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Mother's Day Dinner,1,40,5/12/2016,"We ordered from the ala carte menu and we felt that it was more valued for money than the set menu. We had cod fish for many of the dishes and I must say, the food was fresh and definitely tasty. The only pity thing is that the portion is too small, even the large portion was too small for a table of 11 + 1 child. Food was also served very slowly. Although it allowed us to have ample time to sample the dishes, the serving pace could be faster. Would not mind going back for another meal to try out some dishes which I did not have a chance to order."

To cap off a wonderful dinner, the dessert was served on a plate calligraphed with a chinese poem honoring our visit and there were two figurines of the 'monkey and goldfish' carved out of dough which were crafted by him personally.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent place for dinning,1,50,1/8/2016,We were there 2 days ago. Good food. Delightful ambiance. Very high standard of service displayed by staff. Managers Alden and Terry were there to make sure that everything was running smoothly. We were very impressed and enjoyed our meal there.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Great Service, though can be expensive",1,40,1/8/2016,"Dined here with a few friends and the service is very warm and hospitable. They allowed me to use my Mandarin Lifestyle voucher which granted me 35% off and a free bottle of wine, plus a 500g cake. However, the cake needed 3 days advance notice (which the voucher didn't mention) and I will have to collect swing by again to collect the cake in future. On first glance, the menu is quite expensive and their premium selection of teas also feels a bit too expensive, but the great friendly service really makes up for it. the staff were very attentive and were prompt in changing new plates, topping up our tea and water and were helpful in suggesting dishes and recommendations. The trio of meats were really nice (char siew, soya chicken and roast duck) and we also ordered half a peking duck which they used the meat for a fried mee sua. The crispy roast pork was also very well done and paired with the mustard sauce, was very delicious. For the negatives, in one of our dishes, home made tofu with seafood, one scallop was completely off and the waitress gladly gave us a replacement dish of prawn with wasabi mayo. That was good customer service and generous of them. In this day and age, I also expected sharks' fin to no longer be on any menu, but they still had it on as a premium item. I hope they will end this unethical dish and stop serving it in the near future. Overall, after using our voucher, dinner came up to be $35 per person and we were really full and happy with the food and service. Hence, without the voucher it would have been $50 per person and that's still a very reasonable price for fine dining chinese restaurant. We'll definitely come back!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Still Good,1,40,1/5/2016,"Whenever we have a meal at Peach Blossoms, whether just 2 persons or a dinner event, the staff, Nobel, Bowie, Vivian, Jeff, Terry, Sook Teng are always patient with our requirements and changes, trying to accommodate our requests.

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Exquisite Ala Carte Dim Sum Buffet!,1,40,08/26/15,"For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/08/ala-carte-dim-sum-buffet-at-peach.htmlThe service here was not so good. No one attended to us to take our drinks order after we were seated for around 5-10 mins - We have to call for them. There were quite a few times we couldn't find any staff nearby us to place our food order whereby the restaurant was only half-filled. As this restaurant has 3 sections, they should assign 1 or 2 staff at each section to standby since this is a 5 star hotel. Most of the staff were not with any smile too except one of them was good.I would like to highly recommend their Steamed Honey Glazed Pork Bun! So far Peach Blossoms has the BEST Char Siew Bao as the skin was so so fluffy that no other hotel chinese restaurants can do it. And the filling was not too sweet. Overall it's melt in the mouth!Overall their food quality was quite good, slightly higher than other 5 star hotel chinese restaurants that I've visited, except some of the dim sum and their dessert really needs much improvements! If only the service can be warm and better, this place will be perfect. I felt that with this price of SGD58++ per person for only 2 hours buffet during weekend is quite rush. Most people would rather go for Jade@Fullerton at only $38++ with free flow tea for about the same dining hours."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Beijing Duck was superb,1,40,08/20/15,"We ate there on our first evening in Singapore and were not dissapointed.
We were well explained and advised, and the food was good.
Expensive, especially the drinks, as everythere in that area."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Great variety of food and service,1,50,07/16/15,Service was prompt and the staff was very attentive. Great tasting food coupled with nice ambience. An overall great and satisfying experience. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),High quality dim-sum,1,40,7/10/2015,"Came here for yumcha and dim-sum on a Sunday. The food here is at high quality, for us coming from HK also felt the dim-sum here is of very good standard.You have stunning view of MBS while enjoy your meal. Price is expensive and portion is small, as expected in a top 5 class hotel. Size of dim-sum is tiny. Recommend for business lunch or a good treat for family."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious beef and shrimps,1,50,05/26/15,"We ordered their specialties- beef wagyou and prawns with wasabi and mayo. The beef was tender and cooked just right. It had lychees which was unusual and heightened the meat's flavor. The prawns were big, topped with roe and were equally delicious. Fried rice with fish roe completed our meal. Even the jasmine tea that was served was good quality.Since we are staying at Marina Mandarin and it was raining, dining here was convenient. The setting is similar to most high end Chinese restaurants. We did not get to enjoy the view as mentioned in other reviews. Our table was far away from the window. Nevertheless, it was a very good meal."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lunch at peach blossoms,1,50,05/16/15,"This is an excellent place to eat lovely ambience, great food and exceptional service staff must mention Nobel who is gem among service staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant to all of the people I know. "
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Delicious wasabi prawn & soft shell crab,1,40,04/25/15,"Ate dinner here with my team. We ordered a couple of dishes which included this fried soft shell crab and wasabi prawn which was really really good. The ambiance was typical fine dining Chinese resto, service was ok, but what won me over were those two dishes. Would come back to order them if ever I am in the area. The place is good for both family and business gatherings."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Food and Excellent Service,1,50,03/25/15,"Came to dine with my family and ordered a few dishes and it was excellent! The Multigrain Rice and 3 Eggs Spinach are my recommendations, loved the textures and flavour of the rice.Service is great and the ambience is really relaxing with the wooden decor. Would recommend others to come and will definitely be back soon!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Cantonese food,1,40,02/26/15,Food is good but service is spotty during Chinese New Year period. We have no issues with the food nor the pace of food being served but the staff are simply too overwhelmed to be able to remember other requests.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),So much that is excellent let down by little things,1,40,09/27/14,"This is now our 10th meal at Peach Blossoms, at least, since we often stay at the Marina Mandarin Hotel when in Singapore. We love the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the ease of access when staying at the hotel. Everything is excellent except they let themselves down with easily fixed logistic errors.First they serve all the dishes so quickly without warming stands that you feel under pressure to eat quickly so that the dishes are still warm when consumed. All they need to do is have warming stands or to be prepared to serve dishes in a sequential order.Second, we ordered a bottle of wine and each time our glasses were empty we had to ask the waitress to serve more wine - either be more attentive, have a dedicated sommelier or place the wine bucket beside the table so you can self-serve.Prices are confident but not over the top considering the quality of the food. All in all a good dining experience that could so easily be a great dining experience if they paid more attention to the details described above.David C"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good Cantonese restaurant in a cozy atmosphere,1,40,7/9/2014,"The restaurant is actually pretty small but it creates a cozy atmosphere and you ask for a table by a window, you'll get to enjoy a very nice view of the Singapore skyline. Overall, the food was really good and the service excellent. I highly recommend the wasabi prawns. The only trouble is actually how to find the entrance to the Marina Mandarin hotel from Marina Square Shopping Center!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Restaurant for good food, atmosphere and reasonable price",1,50,06/19/14,"The look of the restaurant from outside is quite interesting including inside when you walk in. The seat is comfortable with varieties of foods to choose. I am during the abalone promotion with abalone set menu. I enjoy the taste of the food here. Furthermore, staffs are very friendly and help you with all the description of the food. I might suggest the soya chicken, abalone and soup.the price is quite reasonable compared with the food we ordered. This restaurant is quite highly recommended to visit."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),nice even for sets,1,40,06/14/14,"I had the set lunch there, had low expectations as it was not ala carte but pretty decent , nice sweet and sour pork. Roast duck and chicken combination was great too. However, didn't rate it a five as it is rather standard fare though well prepared, no special differentiating factor that caught my attention. Service was efficient and the decor was great, worthy of photographs; nice view of the harbour and not too cramped like the restaurants in the malls, space is a commodity in singapore. Would recommend if you are avoiding the common noisy chinese restaurant."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent,1,50,03/22/14,"Went there alone but the staff was very helpful in making the selection. They even adapted for my taste the Wagyu beef by replacing the longan with asparagus. The seafood rice was outstanding too. Yes, it is an expensive place but that is kind of expected."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Excellent Situation Management,1,50,3/3/2014,"Not quite a crisis, but it was an unexpected situation that excellently managed by the restaurant staffs and making things amicable for the diners.I was having my birthday dinner at the restaurant on 2/Mar, just as we have started the dinner, suddenly some lights went off and next to minimum light source, by then the restaurant staff informed us there was a fire on the same floor and restaurant kitchen need to cease operation right away, so our dinner have to be discontinued. The staffs quickly offered us to dine at alternate restaurant on the next floor, so that the celebration will not be affected.when we got to the next floor restaurant, everything have set up for us nicely, complimentary wines were provided as a gesture for the inconvenience caused. best of all, we also need not pay for the meals....a wonderful way of customer relationship management.Like to place on record for this commendable action by the restaurant staffs."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Feedback on Food & Service,1,40,1/9/2014,"First of all, I need to highlight that items that I ordered are all in Individual portion. Food is served in per plate per pax. I was puzzled that presentation and serving of food was all served together! First came my soup, Almond with Fish Maw Soup very quickly follow by appetiser Soft Shell Crab w Salted Egg which is fine. Quite immediately after appetiser is served came Peking Duck with Foie Gras, by which time we were struggling to drink the soup, eat the crab and Peking Dark. And the rest of dishes follow suit. When Wagyu Beef with Longan arrive, I was quite annoyed and displeased and told the server to please hold the dishes till we are almost done with at least 70% of what is on the Table. As by which time there are about 8 plates for 2 diners.The last dish Seasonal Veg with Abalone was still served immediately despite my my request to hold dishes till we clear the table.Being Chinese myself, I understand if I order the dishes as a whole plate to share...it's definitely fine to serve few dishes all at one go.But with an individual pax serving..I think the server should have an eye for details ie. be prepared or standby the kitchen when guests is almost done with one of the dish before you present the next. I think it's a normal dining standards for restaurants like Peach Blossom. . The manager who took our order was friendly and cheerful. But the Service staff were kinda impatient...giving that can you help to make way for these plates I'm holding??!!! Service standard was not exactly good as compare to food standard.The bill was $230 for 2 pax. It wasn't exactly a good dining experience."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good Food Good Service,1,40,12/18/13,"Signature dishes like wagyu beef with longan and wasabi-mayonnaise prawns continued to be very good. Service personnel were very courteous and professional. We couldn't decide on the choice of noodle or rice. Service attendant politely recommended their one of their specialty fried rice, which was a very good choice. He also asked if we wanted the dishes served at the same time (like typical Chinese family meal) or one after another (like Western meals).Restaurant ambience was good - background music didn't overpower conversations, window view of MBS, S'pore Flyer, Mandarin Oriental Hotel & sky made the restaurant bright and wide (not claustrophobic) & pleasant Chinese decor.Complimentary parking is available when dining payment is S$50 or more."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Lovely Ambience with birds chirping,1,40,11/9/2013,"We had lunch. The dim sum was very nice with quite a good variety. I don't eat meat, but friends I was with had the Peking duck and it was good. The meat dim sum was also very good.The service is excellent except the uniforms should be looked into. The slim waitresses look very good in them, however the plump and shorter waitresses look terrible in them and there was even one waitress that had a split near the zipper and was walking around without even knowing."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Wonderful food,1,50,10/18/13,"This is an excellent restaurant with wonderful Chinese food, with a more modern approach and dishes you rarely find in other countries. Although this is in an expensive hotel, this was very reasonably priced provided you do not choose wine."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),PEACHY,1,50,09/27/13,Lovely food & ambience. The menu is extensive & there are also set menus for those who can't decide. The real birds outside in the atrium sing for you during the daylight hours - just enjoy!
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Best starter,1,50,8/9/2013,"This restaurant has such great Chinese vegetarian dishes, but what really caught my attention was the free appetizer pickles given as a complimentary starter, I think the best pickled vegetable dishI have ever tasted. I asked for three bowls of it, and was graciously granted willingly with a smile. I would have been happy with that and rice, but am glad I had three other vegetarian dishes which were delicious. Nice ambience. Great service."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peking duck a must have!,1,40,03/17/13,"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Peach Blossom provides contemporary chinese cuisine in a nice quiet setting. I strongly reccomend a party of 4-6 people as any lesser, you wouldn't be able to order an assortment of dishes enough to compliment your palate. To start off, the soft shell crabs in salted egg yokes were delightfully cripsy. It's also not overly salted and the egg yoke coating wasn't soggy either unlike many Chinese eateries. Next up, the Peking duck. It cost about $70 per duck and serves about 15 servings of tiny little crepes packing in the fragrant duck skin, cucumbers and the delectable sauce too. It is unlikely u would stop at 2 crepes. The seafood fried rice with salmon roe was delicious too and to think we polished our bowls thoroughly even towards the end of the dinner is a compliment enough for this simple but tasty dish."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin",1,40,12/6/2012,My first dinner upon arriving in Singapore when I entertained three ladies from my old school. I did not choose the meal but it was very good and I believe we all enjoyed it.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Fine dining indeed,1,50,10/10/2012,"Soft shell crabs, which are difficult to cook without being oily, I always regard them at a test of a true chef, and boy I've been served some horrors. Here they, as was all the food of the highest standard and truly succulent, service was creditable and we would have to give it a massive 10/10, and we never have gone over 8/10 even at our favourite comfort food restaurant, congratulations to the management and staff, they rounded off a wonderful day"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very good food and staff,1,40,08/28/12,"We stayed at the Marina Mandarin for two nights and the restaurant was recommended online.The menu was varied and slightly confusing regarding cost per portion/person.The staff were very helpful in choosing, in serving and in attention to detail. The food was very good, some of the best scallops (chinese style) I have had. For a higher end restaurant with good service, the value was good."
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),"Good dim sum, great staff",1,40,08/23/12,"Am sure there are better dim sum places but because my husband and I didn't have enough time to hunt for one and we were also hungry, we decided to eat at peach blossoms since we were staying in the same hotel anyway. Surprisingly, the dim sum was really good... Not a wide variety but taste was very good... We also had noodles with chicken along with a selection of dim sum, best one is the steamed pork in soy sauce with chopped red chilies! I love spicy food and this was our fave!!!!"
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Peach Blossoms,1,40,08/20/12,Food and service very good...atmosphere was great.....but expensive and drink prices a little over the top
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),The best dim sum I have ever had,1,50,7/11/2012,"I would come and stay at the marina mandarin just to eat here, the dim sum buffet is incredible, and the choice staggering!

Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Good quality Chinese dining,1,40,05/23/12,The quality of the food was matched by the service.
Chinese,Peach Blossoms (Marina Mandarin),Very elegant dining,1,40,10/18/11,"I thought the atmosphere was very elegant and the food very good. I had one of the Set dinners which consisted of several courses. The wait staff was very attentive and each course was served and allowed the proper amount of time before the next. It is pricey but I found the experience to be very enjoyable and memorable. There is surely food to be found that is as good and at lower prices elsewhere but for elegant dining that will make an impression, give this a try."

My Uncle liked yam in general and they gave us really good yam based food recommendations.What’s really awesome was that I had requested for peach (lotus bun) for my Uncle and they really prepared it for him. The decorations for the peach was beautiful - and it’s complimentary :) Service is really great!Food wise, it was really delicious! Some food recommendations that I have here are:- trio meat ( roasted meat, pork belly and duck meat).

French,Angelina_MBS,Drinks and light dinner,1,50,4-Sep-18,We walked from the Esplanade to MBS after attending a concert. The walk took us along the floating platform and the Helix bridge. Weather was good for walking. Decided to take a drink and light food at Angelina. We settled for a bottle of Italian pinot gris which was recommended by the captain. It was fruity and good with the food we ordered. We had a club sandwich and a Ceasar salad which were excellent. Service staff tried hard to provide good service. We enjoyed our drinks and food. 
French,Angelina_MBS,Lunch! Nice service! ,1,50,13-Mar-18,Nice food with tea. This place is less populated so it was a good choice. Delicious and easy on the stomach. Not oily. But I wish they’d serve more salad.
French,Angelina_MBS,Delightful bistro coffee shop in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall Singapore,1,40,13-Mar-18,Angelina is a small intimate and very high quality coffee and pastries cafe in Marina Bay Sands shopping mall Singapore. The bistro cafe is raised above an indoor water feature and has comfortable seating and a high class feel. Very tasty macaroons and cappuccino. Service was slow even though it was not busy. However I was in no rush and really enjoyed this cafe coffee shop.
French,Angelina_MBS,Bonjour,1,40,16-Oct-17,"A French restaurant serving good high tea, pastries and dessert. Great ambience and quiet setting. :)"

French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian Chocolate Style,1,50,16-Feb-17,It's a must place to visit for a chocolate lover.

But I will definitely spare my time to visit this place again when I got the chance to visit singapore. Can't wait to go back!!
French,Angelina_MBS,Excellent Service,1,50,9-Feb-17,"Excellent service (consider we have a toddler with us). The food was great. Compare to Paris's Angelina, The hot chocolate is a little bit more creamy but still, we had a great experience in Angelina Singapore"
French,Angelina_MBS,Dinner for two,1,40,2-Feb-17,Atmosphere was very good. Scallop with black rice dish was really very awesomely unique. Signature monc blanc dessert is a tad too sweet though and truffle fries was so so. Tea selection tasted great.
French,Angelina_MBS,French in a classy way,1,40,3-Jan-17,"Most diners visit the restaurant for coffee/tea and desserts, but I actually enjoy their main course more. During one of my visit, I ordered their macaroons.. perhaps it was pretty late that the macaroons have been in the dessert counter for too long, the macaroons served to me were so tough that i had difficulty biting it. Unforgettable experience!"

French,Angelina_MBS,"Average food, good dessert",1,40,27-Nov-16,Had the beef steak and the seafood risotto. the beef was bland and the sauce didn't match at all. risotto was ok but the seafood had no taste. We ordered the opera cake for dessert which was very good. Would go there again for dessert.

French,Angelina_MBS,French desserts!,1,40,31-Oct-16,"I first got a taste of Angelina in Paris and is pretty stoked that there’s one here in Singapore. The French patisserie at Capitol Galleria, Stamford Road, boasts an impressive array of desserts - you won't know which to try first!For the chocolate enthusiasts, their Choc Africain is a must-try. Drown your tastebuds in its chocolate-y goodness, and come back for more"
French,Angelina_MBS,as good as in Paris?,1,50,26-Oct-16,The hot chocolate is a must try - it is as good as the one you would taste in Paris.The service - better than in Paris. The Paris cafe is always very busy and staff seems under great pressure.in Singapore it is not that busy and the staff is really service oriented.
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for Dessert & Drinks,1,40,23-Sep-16,"Love the ambiance of the place.
However it's pretty pricey.
Didn't have much choice of desserts but the taste was not disappointing"
French,Angelina_MBS,Good food worth a visit,1,50,4-Sep-16,"I visited Angelina with my mom. We ordered a soup, 2 mains, opera cake and the signature hot chocolate drink. The signature hot chocolate was very good. The complimentary olive bread goes well with the butter. The food was tasty but a bit pricey. We plan on visiting soon. Location was good as it is easily accessible by bus or train."
French,Angelina_MBS,good food and desserts,1,40,30-Aug-16,"very good french food - flavourful, perfectly cooked. praises all around from our table. desserts were also exceptional.just wish staff were a bit more flexible. wanted to change hot chocolate from promo to the iced version because it was a hot day and they were of same value but was firmly told no because POS system only registers hot for the promo. at least was given a cup of ice but only after much persuasion."
French,Angelina_MBS,"It's not Mont Blanc, it's Flore",1,40,16-Aug-16,"This review is for a visit I did some time back in Dec 2015. Went there with a group of friends for lunch.Obviously we didn't go to Angelina especially for lunch. We were after the Old Fashioned Hot Chocolate L'Africain. Before Angelina Singapore, we need to go to Paris to taste this cup of heavenly chocolate but now it's available near us!I personally enjoy the thick hot chocolate, served with the chantily cream. It's still heavenly, though a friend of us complained a bit that the Singapore version is not as good as what she remembered from Paris.Tried the Pan-fried Scallops on black venere rice with shellfish cream. Scallops were nicely cooked, but I find the whole dish to be too much on the salty side.I almost gave Angelina the average 3 stars rating, but for one thing, I decided to give it 4 stars. It's for the flore. The bright red dessert --- combination of raspberry, meringue, white chocolate, and vanilla mousse --- is one of the best I ever tasted. It is a truly a beautiful dessert. Maybe this is my personal take. Angelina's signature for me is not the overly-sweet Mont Blanc, but the beautiful Flore. I hope they will never take it off the menu, ever."
French,Angelina_MBS,Very Pleasant,1,40,14-Aug-16,"Had a lovely pot-Au-feu there last night. And scallops and black rice. It's pulot hitam for those who understand. But done with a seafood sauce. Quite delicious. The cakes with ok, but could have been better presented, as they were about $14++ each. We had the Mont Blanc and an opera. Service by Hamiz was good. We had a nice table. However most of the other tables were really tiny. More for just drinks, I guess."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great for lunch ,1,40,28-Jun-16,"It was a good catch girlie lunch. I had the beef cube not sure why they name it beef cube when it's a steak. It was done medium rare exactly what I wanted. Real truffle fries, highly recommended. The chicken breast was not dry as well though I order the beef! Service was good too. The attentive staff pro actively brought a cushion for the baby chair. Nice gesture! "
French,Angelina_MBS,A little bit of France in Singapore,1,40,20-Jun-16,"As a French person having lived in Singapore for 6 years now, it's nice to have a touch of home from time to time. Angelina delivers this with it's Parisian theme. It's also located in a convenient place (Capitol Piazza), which makes it a good go-to place for a break in the middle of the workday, or for weekend brunch. I've been there several times, and it is always a pleasure to share a Mont-Blanc with a friend, and to enjoy their absolutely scrumptious hot chocolate. The main difference is that in France, Angelina is mostly known only for its hot chocolates, teas and pastries. But here in Singapore I tried out some savory dishes, including the Truffle ravioli, the 'Pan-seared duck foie gras', and the pumpkin soup - a good range of dishes from light to hearty. It is also very pleasant to see that the Angelina Team is warm and welcoming, not always easy to find in Singapore - or in Paris in fact! I would definitely recommend Angelina for fellow foodies looking for a tasty lunch or dinner, or a sweet treat."
French,Angelina_MBS,Lovely place,1,40,5-Jun-16,"The place is small but I quite like the Parisian feel, although typically in Paris or Europe, the tables seem more far apart, which gives you more privacy. I'm not sure. We had the brunch set. The coffee was alright, hot chocolate was pretty good but a little rich, pastries were good but rather common. The smoked salmon was alright and the half boiled eggs were fun to eat it from the tiny egg holders. The french toast with caramel sauce was a little too much of carbo for me but you could choose the other which I can't remember what it is. Overall, it was an enjoyable brunch, but I prefer somewhere else if it's only for the food. There are better brunch/breakfast elsewhere. I will still consider returning to try their main courses next time. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Interesting dessert,1,40,3-Jun-16,"I had the signature Mont-Blanc at Angelina. Meringue, light whipped cream, chestnut cream vermicelli. Enjoyed this interesting dessert."
French,Angelina_MBS,Awesome Service,1,50,1-May-16,"Love the ambience, furnishing & decoration... No complain about the food & service... All has been perfect from the moment I step in till I leave... Will definitely patronise Angelina again... ??"
French,Angelina_MBS,Brunch so good,1,40,22-Apr-16,"We were looking for a good place for brunch and I saw Angelina appear on one of the food bloggers' recommended places. We didn't even know there's Angelina in Singapore!:) So we decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed. First of all, j'adore les croissants and pretty much any kind of bread, to be honest, so I totally dug the basket of fresh breads that came with our brunch. The omelette was soft and creamy, a perfect complement to the smoked salmon I ordered with it. And last but definitely not least, the thick and creamy hot chocolate is exactly what yummy dreams are made of. Perfect it certainly was! We will be back for sure!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Sweet sweet experience,1,40,21-Apr-16,"Fantastic ambiance, very high end restaurant. Went there for a late tea/supper/dessert after dinner. First time there and the waitress is kind enough to show us an illustrated menu of their desserts to give us an idea of how the dessert looks like, Excellent service. Pastries was great, had no chance to try their beverages thou. Would definitely go back to try."
French,Angelina_MBS,Superb afternoon tea,1,50,11-Apr-16,"Excellent service, good food! Praticularly the foie gras. The pastries were good but not extraordinary but the full experience was superb. This is the only Angelina outside France, take advantage and bisit Angelina SG!"
French,Angelina_MBS,"Phenomenal food, excellent service, memorable ambience!",1,50,26-Jan-16,"I had the pleasure of luncheoning at Angelina's recently. What a find! Their truffle ravioli is the perfect rich, velvety comfort food that I'd like to drown myself in after a long day (and might I mention one of the nicest I've tasted in Singapore).The service was impeccable, the ambience makes for the perfect parisienne experience (complete with the essential street-side people watching, even if it's in a mall! :)) The desserts looked sinfully delightful, except I was stuffed by the time they rolled around. But the famed hot-chocolate is on my list of things to try next time - reserved for rainy afternoon with good friends."
French,Angelina_MBS,"Best Hot Chocolate Drink served in a delightful, serious manner.",1,40,22-Jan-16,"What I love from Angelina is the Tarte Tout Chocolate. The crunchy praline biscuit and the soft dark chocolate ganache alleviated the richness of the tart, I couldn't stop savouring in each bite.The other signature of Angelina is the Old-fashioned Hot Chocolate “L’African”. Just like melted chocolate, smooth and rich, this was definitely not for the faint hearted. The portion came in an entire jug, but was served in smaller cups, accompanied with the whipped cream that complemented the cocoa drink. It was perfect for sharing among us.Read more at UrbanOutEaters to know more about my three times visiting Angelina.I always enjoyed my time and my meal at Angelina. Lovely venue, elegant and kind staff, delicious desserts and the best thick hot chocolate served in a delightful, serious manner."
French,Angelina_MBS,All that hot choco goodness,1,40,17-Jan-16,"It's that hot chocolate that would be worth going back to again and again. Thick, comforting, at the right temperature to sip without the singe, cacao wafts soothingly. Didn't add the cream but just ate it straight as if it were a dessert -- it was good cream on its own! Wary of the chestnut dessert as it was too sweet. Very accommodating staff on a weekend considering I had three extra guests on top of my original reservation for four. Staff even reassigned us to a nicer spot. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Enjoyable afternoon ,1,40,1-Jan-16,"Dined at Angelina twice this year 1) Dinner for 2 : good food, although a tad expensive 2) Tea w friends: great dessert (lemon cheesecake is very ""lemony"" which I love) and the Negresco. Great coffee. We sat upstairs and it was an oasis of calm & solitude amidst the busyness of being downtown. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Small piece of paris in singapore,1,40,8-Dec-15,"I know Angelina from Paris, it may not be the best of its kind, but it is still quite good. If you crave a thick Parisian style hot chocolate with decent whipped cream (hard to come by in Singapore) then this is the place. I also like their croque madame "
French,Angelina_MBS,"Great ambience, Fabulous food!",1,40,27-Nov-15,"Had dinner at Angelina solo. Ordered the pan fried scallops...The black rice has a taste reminiscent to our local dessert, the Pulut Hitam and eaten together with the shellfish cream and scallops. Awesome!The dessert I ordered is their trademark classic French pastry, the Le Mont-Blanc consists of chestnut paste vermicelli on top and whipped cream and meringue at the bottom. Fabulous but a bit too sweet!Basically, nice ambience, great staff and strongly recommended!Dr E. Chow"
French,Angelina_MBS,Expensive but Good French Food,1,40,14-Nov-15,"I tried their pork chop grill and shrimp pasta The pasta I wasn't impressed with, but the pork chop was great. Very tender and juicy. They give you complimentary still waterThe hot chocolate is a must try and best if you share it. A fair warning, the hot choco is very thick and fattening but it's worth to try "
French,Angelina_MBS,"Great Place, Great Food ",1,50,23-Sep-15,"I love the high tea time :) Everything is so yummy, just the price quite expensive but it's worth for me :) And the place located at Capitol Galleria, Singapore great building with lots of great place to eat. More please follow instagram : @xiaolingchan or @nyonyokecil "
French,Angelina_MBS,Parisian tea room and patisserie ,1,40,18-Aug-15,"Angelina's tea room and patisserie, has been a popular tea room in Paris since 1903. It opened a branch this year in the new Capitol Plazza, home now to luxury brands, Angelina's ambience was a bit disappointing. It was cramped, tables too near each other. We went to try their signature pastries and hot chocolate, to help a friend complete his Singapore bucket list. The hot chocolate was amazing and so was the Mont Blanc. But they're both rich and heavy so best after a light meal. We didn't try the mains. Like all trendy new cafes opening up here, prices are on the higher side. Service was pleasant "
French,Angelina_MBS,Amazing BRUNCH at Angelina Tearoom,1,50,18-Aug-15,"I was so thrilled when I first got wind that THE Angelina Tearoom from Paris would be opening a new branch right here in Singapore! I’d been to the Angelina Tearoom in Rue de Rivoli in Paris (for the curious, it is located near to Westin Paris Vendome). The kewl Tearoom with beautifully decorated interiors once played host to Coco Chanel and Proust who were regulars at the Tearoom. I was curious to know if the Angelina outlet in Singapore could match up to its parent.I’ve read many online reviews criticizing the slow service. Well, just so you know - I NEVER visit a restaurant/cafe/tearoom - during the first 2 weeks of their official opening. You need to give the staff time to be trained and get up to speed! I went after the 3rd week of their opening - on a weekend - at 12 noon and I wasn’t disappointed.It was crowded but they managed to get me a table. The tables here - especially for 2 persons is small. But the cafe brought out additional small tables to ensure that our dining experience would be noting but fantastic. We were served by an amazing waitress named Pamela. After the meal, I was asked to fill in a Feedback form. Needless to say, I gave Pamela and the team full marks for service and everything else listed in the form.I had a wonderful Brunch experience. It really is very value-for-money to have Brunch here. The Angelina Brunch is priced at S$39.00++ per pax and is available until 2.30pm - daily."
French,Angelina_MBS,A must in Singapore for Gluten Free,1,50,16-Aug-15,"It’s a little on the expensive side, but we had a wonderful dinner. Staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free. All in all it was a good experience."
French,Angelina_MBS,A little slice of Parisian Heaven,1,50,12-Aug-15,"On my recent visit to Singapore, I came across Angelina, a French café in the heart of the city, and decided to indulge myself! It took me straight back to my many visits to Paris. From the delicious hot chocolate to the decadent pastries. It was a great experience and would happily recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore! Oh and if you are a fan of sweet dishes then you must try the Mont Blanc, it’s to die for!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Probably the best bakery IN TOWN ????????,1,50,12-Aug-15,Superb service and suit my sweet tooth. Definitely recommending to family and friends. Best experience i've had so far.
French,Angelina_MBS,Bakery at its best....??,1,50,12-Aug-15,Awesome service. Delicacies was excellent. Friendly staff and helpful. Will recommend to family n friends definitly. Value for money as well...well located...
French,Angelina_MBS,Best Bakery ????,1,50,12-Aug-15,Excellent service and delicious delicacies. Will definitely recommend to my family and friends. Value for money. Will come back for more. Best experience ever.
French,Angelina_MBS,"A place for Sweet Tooth. (Long winded review, Personal experience)",1,40,27-Jul-15,"I been to Angelina twice.The first visit, was during their soft launch. I reached earlier than my friend and served by Joseph. He patiently introduced Angelina's signature dishes and desserts to me and I ordered his recommendation, Mushroom Risotto, Signature Hot Chocolate and Mont Blanc. I personally really love the signature Hot Chocolate and the Mont Blanc, YES, they are SWEET. I read some comments that the signature Hot Chocolate was not HOT. I would say the temperature of the hot chocolate was just nice to drink as a dessert, if too hot, I would not enjoy to continue one sip to another non-stop. (hehe...) I had requested to warm up my hot chocolate again after I finished my Mushroom Risotto. I love the signature Mont Blanc with meringue base, the ""thick"" chestnut puree wins my heart... It was so ""lovely"". The Mushroom Risotto was a bit ""too much""... Joseph saw my face after tasted the risotto, he stepped forward and asked for my comments. I told him, ""It was a moist and creamy risotto, but additional pine nuts had overtake the mushrooms' taste"". He immediately back to the kitchen and informed the chef my comments and asked me if I want to change the Mushroom Risotto to other main course on the menu without any obligations. (I was really embarrassing, I felt I am a picky customer.)Well, I would only say Angelina is too generous.That is really true when my friend ordered a Caeser Salad as she was on diet (Bad timing and she is not a sweet tooth person). When I looked at the Menu, I was bothering by its price on the menu, is at the higher side for a Ceaser Salad. But it is worthy, my friend was satisfied, the portion is enough for 2 person sharing, the ingredients is fresh and delicious. Overall : ??? 3.8Food : ???? 4.0Service : ???? 4.0 I'm aware they are young who probably less experience in F&B service industry. Give them a chance and they trying to do their best too.Atmosphere : ??? 3.5Great Location. But partially of the restaurant was high ceiling, it would be a bit warm during the hot weather especially in Singapore. Solid woods furniture, is grand but heavy. Limited space."
French,Angelina_MBS,Great place for Tea,1,40,28-Jun-15,"If you have an afternoon off, drop by Angelina . They have their famous Chocolate drink and great choux pastries . Very French !"
French,Angelina_MBS,A Little Paris in Singapore,1,40,16-Jun-15,"When I vacationed in Paris back in 2014, I stayed near an Angelina Paris Patisserie but never got a chance to dine in because of its queue. Now that we have one at the newly revamped Capitol Piazza, I jumped at the opportunity to check out its goods and validate its reputation.We were lucky to be the only ones in the queue on a Sunday afternoon. We also chanced upon an empty table by the sidewalk. The circular table was petite, to say the least and hardly meant for large meals. Luckily, a rectangular side table was put to good use. Water was served without us having to ask. The menu showcased their cakes, each piece literally a work of art; and also offered other dishes for a fuller and more complete meal.We ordered the signature Le Mont-Blanc (which solidified Angelina Paris' reputation ever since 1903) and the Tentation. As with all cakes, they were sweet and looked temptingly pretty. In fact, it took me all of 15 minutes before I decided to take a bite as I sat there admiring their designs.Service was good but not fantastic as they had to contend with the crowd, ever streaming in but not overwhelming so. At the end, its prices were not unexpected, but to experience a little Paris in Singapore, why not?"
French,Angelina_MBS,8 of us ,1,40,14-Jun-15,"We went as a party of 8. As the place is not big, if you have a big group like us, prepare to wait. We waited for 40 min before we were seated. Service was good despite the fact that they are evidently under staffed.We ordered 3 mains, 2 starters and 4 desserts. The sandwiches and risotto were Gd. The chocolate tart and the opera were my fav even tho Mont Blanc is what they are known for.Overall a gd place to laze around for an afternoon. "
French,Angelina_MBS,Morning pastry and coffee,1,40,14-Jun-15,"Coffee is average but cakes is quite tasty. Felt this place had a classical European touch.Nice environment and relaxed atmosphere. Recommended.. Best thing is that although the restaurant is full on a Sunday morning, you won't find it too congested. Recommended!"
French,Angelina_MBS,Debut,1,40,14-Jun-15,"A new French cafe @ the revamped Capitol theatre.
The service is friendly & prompt at the queue.
Ordering drinks and food is also a breeze with pictorial aids.
The breakfast menu is quite interest.
A must try are the pastries."
French,Paul,Delicious food in lovely ambience,1,40,5-Sep-18,"My wife and I had dinner at their branch in Tanglin Shopping Centre. We went there a bit early and there was no queue. I like the ambience very much - quiet and cosy. Service was good. The oxtail was one of the best that I've tried. It is also a bakery shop, selling a variety of bread and cakes."
French,Paul,Best pastries ever! Great place for a teatime date!!,1,50,4-Jun-18,"My boyfriend knows that I am such a sweet tooth so he decided to take me to Paul for a teatime date...I completely fell in love with the place! I LOVE the pastries! Best pastries ever!! Beautiful display of pastries, very attractive and colourful. The display sold me. The ambience was great as well, simple yet elegant. I had a hard time deciding on what to get but the service at Paul was wonderful. They were very friendly and especially patient with my decision making! Thank you for the excellent service. I would definitely come to Paul again with my boyfriend and even bring all my friends. I certainly had a wonderful date that day! Thank you so much Paul, and of course thank you to my boyfriend too!!"
French,Paul,SUPER FRENCH CAFE IN THE HEART OF ORCHARD ROAD,1,50,23-May-18,"Well done! Enjoyed the wide variety of food choices available! Good quality of French pastries and croissants. Delicious main course dishes and tasty healthy salads in menu; it is difficult to make a choice.Convenient location, A must visit place when in Orchard Road Singapore."
French,Paul,Friendly staff with ???? recommendation @ paragon,1,40,23-May-18,"Surprisingly friendly staff who attended to our table. I brought my parents for routine medical check up and decided to stop at Paul. It is the first cafe other than Toast Box as we walked back to paragon. My first time at Paul and I asked for recommendations. We had avocado scramble eggs and croque monsier to share. It is . Perfect for the elders as we requested for our food to be less salty. The friendly staff as well,was helpful to fill up my parent’s thermal flask with hot water before we left. Will definitely be back for the next check up."
French,Paul,Lunch at paragon ,1,40,23-May-18,"My lunch at paul paragon yesterday was super. The beef salad was really good. I simply loved the combination of how the beef was cooked, the refreshing asian dressing and the creamy avocados. My partner had the seafood pasta, seafood was fresh, pasta was cooked to perfection. The tropical blended drink was very nice as well. Service was friendly and attentive. We didnt have space for desserts Will need to come back again for yummy cakes"
French,Paul,very good pastries,1,50,22-May-18,"PAUL has the best selection of sweets. the quality is always fresh and consistent, service is fast and good. will come back here always for my sweet cravings"
French,Paul,"Great food, friendly staff",1,50,20-May-18,"Went there recently with friends, no doubt that the ambience was good. Staff was really friendly and helped us out with the food recommendation even though it seemed busy at the moment. Food was good and desserts were excellent..!! Love the terrace seats!! Will definitely recommend others!!"
French,Paul,Breakfast meeting,1,40,20-May-18,"I am a regular customer of Paul and i have patronise paul in many asian and european countries. I must say, compared to the outlets that i have visited in France, Malaysia or even back in my hometown Jakarta; Paul Takashimaya is definately one of the best.I had breakfast meeting for 8 people last week. We arrived earlier before the opening time and the staff on duty was pleasant, welcoming and accommodative. All of us agreed that everything from the coffee, crossiant, breakfast menu and desserts was magnificent. I personally had cafe mocha, eggs benedict and a mini crossiant. The cafe mocha was creamy, chocolaty and strong. The eggs benedict was simply matchless and the mini crossiant was buttery, fresh and tasted exactly like the ones i had in France. Service was extremely good and fast. Good ambience and easily accessible, i would highly recommend this to my friends."
French,Paul,Quality food; had an exceptional time @ Paul Takashimaya,1,50,20-May-18,Had a late lunch with my friends and decided to pop by Paul for some light bites. Staff was quick to recommend a few selection of appetizers and desserts after to try. We had the mango salad & beef tartine to share. It was exceptional. Had chocolate waffle & lemon tart after! Can’t believe how on point the staff was in her reccomendation. Will drop by again if I’m in the area! Thank you so much Paul Takashimaya :)
French,Paul,Top class,1,40,20-May-18,"Went to Paul paragon over the weekend last week, service and food was excellent! Though the place was crowded as it was the Mother’s weekend, service was prompt, food was Super good especially the seafood pasta and the desserts were to die for. Will definitely be back! Keep up the good jobs Paul Singapore!"
French,Paul,Nice environment with nicely done food,1,40,7-May-18,"It’s a nice environment to enjoy your lunch with your friends. I love the potatoes soup. Light & does not feel starchy at all. The Ham & Cheese Crepe is simple & yummy!! The service is above average. The price is on the high side. However, it’s worth the value. "
French,Paul,Great experience and great service,1,50,24-Apr-18,"My friends and I came to Paul(takashimaya) for lunch yesterday and we had a great time. Service was great,very friendly and cheerful service crews. Gave us great recommendation on food and even recommended us to awesome deserts according to our preference of taste. Their food is really good,both presentation and taste. Coffee was awesome, love the coffee in Paul. Not to miss out on their hot chocolate. Overall we had great time in Paul. I will definitely go back there. Thank you Paul."
French,Paul,Great food/pastry and friendly service,1,40,24-Apr-18,Been there for a few times for friends gathering over tea and dessert... love their dessert especially salted caramel tart & the purejee... tried their lunch too... nice and friendly place to dine... keep up the good job!
French,Paul,Extremely great service,1,50,17-Apr-18,"Brought my mom to Paul at Takashimaya for her birthday and had a great time there. Before I miss this out, the waitresses even went the extra mile to help me out with choosing the cake for her as she is a very picky eater and to my surprise she actually love the cake they chose."
French,Paul,Great service!,1,50,17-Apr-18,I am very pleased with the service that was provided at Taka. The staff was very prompt and helpful in helping me with my selections. Had a every pleasant experience and will definitely dine here again. Thank you!
French,Paul,It was unexpectedly amazing. Great customer service,1,40,17-Apr-18,Came over to Paul with my family for dinner. The beef burger was really good for its tender and juicy meat. We also ordered the new menu of the honey baked chicken thigh and seafood pasta. It was appetising and I thought it was great for their French restaurant to introduce these local dishes. Staff was friendly and we really enjoyed the meal. Would come back again!
French,Paul,Improved service,1,40,17-Apr-18,"Came to Paul over the weekend, tried the brunch. It was very good and value for money. Service has improved, server was very prompt, the portion was very generous and we really loved the burn orange ice tea"
French,Paul,the food was great i love the food,1,40,11-Apr-18,i love the food its something new in the menu like the chili crab pasta and the kaya toast. it was good i would recommand my friends to come and try out the new menu.
French,Paul,Goôd food and wine,1,40,8-Mar-18,"To be honest we only chose this restaurant as it was the only one in the Paragon Mall that served wine. Our meal was served quickly and I had the 3 sausages and mash with onion gravy, being a Brit I disliked the lamb and chicken ones but thats my fault. The staff were friendly but not overly attentive. Good atmosphere. 7/10"
French,Paul,An excellent shrimps salad,1,40,24-Feb-18,"It is a bar restaurant inside one of the many shopping centre of orchard rd.
What is interesting to notice is that this chain of bistro present also in others towns has a quality standard quite high."
French,Paul,Sit and Relax,1,50,1-Jan-18,"I have been to many PAUL outlets. In Westgate, Paragon and Takashimaya. Its a dessert heaven. They serve very good food and good service as well."
French,Paul,"Good for lunch on the run, nice decor, food very good.",1,40,16-Nov-17,"Upon approaching Paul in Ngee Ann City we were immediately met by staff who promptly found us a free table at a busy time of the day. A menu was quickly produced and the specials explained. We sought a casual light lunch and were not disappointed; the soup, filled rolls and beverages were very good. The atmosphere was humming as customers came and went at regular intervals. The inside ""dining area"" had stylish décor which added some class to a basically casual, quick stop venue. The staff were friendly and helpful at every turn, helping us with directions as we continued our retail therapy."
French,Paul,Ms,1,50,16-Sep-17,"Wow good food. I ordered pan fried salmon with 2 side dishes and it was really tasty and delicious. But it's more high end prices. Good ambience and easily accessible. Located at famous Takashimaya mall and near orchard mrt. Service staff short handed, need to ask 3 times for a glass of water to come. I enjoyed my lunch very much there. It was my first time to patronise the restaurant and I will go back again."
French,Paul,Always a great Sandwich at Paul Takashimaya ,1,50,6-Aug-17,"I had lunch at Paul today.
I had my Favourite Atlantique sandwich.
Nicely toasted with salmon in between and a cup of latte.
Wonderful food and service.
I think that this is one of the best Paul outlets in Singapore so worth a visit."
French,Paul,Perfect for a quick lunch,1,40,1-Aug-17,"Paul, an old name from France in the bakery business, has set up nice restaurants around its bakery products.Rich salads like the nicoise with seared tuna, excellent sandwiches with home baked bread, the bone marrow which melts on a perfectly toasted tartine. An of course a large choice of pastries for dessert.Decent wines by the glass, fresh juices and of course tea or coffee. Perfect for lunch but also for a lazy afternoon tea.And they have various outlets across Singapore"
French,Paul, always love this place...,1,50,13-Jul-17," me and the Mrs were here for a late lunch.. we both tried some new dishes on the menu.. i had the oven baked beef bone marrow with seasalt, served with tartine bread (check out my pictures) while the wife ordered the rack of lamb with rosemary. both are amazing. the bone marrow was excellent, rich and full of bovine goodness. i just wish the bread was slightly more toasted n crispy for the marrow to be spread on!! i would highly recommend the marrow...damn delicious!! "
French,Paul,Loving it,1,50,26-Jun-17,"Good coffee, good croissant, good sandwiches and macaroons if you are sweet tooth person. Black coffee with croissant, your best teatime buddy!"
French,Paul,Loved It,1,50,23-Jun-17,"Sometimes I just want a good bread roll filled with fresh 'stuff'. I loved this I went here twice, two lunches in a row while I was in Singapore. The baguettes rolls are chewy and fresh and I had the smoked chicken which was beautifully presented with a tasty side salad and nice dressing. The roll was filled with lettuce and tomato and had a really nice mustard mayo. The coffee...well the coffee is real coffee and excellent. Nice staff, great service and very relaxing. Good work."
French,Paul,An Oasis,1,50,17-May-17,"I stopped for a late morning coffee after some frenzied power shopping. Paul is an oasis of calm in the busy centre. The coffee is good, as is the range of European cuisine on offer. I will definitely be back."
French,Paul,Lunch,1,40,16-May-17,"Roast Rack of lamb , well cooked , tastes good, 3 pieces , just right for light lunch. Cappuccino with dash of hazelnut sauce was fragrant and slightly sweet."
French,Paul,Extremelty good service at the Tanglin Branch,1,50,12-May-17,I really really loved the service staff at their Tanglin branch. All of them are unassuming and sincere. They don't judge what you order or what you do not order or if you request for free water. Wait staff at the marina bay link outlet are not friendly and pass judgmental look when you do not order drinks with the food
French,Paul,"Food as tad salty, but otherwise super yummy",1,50,3-May-17,"My husband & I visited because of a promotion. I thought Paul's is more famous for its patisserie, but boy, was I wrong! I tried the lamb rack, bone marrow and escargot. They are perfect! The lamb is well marinated, a bit salty but very delicious. The bone marrow & escargot are perfect! My hubby tried the tenderloin. It's not too bad, but not as great as the rest. The atmosphere is quite good on a weekday, not too crowded - but maybe that's why there is a promotion. The service is also quite good. I'm totally visiting again real soon!"
French,Paul,Nice drink; helpful and conscientious staff,1,50,14-Apr-17,"Went in for coffee with a friend. Managed to forget my credit card behind. By the time I realized this, I called the place and was assured that my card was safe with them. When I went to pick it up, I wanted to offer a little thank-you gift to the person manning the register. But she declined saying that this is what they do for all their customers. Much appreciated, especially because I am flying out of Singapore just a few hours later."
French,Paul,Good place for coffee and pastries,1,50,28-Mar-17,This is my favourite new cafe to have a long black and palmier. Love the palmier and it's the best I've tasted by far. The set meal is reasonably priced and quality of food is good.
French,Paul,yummy pastries sandwiches and everything else,1,50,22-Jan-17,"for orchard road this place falls somewhere between the cheap eat/moderately priced and is high on quality. pastries a must and its one of the few places you can buy proper bread in Singapore, lacks in ambience as well, its in a shopping mall."
French,Paul,Great Price for 3-course + drink,1,40,19-Nov-16,"Visited the outlet at Marina Bay Link Mall. The set dinner is really very worth it as it comes with a salad or soup of the day , a main (salmon or chicken), a dessert of the day and a drink (iced peach or raspberry tea) for just $15.80++. The portion is generous for the price too. However, it's only available from Mondays to Fridays from 11+am onwards. Public holidays excluded..."
French,Paul,Very good food. Not just pastries.,1,40,18-Oct-16,"Paul @ Tanglin Mall looks like a normal bakery with a small seating area for those who wants a quick bite. I never knew they have a full selection from breakfast to dinner until my sister introduced us to the place. With a 50% discount from Eatigo, our party of 6 shared 2 salads, 6 mains, 3 desserts and 2 pots of tea for about S$144 only! The food was fresh, nicely done and well plated, desserts wonderful. We had the mushroom and seafood salads, the beef, cod and lamb as mains. For desserts, the bitter chocolate cake in a mound with gold leaf topping (forgot it's actual name), coconut flan and lemon meringue tart did not disappoint. My only small gripe was that the wait staff though competent, was a tad quick to shush us out of the cafe around 8.45pm, granted the closing time is supposedly 8.30pm. Go early if you want a leisurely dinner. The usual pricing is a bit high for the lack of ambience and space but becomes a good deal with the promotional pricing. I would go back again if the promotion continues. I do think people will go back if they reduce their normal pricing slightly to compensate for the lack of ambience and very cramped seating. "
French,Paul,Will be back again!,1,50,18-Aug-16,"Recently I was at Paul bakery located at paragon shopping mall. The food was beyond expected, good portioning and was presentable. All the staff had their smiles on definitely very welcoming! Kudos to the team! Will be back again soon!"
French,Paul,Cosy Ambience Diner,1,40,16-Aug-16,"2nd time back here at MBLM. Dinner is much more tranquil as compared to the lunch. Food didn't disappoint again, service staffs are friendly but a little more attentive would be lovely. However, recommends the dishes well. Had the Confit de canard and a dinner set (Mushroom soup, Chicken & Creme Brûlée & Raspberry Ice Tea). Portioning's decent yet satisfyingly filling. "
French,Paul,Excellent food and Good service.,1,50,15-Aug-16,I was at Paul(paragon) last week. The food was amazing really worth the price. Service was great! Good coffee and pastries. A good place to chill. Definitely will back again!
French,Paul,Convenient location,1,40,10-Aug-16,"Paul at takashimaya orchard. Right in the center of shopping area overlooking orchard road. Standard french cafe with coffee, teas and cakes. As expected, price is on higher end."
French,Paul,Delightful find on the spur of the moment,1,50,25-Jul-16,"My husband and I were in Singapore for the first time a few weeks ago. We'd been on the hop on hop off Duck tours, and we had done a lot of hopping on and off! We were famished by about 1:30pm, and had no idea where to get a good meal. We were shopping and happened by the Paul Restaurant. First impression was it was very clean and neat. Check! The waitress was knowledgeable. Check! The food was served quickly. Check! And it was delish.....hubby had soup and a sandwich, which I tasted and both were excellent. I had a nice mixed greens salad and cream of mushroom soup. Both also delicious. Oh, and the iced tea was as good as what you get at McAlisters in the US. And that is GOOD tea. All in all, I have to give them 5 stars. There was nothing we didn't like, and if we can remember where we were when we found Pau, we'll be back to eat there again in the future. Great job, Restaurant Paul. Oh, and we also took an eclair to go. Boy was that good. Its a little pricey, but nowadays you get what you pay for, and we don't mind paying for tasty food."
French,Paul,Great dessert place ,1,40,25-Jul-16,"The eclairs never fail to deliver but we decided to try something different. Check out the waffles, chicly decorated and tasted great too. Always a great dessert place!"
French,Paul,It's alright for a start.,1,40,21-Jul-16,"Visited with my Dad for for lunch. They had a Bastille Day promotion on; it was a four-course menu which we absolutely loved. Escargots on toast, roasted cod, asparagus soup, I wish it were on every day. Food is Halal as far as I know it, just that they don't have certification (yet, I heard) as they serve alcohol. To get a four-course meal for the price it was at was a nice deal. Main course portion was too small for me though. Guess it's a norm, but because it's delicious, you'll still find yourself too stuffed for dessert.  Some of the staff could do better in terms of service though, it doesn't hurt to smile, guys!Overall, a wonderful experience and I hope to visit again soon."
French,Paul,Loved it! ,1,40,11-Jul-16,Loved their food. Went there 4 times in a span of 7 days. Had lunch the first time. Chicken ratatouille was super juicy. The breakfasts were excellent. My complete omelette with the smoked salmon was delicious. Fresh orange juice was refreshing. Mom in law and wife had the seared Mediterranean fish which was excellent too. Will try their fancy dessert items next time.
French,Paul,Good for a snack or meal,1,40,7-Jul-16,"A great place for taking a break from power-shopping. The coffee is very good, as is the comprehensive range of French cuisine. I thoroughly recommend it."
French,Paul,Lunch ,1,50,6-Jul-16,"Paul is never a disappointment no matter which country you're in.We've always found their service and food to be exceptional. Always fresh and great in taste. If you haven't tried Paul, you're missing out. "
French,Paul,paul paragon branch,1,40,26-Jun-16,"ive visited the paragon branch. you will never go wrong with their pastries, burgers, salads . its heavenly. its slightly expensive but the food is superb. its not even crowded. when you wanna have a quiet and not crowded place, this is the cafe to visit. "
French,Paul,Nice place,1,40,18-Jun-16,"If you are in a need of some good pastries and tea, then Paul is the place to go to.I am sorry to say but you can't compare to the Paul restaurants in Europe but you are definitely on the right track.The service needs improvements and also the cups and glassware.Overall the pastries are good and the tea is good.Hope you will change to a better coffee in the near future."
French,Paul,Great pastries... Service indifferent,1,40,5-Jun-16,"A great place to stop for a break, tea and pastries lovely service was average. Tarts normande was light and delicate. I'd definitely go back for the food"
French,Paul,One of my favourite places,1,50,19-May-16,"London, Dubai or Singapore this place never goes wrong. I love everything here - the food, the coffee, the hot chocolate, the desserts, it is all amazing."
French,Paul,Great customer service and good coffee,1,40,11-Mar-16,Coffee at perfect temperature and great taste - not too strong. Food was delicious. Really nice customer service.
French,Paul,It's Paul after all.,1,40,9-Feb-16,"Friendly and helpful staff, with a relaxing atmosphere, good for chitchats.We were looking for dessert and the colourful tarts and pies attracted us. There, we were treated to a colourful array of yummy treats, so many that we took a long time to decide what to have. My friend went for the Mandarin orange tart, which is really good - sweet succulent canned oranges on a crunchy tart base, not too sweet and not too tart. With it she had the rosemary lime tea, which I tried and was not very impressed. It is too herby for a coffee lover like me.I had the almond and apple tart (flan Normandy), which was a bit sweet for my preference, but still tasted good. It had roasted almond flakes on top which I loved.. The coffee I had is Cafe Glace, which is fancy terms for an espresso shot with a nice vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate. The coffee is a bit sour in the beginning, so so let the ice cream melt and do its magic, which became very good."
French,Paul,A short break,1,40,14-Jan-16,"We ate there a few times for lunch, you could have a meal or as we did more a light lunch which suited us."
French,Paul,Excellent food,1,50,30-Nov-15,"The food is very nice, the pastry as much as the hot dishes, try the tourte provençale. A shame about the poor service that drag down the experience."
French,Paul,Perfect Lunch-time break in Orchard,1,40,25-Nov-15,"Easy to reach and to meet at, Paul has a perfectly simple menu that caters to a quick and comfortable lunch in a Bistro-like atmosphere inside a mall."
French,Paul,Perfect for a quick and simple lunch!,1,40,16-Nov-15,"At a break time of meeting, I went to Paul and bought a duck sandwich for lunch. I haven't tried this when I was in France and I was surprised for its good taste! A little bit sweat which differs with other tastes and the duck is very fresh."
French,Paul,Nice brunch with very good breakfast options and good French sandwiches,1,40,10-Nov-15,Very good sandwiches and breakfast options including eggs and coffee. Sandwiches and salads are fresh and service was very good. Found it to be a bit pricey though for the quality of food.
French,Paul,a great French dining,1,40,5-Nov-15,"I usually prefer to patronize Paul before noon for a hearty brunch, a time when the crowd is thinner and the queue more acceptable. I prefer a seat within, admiring the interior decor reminiscent of European styles but sometimes I can only get a seat outside of the cafe, staring at patrons of the mall and get stared back in return.Sometimes I get myself a choice from the usual caffeinated suspects, and if I am not up for a cup of tea or coffee, then I would choose from their other beverage selections. I loved their Chocolat Frappé à la Menthe from its Ice Blend section for its menthol sensation mixed well into the rich chocolaty taste, and I feel the urge sometimes to get to this restaurant for a cup of refreshing Lemongrass Iced Tea, its acquired taste a tang against my taste buds.Their menu is quite varied and, of course, very French. So far my favorite remains Roulade de Poulet, a dish of stuffed chicken with pumpkin puree."
French,Paul,Afternoon delight,1,40,2-Nov-15,PAULs do seem to be popping up everywhere. Lovely to relax and have tea and cake in between shopping
French,Paul,Good resturant,1,50,19-Oct-15,"The service they offer in this restaurant was good, even we need to queue for few minutes but they try to make it fast. the food was served quite fast, although they missed my request to have separated sugar for my coffee. overall, I satisfied with this restaurant..."
French,Paul,Classic European afternoon tea ,1,40,19-Oct-15,"With a wide range of places to eat and drink in the Orchard shopping district, here is an ideal (relatively less crowded) place to bring mom and sister for a nice chat. Macarons were not remarkable but coffee and ambience made up for it."
French,Paul,Delightful French style cafe (Tanglin Mall branch),1,40,9-Sep-15,"I spotted this quaint little cafe in the mall next to the hotel I was staying in and decided to try it out for breakfast, in lieu of the uninspiring breakfast buffet I had in the hotel that day.Arrived at about 10 a.m. and the place was almost empty, guess I arrived after the rush hour and had most of the place to myself, except for 2 other tables. Had some really nice and thin French style pancakes, an almond croissant and a hot mocha, all very nice and better than most comparable places in Hong Kong and was pleasantly pleased by the experience."
French,Paul,A Real Patisserie in Orchard Road,1,40,24-Aug-15,"There are quite a few 'ordinary' places for afternoon tea in Orchard Road but Paul's looked better than most so we tried it, and were not disappointed. There a pleasant, upholstered armchairs, dark, polished wooden tables and, being a couple of floors up, there was a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere away from the bustle of the shopping centre. The patisseries and cakes taste as good as they look and are typical of some of those you might find in Paris or in a good German konditorei. The coffee is good, without being exceptional, but enjoyable nonetheless. Service was good, though not always as attentive as in other cafes. We will go back next time we want a pleasant break from Orchard Road."
French,Paul,A delicious French bakery/restaurant,1,40,3-Aug-15,"Tanglin Mall, which has everything from clothing to toys to groceries, was close to the hotel in which my husband and I stayed on a recent trip. While in the mall, we had a wonderful lunch at Paul’s Bakery. I had salade carpaccio with zucchini and rocket salad (arugula) with balsamic glaze. Wonderful. My husband had Tourte Provençal - a tart of eggplant, zucchini, tomato and Parmesan sandwich, which he enjoyed. The French bread was as good as it gets. For dessert we split a Palmier (elephant ear), and each had a cappuccino, topped with a beautiful design made in the foam. The service wasn’t what we might have liked, but we thoroughly enjoyed the lunch, attractive to both the taste and the eye. A delicious bakery and restaurant that we recommend."
French,Paul,Pricey food,1,40,25-Jul-15,"Food has quality and good but the service was lousy. My daughter and I were standing in the Q waiting to get a seat however the staffs walked past me seem do not bother to serve me. I have to walked inside and get someone who can find me a seat. To my surprise, there are few available seats outside the restaurant. The staffs are not friendly and helpful when I have a friend who joined me later. The waitress simply told me there is no empty chair available which is not true. There was no service standard."
French,Paul,Piece de Boeuf - a masterpiece!,1,40,14-Jul-15,"At first I was only interested to try their pastries. But then when I saw people sitting to have lunch, then I decided to try their meals.One of the most recommended menus was ""Piece De Boeuf"" - Beef sirloin served with salad and fried potatoes and shallots.The taste was superb! I never tried anything like it. The steak was very soft and felt like melted in my mouth. It's a must try ;-) The price was not cheap but it's totally worth it."
French,Paul,Great sweets,1,40,11-Jul-15,The macaron and the chocolate tart were good. Will definitely go back to try some of the other things next time!
French,Paul,Afternoon Coffee 14th June. ,1,40,14-Jun-15,"Had to wait for around 10 min for table which was ok because of the free wifi in Taka. Ordering was simple and fast and the food came quickly. The drinks took 5 min longer. I am impressed with the taste of the Nepolian not over sweet and the apricot tart was tart because if the fresh apricots. The pastry was crispy and thin. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant. Ambience ??????Menu Selection ????????Service ??????Food Quality ????????Portion Size ????????Value for Money ??????Average Rating: 3.5  "
French,Paul,French Restaurant,1,40,8-Apr-15,Visited Paul's for Lunch.Tuna Sandwich-Multigrain bread was excellent.The other dishes on the menu were mouthwatering but not being very hungry just had the above.They have varied choice for the not so hungry to the very hungry.
French,Paul,Nice place but disappointed ,1,40,3-Apr-15,"Great patisserie, we've been here many times both sit in and take away, but today we ordered a couple of simple sandwiches and soup. The soup was cold and the sandwich order incorrect - they took ages to fix it, nearly 30 mins despite our complaint. They could do with sharpening up their service to come in line with the premium prices they are charging before they will be deserving of an ""excellent"" rating."
French,Paul,Delectable but a bit high-priced,1,40,1-Apr-15,"Food is delicious especially their dessert but the price is a bit on the high side. Good ambience, service is average as the waitress need us to remind her of our order."
French,Paul,A Taste of France,1,40,10-Feb-15,"We went to this place last night for our monthsary dinner. Surprisingly there was no queue because most of the time it's fully packed whenever I pass by. We had a table reservation and we got a table outside the resto. These are the dishes that we tried:Confit de Canard - this is a classic dish of the Perigord region of France. It's a slow roast herb marinated duck leg with roasted vegetables and cranberry sauce. The meat was so tender and complimented well with the cranberry sauce. This is a must-try at Paul.Saute' de poulet aux champignons - these are roasted chicken chunks in mushroom sauce with Paul's country bread. I like the mushroom sauce, it's so creamy. They give a generous serving of the bread too.Pistachio Macarons Frappe - this made from macarons blended with vanilla cream and milk. I actually tried this because I was curious on how it would turn out. It was good and you can feel the macarons as you take a sip. It's not bad but I just realized that macarons should just be eaten as itself and not as a drink. Tartelette Citron Meringueé - this is a lemon cream tartlet with soft meringue. I absolutely loved this! Usually I judge basing on how it looks like on the menu and It was my partner who actually ordered it. But when I tried it, it was divine. I ended up eating most of the portions. HahaPure Jee - its a chocolate mousse blob which is considered the darkest chocolate pastry at Pauls'. I'm not an avid fan of chocolates but it's still good. The chocolate mousse inside the blob is rich, thick and at time crunchy. I would say that I would definitely come back to eat here as there are still a lot of nice listings in their menu like the crepes, éclairs and tarts."
French,Paul,Good coffee and great desserts,1,40,5-Feb-15,"Nice, quaint, European style cafe. I've tried Paul's Boulanger Patisserie in Bangkok and now Singapore. Good coffee and great, freshly baked bread and Pastries."
French,Paul,A piece of Paris in Tanglin,1,40,27-Dec-14,Nice breakfast menu. The sides of salmon was well worth the price. Coffee was excellent. And of course pastries that are so delicious.
French,Paul,Great food and lovely cakes and tarts,1,40,21-Dec-14,"I first experienced Paul in Paris many years ago and I was delighted when they opened in Singapore. I have been here many times, but in my most recent experience I felt that they had expanded the menu and improved the food. I had the Croque Monsieur for breakfast and I think it is one of the best Croque Monsieurs I have had in a long time. Their breads and cakes and tarts are always delicious. And their dinner menu seems to have a lot more choice than before. Good place for comfort food."
French,Paul,When all you need is some good scrambled eggs . . .,1,50,29-Oct-14,"As the title said, sometimes you just need to have some scrambled eggs on toast, Paul offers this every time, good service and excellent quality food. A simple choice of venue that always delivers."
French,Paul,Very crowded restaurant,1,40,17-Oct-14,Served good pan cake however very crowded on weekend many peoples waiting for table staffs rushing to clear off the plate on the table while we are not done yet.
French,Paul,French Afternoon Delight...A Quaint French Bakery in the heart of Singapore,1,50,30-Sep-14,"Was wondering where to have a quiet and interesting afternoon tea when we stumbled upon this French bakery. Fresh French breads, tarts, baquettes, macaroons & cakes...for a weekday afternoon, it's almost full house. Everyone seem to have something interesting on their table. Menu looks interesting with different salad, appetizers, sandwiches with your choice of bread, croissants. It was hard to choose as everything looked interesting. We settled for an afternoon tea set that comprises of a cappuccino/latte, 2 mini macaroons (lemon & caramel), a mini creme brûlée & a chocolate cake. This set costs a decent $12. I wanted a scrumptious looking lemon raspberry sponge cake (Moelleux citron framboise-$7.40), however it was sold out. French jazz was played in the background with crystal chandelier on the ceiling..we had a corner table that overlooks the busy Orchard road..Overall, it was a great time spent with a scrumptious afternoon tea."
French,Paul,Almost perfect,1,40,29-Aug-14,Delicious food and good tasting coffee. We had sandwiches and a croque Monsieur. Everything was very well prepared and tasted delicious. The sandwiches were baguettes and came -as the croque Monsieur - together with a side salad. Overall good value for money and authentic French taste!Could not give 5 stars since no wifi available there (strange for a café in the midst of Takashimaya-Mall)
French,Paul,Best pastries in Singapore,1,40,26-Aug-14,Went there for breakfast. They simply have the best pastries in town. The breakfast is actually a good deal by Singapore standards.Zero atmosphere specially if you're sitting outside. It is in a huge shopping centre where the shops open at 10:00. Paul opens at 09:30.
French,Paul,Paul - worth a second shot,1,40,30-Jul-14,"It was my second visit here, this time for lunch with a couple of lady friends.I started with a Tartine Saumon (SGD$19.90) - smoked salmon, avocado, leek , mixed herbs and cheese. The smoked salmon was succulent and not too salty, and I love the combination of this cold, slimy delicacy wrapped around buttery avocado, nestling atop crispy slices of toast. It was a healthy but satisfactory concoction of all my favorite things, done in flavors that danced across the tongue.*Chantal had the Omelette Complete (SGD$14.90) - omelette with slices of grilled turkey ham, mushrooms and cheese served with salad, Provencal tomatoes and potatoes. It was a flavorful piece of culinary art, with the eggs beaten well and taste was well-accorded with a nice balance of the fillings within the protein-rich omelette.I had the Raspberry Tart (SGD$7.90) - Tartlette Framboises - classic fruit tartlet made with a crispy, buttery pastry crust, filled with creme patissiere and topped with raspberries. Contrary to its glossy, syrupy-looking photos, the real tart came with raspberries powdered with sugar / icing instead, giving the sour fruits a sweet guise. The pastry crust was delicious though, and the creme fillings was silky smooth with a light, lovely flavor.*Chantal had the Millefeuille Fraises - crispy golden puff pastry, strawberry creme-filled Napoleon cake topped with light apricot glaze. The combination of textures - crispiness, soft creamy sweetness and juicy bits of real strawberries embedded within this pretty pastry was a sinful necessity in itself - lovely!For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/lunch-at-pauls-bakery-restaurant-cafe.html"
French,Paul,dessert heaven,1,40,24-Jul-14,"*THIS IS FOR THE WESTGATE OUTLETlocation - westgate mall @ Jurongpremise - quiet and nice. very good for dates, coffee get together n just plain relaxing on your ownstaff - good and polite greeting and prompt servicefood - we didnt try the mains as they looked quite basic to us but the desserts? heavenly. they all were good and made very well!!verdict - good place to go for desserts and here @ WESTGATE, there was no crowd so it was easy to get the seats on a weekday evening (645pm)"
French,Paul,Good food. Average service. ,1,40,12-Jul-14,"But good ambience. Nice location for shoppers or business people. During peak hours be prepared to queue. Queue will move slowly as food does not come out of Kitchen quick enough and service is slow. Once they even forgot our order. But when the food did arrive. It was like wow. Great cod. My boss eats elegant foods and he enjoyed it. I've been here about 5times in 2 yrs and enjoyed the food every time. I also learned that in restaurant service in general is average and I do not expect too much. This way you can still enjoy your visit, the food and just nudge your server to do a good job. I will visit Paul's at Ngee Ann City soon. "
French,Paul,OK Price for Orchard - Nice Food - Always Busy,1,40,10-Jul-14,"Place is always busy however they always manage to find a spot for you.I attended with three work colleagues for a quick lunch and was light and easy, Prices are what you would expected for Orchard around Takashimaiya so if you don't want to pay S$ 20+ for lunch then head back to ION Food Court."
French,Paul,Tanglin mall restaurant.,1,40,7-Jul-14,"Excellent service. Great food. An authentic atmosphere and menu. Particularly impressed with real bread after days of steamed ""toast"". Will look out for their other sites"
French,Paul,Good atmosphere and food. ,1,50,29-Jun-14,"Paul in Ngee Ann City is a comfortable space to put up your feet, sit back and relax. I had the fish meal which was delicious and the raspberry and creme éclair for dessert. Yum. Main was $27.00 so two courses around $50. My only feedback was that they were so busy that service was lacking and we had to constantly call staff over. The staff were friendly though. "
French,Paul,"Yummy Bread, but service a bit slow",1,40,29-May-14,"I have been to Paul (Takashimaya Shopping Centre)twice in the last 3 months, and I have not been dissappointed by the food, nor the yummy bread which I always love. It is a little expensive but worth getting away from the norm in Singapore. Try the Mango salad, before you finish the free side serving of bread. Avoid peak hour like over lunch time unless you want to stand in a line. A little ahead of lunch time say 1145 is better. only negative is the service which can be a little slow, like we had to ask for water, the bill, food took awhile to be served but the wait is worth it. oh and yes take some bread home from the baker!"
French,Paul,"Grand European cafe style, great for a light lunch",1,40,27-Mar-14,"This is a nice grand cafe style restaurant which is quite different to the Paul style in Europe. The location is impeccable and the restaurant nicely decorated, light and airy. There were many staff and service was prompt if a little curt. The food was as expected, simple, fresh and nicely served. As always the bread and pastries are a particular strength of Paul and this Singapore incarnation is no exception. Great for a simple lunch in above average surroundings. Quite pricy but not much above the norm for this quarter of Singapore's shopping district."
French,Paul,Great start of the day,1,50,31-Dec-13,"Just went to the Tanglin mall outlet for breakfast and it was excellent. Great service, great food, good coffee, good atmosphere good prices. Would come again."
French,Paul,French bakery,1,40,27-Dec-13,"Paul, is a French bakery and restaurant chain that was first set up in Croix in 1889. They now have many branches all over the world. I have been to some in the Middle East. They now have 5 branches in Singapore.Some of their food is quite nice, their desserts nice but look better and their bread very nice. If you're in the mood for a nice evening with a bottle of wine and some runny or smell delicious French cheese, get the bread from Paul. Their bread is ideal for eating with soft French cheese."
French,Paul,Nice place to chill,1,50,17-Dec-13,Chose this cafe for breakfast meeting and we love the breakfast selwction. The menu has quite a wide choice and price is reasonable. Service staff is attentive and great too. Will definitely be back
French,Paul,Good place for lesisurely for tea and pastries,1,50,16-Dec-13,We used to go for tea at Kinokuniya Coffee Club. This is an excellent find very near the bookstore with good ambience. Get a window seating. Enjoyed the pastries and macarons
French,Paul,Not bad at all....,1,40,30-Nov-13,"Can get crowded at times. Comfortable seatings though. Staffs can be a bit slow and inattentive sometimes, maybe due to so many patrons. The food, excellent. Really enjoyed our lunch there."
French,Paul,An excellent find,1,50,18-Nov-13,"Good food, nice décor, above average service by Singapore standards.
Large portion sizes, (the salmon salad contained a large portion of salmon)
The lemon meringue pie was amazing, possibly the best I’ve ever had.
I nice venue for afternoon tea"
French,Paul,Best raspberry tarts in my life,1,40,3-Oct-13,"Coffee, tea, hot chocolate so so. Really love their raspberry tarts, sweet and a bit sour fruit, big raspberry too. Think tiong bahru bakery has something similar but raspberry smaller andmore expensive. Paul is a nice place to go for afternoon teas. I think the croissant ($1.80 exclude gst and taxes) is nice when they heat up for dine in. It's certainly worth when they served you cheese butter and yummy jams with the croissant. But the better one ($2.50) is at the bakery shop right inside taka basement besides cold storage. The one just at the entrance of basement is $1.30 when you heat it up just like any nice croissant. Paul's sesame bread they gave free for group dine in is only $2.50. Where to get such superb quality at this price at bread talk. Paul only accept walk in. Happy queueing."
French,Paul,Fantastic food!,1,50,9-Aug-13,I enjoy every bite and every sip of every menu I ordered. Great food and coffee. I will definitely be a regular customer.
French,Paul,Nice lunch at Paul,1,40,3-Jul-13,"Not sure why I found so many bad reviews here. Because for me personally, the food are quite good. Yes, the coffees are weak but the bread selections from their bakery are really nice. A bit pricey for a light meal, expect to spend around S$30-35 for a meal and drink. Avoid long queues by coming early for lunch or dinner."
French,Paul,Worth a visit if you are looking for lunch in the Orchard Road area,1,50,28-May-13,"Really good food, good service and very friendly staff who really looked after us. Tables a bit close together but not enough to spoil your meal."
French,Paul,Excellent Meal,1,40,30-Mar-13,"Had a really good breakfast at Paul's. Salmon, with turkey ham and eggs were were really great. It can be considered pretty pricey as they charge $8.80 for freshly squeezed orange juice, but the ambience is pretty good. Its a must try for me. :)"
French,Paul,PAUL - French Bakery Restaurant (Le Restaurant Du Boulanger),1,50,25-Feb-13,The service was fantastic as was the food. Holy wow on the food here. If you can't make a trip to Paris at least you can cure a craving at Paul in Singapore.
French,Paul,Yummy French Pastries,1,40,4-Jan-13,"If you are craving for French pastries plus a coffee, then Paul is your place. It is not cheap but the quality is very good and the service is fine. We didn't have to wait at all."
French,Paul,Eat here if you shop at Takishamaya,1,50,1-Dec-12,"This cafe has a nice view from the windows overlooking Orchard Road and has very comfortable furniture and pleasant decore. It is always busy and we've had to line up on occasions but it is worth it.The food is French cafe influenced with crepes. beautiful crisp bread and pastries, but also has beautiful salads with lovely fresh and healthy ingredients.You can get freshly squeezed juices or iced tea to go with your delicious salad or just go for the decadent tarts and desserts with a well made coffee. There is an excellent book shop next door if you're after something to read on your plane trip, as well as a money changer. The cafe is on the 3rd or 4th floor from memory and you can enter from the middle tower on Orchard Road."
French,Paul,Tom O,1,50,19-Nov-12,"While walking through the Takayeshama shopping center we thought we would look for a restaurant to eat lunch. Remembering what Anthony Bordaine said on his travel food show that usually where there is a long line, the food will probably be good we started looking for the long lines. At the same time, I was looking for a money exchange place and on the 2nd floor, I found the money exhangeer and a long line waiting to be seated at the restaurant Paul Bakery. I think I was also attracted to the great bakery smell wafting through the walkways. After being seated, we ordered and split a bowl of broccoli soup and two outstanding sandwiches. The soup was exquisite and the sandwiches were wonderful. We sat in the outside walkway and were able to wach people as we ate. Of course after eating lunch, we had to take a box of two bite sized macaroons with us for later endulgence. This is a French boulangerie/patisserie at it's best and it was packed with customers."
French,Paul,Pastries still the specialties ,1,40,17-Nov-12,"Went to Paul for a breakfast at around 10.30am Sat, already crowded with a lot foreigners and tourists, constantly having Short que. I ordered their breakfast set with sunny side up eggs and ham, and cafe mocha. My wife ordered the Grand Cafe with bread, The food were good, but not spectacular. The mocha was rich but too much chocolate, but this is their way. Later we order a peach cinnamon tart, which is excellent, but we were too full to order more pastries. So I would suggest stick with their pastries. The "
French,Paul,Excellent experience,1,40,22-Aug-12,"Paul is on the 3rd floor of Ngee Ann building ( better known as the Takashimaya building) smack bang in the middle of Singapore's main shopping artery, Orchard Road. I just dropped in for a coffee and croissant and while the food was quite good, what really impressed me was the superb service. The lady who served me,Jennifer, was courteous to a fault, prompt and extremely efficient, qualities which are quite rare in the service industry in Singapore. She made my day, what more can I say!"
French,Paul,Excellent breakfast,1,40,19-Aug-12,"I moved from France to the UK and then to Singapore. Singapore has a lot of western food out there to not forget your home country. Paul Bakery (which used to also be in Edinburgh, Scotland) is to me a very good place, where you can enjoy some really good pastries. I go almost every weekend for breakfast, where I order usually a Grand creme with a basket (croissant, pain au chocolate, half a baguette tradition and a briochette). My wife prefers savory food such as eggs, or salads. The pain au raisin (escargots) are fantastic. My daughter loves the macaroons. Fresh juice are also greatIt's a great bakery, where I am always looking forward to go.Having said that, I think there are some limitations, such as the bread choices. Bread is an old type so-called tradition which is harder to eat, because tougher and heavier. Then there is no choice between butter ie salted/unsalted. The fruit juices are sometimes too much loaded with water/ice. The portion are not consistent between the tables. The prices are rather high, but in line with western prices for a value for money ratio. More specifically to the Ngee Ann City's Paul, one of the major drawback is the queue to get in, the turnaround of the tables (some tables remains available but are not given) and the service can lack of efficiency.Anyway, I would recommend this place."
French,Paul,Nice European Style Cafe and bakery,1,40,8-Aug-12,"This is a really nice café, right on Orchard Road, next to Takashimaya departament store. They serve light meals with the most exquisite cakes. Very busy on a Sunday lunch time, service a bit slow. Not cheap"
French,Paul,Breakfast,1,40,10-Jul-12,"Went there for breakfast, breads were not great but good pastries and excellent services"
French,Paul,Up to Expectation,1,40,21-May-12,"I have always been a fan of Paul in Paris. The one in Singapore has lived up to my expectation although the food seems priced compared to those in Paris. While the Paul in Paris is a common bakery, the Singapore one looks too posh for the common people. The food is just as good. Overall, I am contented that Paul finds its way to this Southeast Asian ""little red dot""."
French,Paul,Best bread and pastries,1,40,29-Apr-12,I was looking forward for the opening and Paul meets my expectation. Bread and pastries are the best in town. But I found the restaurant too pricy to seat and take away is a better deal.
French,Paul,"PAUL, Maison De Qualité 1889 [Singapore]",1,40,27-Apr-12,"For full story, please go to www.epinosh.comMy story with PAUL café has began. It was a delayed encounter with the renowned boulangerie from the Northern France. Since its inception in 1889, it has franchised more than 400 bakery café world-widely and Singapore seems to be the latest venture in Asia.Speaking of the crowds at PAUL, I was terrified. I have heard of people making a beeline at the café entrance and that the restaurant waiting service has been poor, kitchen almost went into retardation, food quality didn't match up and the negative response goes on. That was probably 3 months ago when it first welcome its diners in Singapore. I am not totally surprised by the teething issues they faced,  given the outlet is the first in Singapore. For dinner, I ordered Croque Saumon Poireaux. The roast salmon and leeks married well! Embedded between those cheesy toasted bread, they are so moist and delicious! The whole dish was not overly bready.Another came along; Crepe Complete. It is turkey & cheese in a pancake topped with a fried egg. Interestingly, the oozing cheese fills up your oral cavity while its aroma chalked up your nasal concha!I decided on Hot Vanilla Milk to interact with my food. I have to admit my ignorance.. I have thought that ""milk is an unsweetened drink"" and it turned out to be sugared? Levelling up my knowledge, I owed it to PAUL. The vanilla milk was a real classic; nicely infused and not artificial.    "
French,Poulet,Most tender,1,50,21-Nov-16,"This place primarily serves roast chicken. However, unlike most of the dry bland roast chicken served in most places this restaurant has the most tender chicken I've ever eaten. On top of being perfectly cooked the chicken was served with two of the most flavorful sauces I've ever eaten. Side dishes were good but the chicken was perfect and merits a return trip! "
French,Poulet,Perfect food and very good people,1,50,20-Oct-16,"I eat several times here as i stay long in jurong east, it is hard to find a place if you dont book in the weekend so only by this you can see that it is a good place, i advice the mushroom soup, paris salad and lamb hank"
French,Poulet,Affordable French Cuisine,1,40,26-Mar-16,"I had the Poulet Roti with Mushroom Chardonnay Sauce, the Tiramisu in a bottle, and the Creme Brûlée. The price was not too pricey yet I could smell and taste the truffle mashed potato that I had along with the entree."
French,Poulet,good food,1,40,29-Feb-16,we were really just walking around the place looking for somewhere to eat and i'm so glad we came across this restaurant. their escargot was so good and the roast chicken with chardonnay sauce was excellent! everything else was good too.
French,Poulet,Great dining experience,1,50,2-Oct-15,We stumbled across this little restaurant and Oh my gosh I'm so glad we did. What an amazing meal!! The food was cooked to perfection. We had the chicken and lamb shanks... the meat just fell of the bone and the chicken was so tender. We enjoyed it that much we went back the next night and it was just the same. Absolutely exquisite!! A great meal for a great price. This place is an absolute must on your dining experience in Chinatown! Well done Poulet and compliments again to the Chef! 
French,Poulet,Worked For Us,1,40,21-Sep-15,"Our hotel was across the road from the Chinapoint Mall so it was the obvious place to look for a meal. We stopped over for just one night, and thoroughly sick of the heavy meals in the UK, we were looking for somewhere to have a decent light salad for lunch before heading to the airport. It is difficult to find salad in Singapore but Poulet had three different choices. We chose smoked duck, which was melt in the mouth stuff; the various components of the salad that went with it were lovely and fresh, with a very nice raspberry oil drizzled over it. It was a quiet day with only one other table being occupied, and being lunch time I had an iced tea and my husband only had water, which was offered as soon as we were seated. The service was friendly (a staff member offered to take a photo of the two of us at the table) and immediate - we couldn't fault it, and the price was what we expected - quite acceptable."
French,Poulet,Quiet Ambience amidst a crowded mall ,1,50,16-Jan-15,"Signature full chicken with mushroom cream sauce was simply delicious. Goes perfectly with their chestnut rice. Tiramisu dessert was a nice end to our lunch.
Would definitely return again."
French,Poulet,Reasonable price. Good quality food. ,1,40,13-Dec-14,"Recommend their signature roast chicken and the mash potato. Definitely suitable for families of all ages. mash potato could be serve to the kids, yummy and average portion to share. Another to try is their escargot. I liked the way how it is served and most importantly the salsa sauce. Flavoursome! Will definitely go back again. "
French,Poulet,Tasty French cuisines with a decent setting,1,40,1-Oct-14,The signature roast chicken with cream based sauce was amazing. The staff were pretty friendly and the food came in within a reasonable time. All in all it was a very pleasing experience and we would go there again for a nice and pleasant meal which doesn't cost a fortune.
French,Poulet,Best Poultry Meal,1,50,13-Aug-14,"Together with my wife and daughter we had great, delicious and affordable lunch @ Poulet. Must try their mashed potato and mushroom soup that taste just heavenly. Must try!Poulet Diane Half $17.90Salad De Canard Fume (Smoked Duck) $12.90Mashed Potato $4.90Mushroom Soup $5.9010% Service Charge $4.147% GST $3.20Total for 3 pax only $48.96 (If you have a bigger appetite please order a full bird) Enjoy!"
French,Poulet,Amazing food,1,50,6-Aug-14,This place is incredible! the food and deserts are delicious... If you go to Singapore you have to try the roasted chicken with mushroom and the tiramisu! Love it!
French,Poulet,"For the price, very good.",1,40,26-Jul-14,"Both chicken dishes are great. The pork belly is great. The tiramisu is fantastic. Each main course range from 15 - 20 dollars, and for that price the food tastes pretty good. The roast chicken is supremely tender with a stunning sauce to go with it. Highly recommended for casual diners."
French,Poulet,Tasty cuisine but no alcohol licence?!,1,40,29-Jun-14,"This place is SUPERPOPULAR amongst the locals .... It is crowded with huge queues outside... Admittedly it is tasty French cuisine, consistent quality (we have eaten at the branches in Vivocity and Chinatown Point), small portions ... My 14 yr old daughter loves it. My biggest gripe as an adult is that it has no alcohol licence. Seriously, French food and no wine? Come on ..."
French,Poulet,Worth the try!,1,40,28-Jun-14,It was my 1st french food experience Finally had the courage to give it a try at the Westgate outletStaffs was friendly and attentiveWaited about 20mins on a friday eveningThey took our order while waiting for our seat to be readyWe ordered1) Oxtail2) LambShank3) Their signature roast chicken4) Saute Mushroom5) Peach Clafoutis6) Apple TartThumbs up for all the dishes except I find the Lamb Shank abit tough but the Oxtail was my favoritePay slightly more than $80 for the above 6 itemsWill definitely go back again !
French,Poulet,French Roasted Chicken - worth the try!,1,40,17-Jun-14,"Noticed this restaurant in several places, finally took the effort to try it at Westgate. Since roast chicken was their signature dish, I ordered a half portion for myself. You can choose Chardonnay sauce (which I had) or cranberry. Staff was attentive even though it was on a friday evening. Waiting time was reasonable. Chicken was cooked yet moist. The sauce had a nice balanced flavour to it, although I think some may think it a bit salty to taste.Tried the mash potato as a side, very creamy and enjoyable. Worth the try if you love chicken or just want to have french food at reasonable price."
French,Poulet,Poultry at Poulet is magnifique,1,40,6-May-14,"Was my first time to Poulet (T3 outlet) at the invite of my friends. He was raving about the dishes, especially their poultry dish with mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Other than the poultry dish, we also had the french onion soup, the oxtail stew, some fries for appetizer and another friend of my ordered the brisket. The review: true to the recommendation, the poultry was very tender and moist. Apparently it was soaked in brine for a whole day before it was slow roasted. However, it did not go well with the mushroom Chardonnay sauce. Simply put, it was more like Carbonara sauce from a bottle off the supermarket shelves . There is no taste of mushroom or Chardonnay, just heavy cream. The french onion was average. Another dish worth mentioning was the oxtail. My wife had a few atttempts at making oxtail stew at home and the lesson learnt to a good stew is slow cook or pressure-cooking. Poulet did just that and the result is a tender, beefy oxtail stew. Though i did not taste the red wine in the red wine sauce, the oxtail itself was good enough. As for the brisket, forget about it as the meat was dry. Overall, i would recommend Poulet to my friends, though i would ask them to skip the ""Mushroom"" ""Chardonnay"" sauce and go for the poultry itself."
French,Poulet,fabulous!,1,50,12-Apr-14,"A french style restaurant, very clean and fast service. the food are all good with affordable price. this is recommended restaurant."
French,Poulet,French style food,1,40,14-Feb-14,"The food here is what I would call ' version"" of French food and not bad at all, whilst not being fancy at all. French style roast chicken is the signature dish here.The menu is neither extensive nor sophisticated but there is plenty to choose from and I was pleased with the choice.Portions are small-ish but I prefer it that way -- and for the price I paid this was a well cooked, tasty meal at a good price, in a pleasant little restaurant."
French,Poulet,"Good food, good value",1,40,28-Dec-13,"After watching a movie at GV, we came across Poulet so we decided to try it out. It's reasonably priced (about $15 per dish), for nice ambiance and good food. I ordered the mushroom soup and Salad de Paris and my husband ordered the oxtail dish and a side of baguette. The soup was very creamy but delicious and the salad was good but only consisted of tiny amount of avocado and slightly too much dressing (a little too sweet), but it was fresh and good. My husband's oxtail was incredibly soft and flavorful, but the slices of baguette (for $5) could have used a bit more butter and toasting (only the top one came out a little browned). Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will be back to try a few of the other items on the menu that looked good!"
French,Poulet,Love the roast chicken!,1,40,26-Dec-13,"It's been a while since I ate at this place.... So perhaps my review's abit outdated?I went to the outlet at Bugis + in 2012 and then the one in Great World City early this year 2013...I really love the roast chicken.... Both times, the roast chicken was done just right... very tender and juicy yet the skin is crispy... I also had the escargots and loved them...We tried the tiramisu the 2nd time we went and was delighted with it.... Recently, it seems that everywhere I go, I can see Poulet... At the rate it's popping up everywhere, I hope the quality of the food will not drop... For the not so cheap pricing, the food better be good to justify it....I will review here again when I visit it the next time round..."
French,Poulet,Nice dining environment and service,1,40,24-Oct-13,"Did not know that there is an outlet in Jurong Point, just was looking around in the mall for dinner venue, and came across this restaurant. I did not know about this restaurant much until recently my friend went to dine in their Bugis outlet, and was praising the food was nice. Therefore, my husband and I went into this restaurant to try as we trusted this friend's taste very much. First the environment, we were led into the restaurant by a waitress, there are outdoor seating and indoor seating and we chose indoor ones. The place is bright and tidy, with some photos of food on the white walls and some trees indoor. Nice and neat. Staffs were very courteous too. Food wise, I do not know what is the taste of Authentic French food, but all I know is that the food are nice, chicken are well toasted. The staff recommended me to try their popular Cranberry sauce chicken, which I think is not too bad, the mushroom soup is nice too but I do not like their French onion soup. My husband ordered the pork belly, which I had tasted and is better than my cranberry sauce chicken. Escargot is normal, nothing fantastic, but I like the dessert Tiramisu. Sweet on the top where the cream is and bitter at the bottom where the alcohol is. Price wise, is affordable, much cheaper than most French restaurants. It cost us about $75 for a plate of cranberry sauce chicken(half chicken), a plate of pork belly, a plate of escargot, one tiramisu, one onion soup and one mushroom soup, a few slices of baguette and a bottle of mineral water. But one thing many not happy with is the charge they imposed on water, they do not provide cold plain water instead they sell mineral water at 1.80 each bottle which can be shared between two persons, and they will provide warm water at 50cents each glass refillable. Well, some may think is unreasonable but I think it's a trend now as more and more restaurants are practicing this.So, if you are not so particular about getting Authentic French food and want a nice place to sit down and dine, this may be the one suitable for you. If you want to try very authentic French cuisine, this may not be one. It already called itself a casual French restaurant. As for me, I will go back again to try other dishes. Heard their mushroom and tomatoes not bad too!!!"
French,Poulet,Yummy! Value for money!,1,40,22-Oct-13,"We had their signature chicken dish and it was tasty! The price is reasonable for such delicious French cuisine. The lamb stew was delicious as well, very soft and nicely cooked. The crews are friendly and fast. Overall it was a good experience. Will definitely visit again."
French,Poulet,Awesome salad and soup,1,50,28-Sep-13,If you are on a restrictive diet then this is one of the places to go. Value for money simple meal but outstanding in taste. The soup and salad was excellent. A place to go often. Pleasant ambience and merits going often.
French,Poulet,Tasty. French Flavors in Chinatown,1,40,26-Sep-13,"After feeling like something other than Chinese food we literally stumbled upon Poulet in china Point mall. The food was tasty, reasonable size and well priced. The staff were very friendly and we returned a few days later they remembered what we had ordered earlier. They changed a dish for one of our group who had special dietary needs. If you feel like a change when surrounded by a Chinese food give it a try."
French,Poulet,simply loving it. Nice roasted chicken.,1,40,6-Sep-13,"Tried it without much expectation, just it turned out to be an ""eye-brown rising"" dish. we had the whole roasted chicken, it was so nice, the sauce wasnt too rich until you cant have a good taste of the chicken. It is a great combination between the sauce and the roasted chicken. We ordered tiramisu and the banana bread pudding. I will not say they arent nice, but i cant appreciate both of the dessert."
French,Poulet,Poulet Outlet at Chinatown Point,1,40,5-Sep-13,The Oxtail De Bourguignon was tender and overall it was good. Portion is considered small even if you are a small eater.
French,Poulet,Not bad,1,40,4-Sep-13,"A friend brought me to the outlet situated at Chinatown Point. The ambience was not bad, but pretty crowded on a weekday afternoon. The lamb shank was relatively soft as compared to other places, and the roasted chicken was quite well marinated. I ended off the meal with tiramisu, that was to my delight, not too sweet and a satisfactory portion."
French,Poulet,Well roasted delicious chicken,1,40,29-Aug-13,"A friend brought me to Poulet at Great World City. We'd the signature dish - the roasted poulet and to my delight, it was well marinated and the sauce wasn't too rich. Definitely great price for a decent meal. I would certainly visit it again."
French,Poulet,Can't call it French but I loved the food,1,50,28-Jul-13,"Everytime I pass this nicely decorated restaurant, but their menu seems nothing attractive. The menu lacks proper pictures and description, but today I was determined to explore their food. So, I choose mushroom soup, Chicken and Fig In-between sandwich and iced lemonade. I was really not expecting anything amazing, but when I tested the food, I just loved it. I will certainly recommend this restaurant to everyone. I loved the food, service, restaurant decoration,atmosphere and above all their extremely reasonable price."
French,Poulet,Very tasy meal!,1,50,11-Jul-13,"We visited the Vivocity restaurant and at first were a little turned off by the queue to get in but we were seated in 10mins. The staff were great. We went back twice as the meals were so fantastic and flavoursome as well as beeing a good price. On our first vivit we shared the Salad de Paris... AMAZING! and for mails the Poulet roti (signiture chiken dish) and the Iberico Pork Belly both were lovely! Mash potato is so creamy! The sauce of the signiture chicken is quite rich though. It was super filling and was under $45 for two of us. Tip: glasses of water are 30cents each and they are warm, if you would like it cold you need to ask for a cup of ice! We went back twice and I would go again! I highly recommend it!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Nice and good price,1,50,10-Oct-18,"This is my 2nd time visit, very nice steak with unique sauce, and the price is very reasonable, worth for money"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great ambiance and excellent food. ,1,50,3-Oct-18,"My family has been going here for years. The food is fabulous and the service is always excellent. Though they only offer steak and fries as the main dish, there are many appetizers and desserts. You can view the menu on their website. I particularly recommend the French onion soup. The French fries are absolutely delicious and all you can eat. Highly recommended. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One menu item is all you need!,1,50,19-Sep-18,"Went here for a casual business lunch... what a great place.As far as I can tell, apart from the appetisers there is only one menu item which is steak and frites... and that’s just fine with me.Cute little place, reasonably priced with really great food."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money especially with time Chope voucher,1,40,18-Sep-18,We got a good deal at 50% off with Chope vouchers . Steak was great and generous free flow fries even better. Only gripe about the place is tables were incredulously close ! I would don’t estimate at most 15cm apart thus no privacy for those looking for a nice quiet date
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Very good value high quality meal,1,50,3-Sep-18,"Very good value (coupled with Chope’s discount). Starters, mains and wine all very well priced. Will definitely visit again"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good Steak and Fries,1,40,18-Aug-18,My steak was not the tastiest of steaks but it was cooked according to my request and it was lean. The fries were ample and very good. The sauce is also very good.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and fries!,1,50,14-Aug-18,"My husband and I have been here quite a few times, and the steak and fries is always excellent, and the sauce is the best! So we decided to go back on short notice last weekend. We forgot how good it is.. the steak is always very tender and the fries are crispy. If you order the regular portion, you get a few pieces of meat with lots of fries. Then when you manage to finish, you get more meat and more fries! For $35 (I think) this is just amazing. also, you get a salad with walnuts as a starter, and that's included in the price too. My husband always goes for the XXL portion, which is HUGE, but he somehow manages to finish it, this one is $55 I think. We love love love the place and will be back again soon!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,What a surprise!,1,50,10-Jul-18,"We literally fell upon L’Entrecote at Duxton Hill Singapore. We felt the need for a change & wandered to Duxton Hill just up from Maxwell Street. Such a surprise to come across an area without traffic and offering an alternate Singaporean experience. Loved loved loved our meal at this little French bistro. I am not a steak lover, but I cleaned my plate! Can’t rave enough about L’Entrecote and the Duxton Hill area. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Too cosy,1,40,2-Jul-18,"This restaurant could be every steak and fries fanatic’s dream come true or not, it really depends on how much of a food snob you are.The tables and seats were too closely positioned together for my comfort but if you can overlook that bit during a crowded evening, then you have my admiration! Making a table booking was seamless, finding a parking lot is a headache.The no-brainer dish to order is steak and fries, and it comes served to you in two portions; the second portion of meat is placed on the tiniest candle burner on a side table. Do not succumb to your desires of wolfing the steak down because there is no third portion of steak. Do not get your hopes up! The fries are, however, generously rained down on your plate if you request for it. I found the steak dressing an overkill, but that is just my palate. Do book in advance, or just get prepared to be turned away. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food and service!!,1,50,22-Jun-18,Food was great! Really liked that they left a bit of steak on a plate over a small fire to serve to us after we were about 15 min into our dinner so that the rest of the steak would still be hot. Good service too.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy French Bistro,1,50,11-Jun-18,"We met friends at L'entrecote for an impromptu dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant was full and buzzing when we arrived and we were welcomed warmly by the staff which set the standard for the superb service we received all night.The steak and fries were delicious (with the offer of unlimited fries being particularly dangerous!), as was the red wine and the three desserts we tried. A complementary Kir on arrival was a lovely touch too. We will definitely be back!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Sinful steak & fries,1,40,2-Jun-18,"This bistro style steak and fries place is a must visit if you want a relaxed evening without getting dressed to the nines.Just pull on your smart casuals and go there. Start with an order of buttered escargot. One of the best I have eaten. Dip chunks of bread into the butter sauce and enjoy the snails.For mains there are only 2 choices and of course you go for the steak & fries. The steak is covered in their signature sauce which you will definitely polish off with the fries after you are done with the meat. Admittedly my plate was as clean as Oliver Twist’s bowl. Greed has no limits and I enjoyed a House Dessert which was a white lava cake out of which oozed a whole lot of caramel sauce. Don’t miss it. Your visit will be incomplete.If you are in Singapore for a short trip or a long stay, do try to visit L’Entrecote. It’s worth it.Note: Go to the outlet at 36 Duxton Hill as it has indoor seating. The outlet at Orchard Road only has deck seating. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Always a nice French dinner experience ,1,40,29-May-18,"Hadn’t been there for a while , but it didn’t disappoint at all. Still the lovely French atmosphere and the food was delicious and still big portions . We also had nice appetizer and the must is the desert, lovely choices. A wonderful evening and for my Duxton is such a lovely place that this is my favorite location ."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Almost in Paris,1,50,20-May-18,"Very quaint little bistro for date night to reminisce of our time in Paris. Sure it was not the real deal but the food and ambience was a treat. Wait staff were superb, very attentive, service was fast despite the restaurant being full. We had the speciality, steak and fries, sauce was so yummy, we asked for seconds. The signature caramel lava cake and truffle brie topped the meal. Thank you for making our night special."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simply wonderful ,1,50,19-May-18,"I visited with my family for a birthday dinner after a friend recommended. I am soooo glad we took her advice!Firstly, the service was awesome. We arrived quite late on a Sunday night, about an hour before closing, but there was absolutely no sense of being rushed by the team. The waiting service was super charming, and attentive without being “in your face”. But the steak and fires....oh my days! We chose the standard size for 35 bucks (with free flow fries). Steak was cooked to perfection just how each of us liked it. When it was served, I thought the portion was perhaps a little small...but after I’d eaten most of the steak, along pops the waiter with the other half of the steak that they had kept perfectly warm!! Such a nice surprise for a hungry boy like me :) And the fries kept coming as promised.The side salad and bread were fresh and delicious too. And the small Carafe of Bordeaux was an absolute dream!I honestly can’t fault this place. In fact we are going back for our last dinner in Singapore tonight!! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Amazing!!!,1,50,15-Feb-18,"Went to this place on Valentines night with my partner. We ordered the standard steak dish, medium rare, with fries. It did not disappoint! At only $35, this was easily the best steak and fries I’ve ever had. Melt in the mouth meat, crispy fries, and more food than I could finish.Really lovely atmosphere too, we sat outside and enjoyed the buzzing courtyard and music from next door.I highly recommend this place!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,meat& freeflow fries ? hell yeah,1,50,6-Feb-18,"when i walkin down in duxton hill area i saw this resto and i decide to try they serve meat 150gr and 300gr and for the presentation they slice the meat into pieces and serve it with mustard sc and of course free flow fries!! great ambience ,good job!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Home made steak experience,1,50,29-Jan-18,Great ambience and excellent food. Kept simple with the fact that you only order steak and fries. Just pick the appetizers if needed. Desserts were great. Highly recommend the caramel lava cake.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,steak could be more tender,1,40,9-Jan-18,"i feel that for the amount paid, the food is value for money. the steak could be more tender but the sides, salad and sauce were good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Good food, value for money",1,50,30-Dec-17,"Food was good and value for money as the fries was free flow. Only complain if any is the space between the tables was very small, no privacy between other tables"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food with a great atmosphere,1,50,6-Dec-17,"Steak and fries, two of my favourite food paired with an amazing atmosphere and excellent customer service :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A welcoming restaurant with great French Cuisine,1,50,4-Dec-17,"We were there for the steak frites, which was rather good. The highlight was the French Onion Soup which our litttle girl loved a lot. Best highlight for the little lady was that they served her a complimentary nice non-alcoholic fruit punch and we had complimentary drinks too. A quiet relaxed ambience for a nice dinner, with excellent service which was not overly fussy. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great steak and fries,1,40,23-Nov-17,"Good ambience, food was served quickly, unlimited fries, price was alright around 40+ per pax. Only downside was you won’t be able to bring your own dessert"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Delish!,1,50,8-Nov-17,"The staff are brilliant, very efficient, very accommodating. The steak, sauce and fries are so delicious, that you continue to eat even if you are full from having a scrumptious starter. People wait for ages for a table without a booking, showing just how yummy the food is, but best to book in advance."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Big lover but too expensive ,1,40,1-Nov-17,"I have always loved the entrecôte style of cuisine, and I haven’t been disappointed of the quality of the food. Although the prices are way too high for this type of cuisine. It is a shame because I’m sure that the restaurant could attract more customers by lowering their prices..."

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Rare find for a Saturday lunch,1,50,24-Oct-17,Lucky to find this fantastic restaurant in Duxton Hill open for Saturday lunch when most other restaurants in the same area are closed.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Steak, frites, house Bordeaux, what's not to like?",1,40,18-Oct-17,"If a restaurant is going to only do one main course, it needs to do it well. I have tried similar establishments in other cities and after many times thinking about trying here we finally got around to it.We rocked up fairly early, sans reservation but got a table easily, however, had we been later it might have been different.No need for starters, straight to the chase. The only decision to make is how you want the steak cooked. I was surprised to see ""well done"" as an option - I went to a place in HK recently who stated they would only serve their steak rare or medium rare(!) - but we requested a point, and saignant (medium and medium rare) so that was fine. There was a fair wine list, but a bottle their own label Bordeaux looked the right choice and it was pretty decent.We toyed with our green salads with walnuts, they were OK, but salad is, well, rabbit food at the best of times.The steaks arrived after a suitable interval, plated up by the wait staff in the dining room and smothered in the Cafe de Paris sauce. And a few frites. Well, to be honest, a shed-load of frites. Verging on ""American"" serving. I would have preferred fewer and when we go back, as is highly likely, I will make the point of asking for less.Both were cooked well, and how I would have expected them outside France: in France medium rare is always closer to rare than say here.After making some inroads into the food, the waitress brought the rest of the steak and offered more frites: had I not eaten for a week I might have taken her up on it as they were good frites but having only the one stomach I passed.My only minor criticism was a slight lack of seasoning, but that is always to be expected in Singapore, the salt police have declared salt is A Bad Thing so I needed a touch more on mine.There was a dessert selection and having had the house main course, and the house red, we went for the house dessert to share, a salted caramel lava cake, a la mode. There was a warning that there would be 15 minute wait for said confection but that gave us time to reflect on the meal and begin digesting it.Dessert was quite reasonable and a good way to finish.Cost was pretty fair as well, $190 all in so as I say, somewhere to add to our rotation."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One choice,1,40,1-Oct-17,"French to the core. Only one dish, steak frites. Both came out perfectly cooked as ordered. I would've preferred to forego the sauce on top, but my wife loved the sauce. Horses for courses. Massive amount of crispy frites. Feed two armies on them. Not cheap, would not want to spend that much every night."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,So Parisien,1,40,27-Sep-17,What was excellent is just how people can combine great quality with little choice. Good steak with excellent sauce. And no nonsense about wine. Not something like what kind of wine so you want? No Bordeaux otherwise go somewhere else. Had a very enjoyable evening with a reasonable bill. 
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Does what it says! French steak and chips!,1,40,23-Sep-17,"Not sure why this place gets low ratings. You can see that it serves steak and chips with a lovely sauce and lots of lovely wines sitting outside in cool Duxton Hill.Service was pretty good, nice place to chill and relax and do some business."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak to my heart...,1,40,22-Sep-17,"Ordered the onion soup, and for mains I had the classic steak and fries, which comes with a nice side salad so you get your greens too! Clue is in the name, for the mains your only selection is pretty much only steak and fries! You do get to choose between a regular or XL portion though. Go big or go home, full of yummy steak in ya belly... "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,As expected,1,40,24-Aug-17,"Very nice people, great steak and fries, good chocolate mousse.
This is a place that doesn't disappoint."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great ambience,1,40,23-Aug-17,"Great ambiance, not over the top for casual dining. The steak wasn't exactly medium rare as requested (all of ours tasted medium well), but the sauce and fries were really good. Great service and we loved the rosé we had as a welcome drink!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Love the free flow fries!,1,50,23-Aug-17,"This place is best for fries and steak. If you love your steak and fries, this is the place to go. They are very generous with the steak. You can always ask for top up for your fries whenever you are done. Good place for hangout with friends. Recommended to make reservations before heading down. "

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cozy ambiance. No frills down right good stuff,1,40,7-Aug-17,"Steaks are well prepared. Went for the XXL size and it's rewarding. Cooked just the way I wanted it. Fries I suspect were from the freezer, but still ok."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant experience,1,40,30-Jul-17,"Had a pleasant experience dining at L'Entrecote. Ordered 3 appetizers (french onion soup, foie gras pâté and escargots) and the XXL portion of steak frites to be shared among us two. The soup was great, foie gras pâté was huge but delectable and the escargots were normal. The steak was tender but we were not fans of their special sauce which was a tad sour for our liking. Ambience and service were great though."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistent in their food quality and service,1,50,28-Jul-17,"We frequent this restaurant often and the service and food is always good. The french onion soup is delicious. We normally get the steal frites and if not too full, we get a caramel lava cake. Be careful not to order too many appetizers or you will be too full for dessert. The house red is also very good. Highly recommended making a reservation if you plan to go as it gets quite busy. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Price for Good Steak,1,50,18-Jul-17,"charming little establishment with friendly wait staff, the main draw here is the affordable steak that's for a pretty good standard, paired with free flow of fries and a starter salad. will definitely come back here again"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Enjoyable experience,1,50,6-Jul-17,"The steak was cooked quite well and the fries were addictive. The sauce, as advertised, was legendary and went well with both steak and fries. Desserts were good too."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Bistro on Duxton Hill,1,40,28-Jun-17,"Great experience in Duxton, simple menu, great service and a good wine list.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent burger!,1,40,13-Jun-17,"First time i had lunch in an outside place in Singapore but they have a very good ac-system. My food was really good but I missed a little salad with the burger. Other than that, reasonably priced, very friendly and swift service. Excellent for a quick lunch!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Delicious French Bistro fare,1,50,12-Jun-17,Whatever L'Entrecote puts into their steak sauce it makes a to-die-for sauce! Simply the best steak & frites & secret sauce in Singapore. Topped off with a fabulous caramel sauce pudding in the style of a fondant au chocolat. Such a treat.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Efficient Service, Food was great!",1,50,30-May-17,"Very neat restaurant, fancy layout but simple yet delicious steak and fries just like their shop name. Love it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Once again a very good lunch...,1,50,24-May-17,Have been here for business lunches on many occassions - the service is always very good and the food - although simple - is always great!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good for couple alone time on non-peak hours,1,40,14-May-17,"Everything was wonderful except for the sittings. The tables were too packed closely to each other, didn't have enough privacy for talking."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,No Words,1,50,9-May-17,"I do not need to say much about this place as many people will have visited at one of their locations and know their secret sauce. This is a franchise and I had previously visited in Canary Wharf. It was perfect for our first night in Singapore, good food with ample portion size. No one else in my party had been to L'Entrecote previously and they were impressed and will return to a home location. The setting is really romantic and the service was fabulous. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,quite decent French food,1,40,8-May-17,Food is not bad at all. Some starters are good (foie gras terrine) and more interesting than main courses. The place can be very noisy at times.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Not bad,1,40,8-May-17,Food is good. Service is good. Just that the place is very cramp. Overall not bad. Will visit again if there's a chance. :)
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,The steak!,1,40,5-May-17,Loved the steak with the sauce. Sauce truly made the dish. Fries were nice and crisp. The salty caramel cake was the perfect way to end the meal.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent food and service,1,50,3-May-17,There are no words that can explain the experience you receive in this bistro. The food is amazing and the service was perfect. I highly recommend this place!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Consistently Very GOOD!!,1,50,12-Apr-17,Our go-to-place to get our Steak-fix. Always good quality and very yummy!!! Good value for money :))
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent,1,50,8-Apr-17,"This was our second visit. As we both adore the vast arrangement of the desserts, we opted to share a main, and share 3 desserts ! The steak was beautiful, perfectly cooked to our requirements. We were advised that as we were sharing a main, that ""free flow"" of fries would not be available, but we could not finish the huge amount that was served to us! The desserts are stunning, great choice and a good size. A joy to return. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great,1,40,28-Mar-17,"Had a high expectation on the Wagyu ribeye but it wasn't as good as expected, which wasn't value for the money. I requested for a small surprise for my Boyfriend's birthday and the staff assisted me for it. Service was excellent! And for those who love fries, they do top up fries for free!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food and great service,1,50,22-Mar-17,"This restaurant only has one main dish, steak and delicious unlimited, all-you-can-eat French fries, but they have several appetizers and desserts. I try to eat mainly vegetarian, so just had bread, cheese and salad and then French onion soup as my main even though it has beef broth. The only other two vegetarian options are endive salad (with blue cheese and walnut) and the classic Parisien leek & vinaigrette, which I have not had, so cannot comment. They are very child friendly and in a lovely location. Definitely recommended. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent food ... disappointing wine.,1,40,20-Mar-17,"L'Entrecote have some of the best steak and chips in Singapore, and the prices are good. The formula is adjusted slightly from the original restaurants in Paris and London - they offer starters in Singapore, and the seating is less ""intimate"". However, it still works - the restaurant is a favourite for me.The wine however is awful. Super ordinary (and super cheap) French and Aussie wine is priced up to $100+ a bottle and it spoils the experience somewhat. It's strange as the L'Entrecote Wine Bar next door (which also sells steaks, and presumably shares the kitchen) has a good wine list. A new sommelier or wine buyer is urgently needed!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great fries & wine - steak okay - limited vegetarian options,1,40,20-Mar-17,"We came here for an early dinner on a Sunday with our 3 kids - 2 are steak eaters, 1 is a vegetarian. It didn't occur to me to check the menu in advance but there are VERY limited options for vegetarians - basically onion soup, salad and fries.The meat eaters in our group enjoyed the steak, though it was a bit chewy and didn't seem to be a great cut of meat. However we enjoyed the ambiance, fries, and house wine. Welcome drinks were a nice touch. Service was great (though there were only 2 other diners at the time we were there).I'd come here again with friends instead of kids and soak up the ambiance. :)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Tasty,1,40,19-Mar-17,"We went there early thus the service very attentive. Nice touch that they gave complimentary rosè wine. Ordered the steak with fries. Their steak sauce was a touch acidic (sour), too sour for my liking. The French fries was cooked well, well seasoned and crispy."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and good,1,40,14-Mar-17,"Good ambiance, great food, nice service.
We enjoyed a drink before the meal, then we had the usual entrecote with fries, which was just right, then we finished with dessers which were real good."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great place for steak,1,40,26-Feb-17,"If you enjoy steak and fries but hate paying absurd prices... this is a great place to visit! The steak is more minute steak with a very nice sauce, fries are all you can eat and you feel like in a tiny French restaurant... Definitely a new addition to our regular places! "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Unlimited fries (and steak!),1,40,14-Feb-17,"I've read everywhere online that this place is amazing for steak and fries - I mean how can they not be, if that's the only thing on their mains menu? I also read that they have unlimited fries, and not only did they deliver on that, they also gave everyone extra steak! Not sure if it was just the weekend that I went (which was the weekend right before Valentine's Day), but no complaints here!The restaurant itself is extremely crowded and you're barely 20cm away from the next table because they cram a table into every single area available, but their turnover is super fast and they're very efficient. The ambience and food is so good that after a while you forget the crowdedness anyway.Overall, great food, great service and I would totally come back again!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,What's not to like ,1,50,21-Jan-17,Classic steak frites place - a complimentary glass of kir to start. They do have a menu but most people go for the salad with walnut to start followed by the steak frites - enough steak for 2 portions and as many fries as you can eat. Wash it all down with a bottle (or 2) of the house red!
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Nice time spent with friends, but the steak could be better",1,40,17-Jan-17,"The steak was not as good as expected as it was pretty dry. But overall the service and environment is nice. Their sparkling water is surprisingly not free, so be cautious when the waitress asks you whether you want water or sparkling water."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent steak and chips,1,40,17-Jan-17,"This is a small place, but if you want a great steak and chips then look no further. The meal was delicious, cooked to perfection and I could easily go back for more. My friend and I did not experience any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned - we were served well, and ate at our leisure. The whole Duxton Hill area was really nice too. It has a really relaxed atmosphere with a huge variety of restaurants and bars with flavours and options from all over the world. Would like to explore more."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Just Like Eating in Paris,1,40,6-Jan-17,"I'm a big fan of the Paris chain Le Relais de L'Entrecote, which offers a simple menu of salad, steak and frites along with a mustard based sauce. Well, Singapore's L'Entrecote absolutely nails it! It's not as good as it's Paris counterpart, but pretty darn close. I wasn't disappointed, and would go back anytime. They have a decent wine list, as well. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,L entrecôte,1,50,3-Jan-17,I booked the restaurant last minute but they were very accommodating. French onion soup and steak was very good
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Quality Food,1,40,28-Dec-16,The quality of the food and service is pretty good. The only thing lacking is the space between tables. Very narrow even for petite size.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Cosy atmosphere,1,40,23-Dec-16,Love the service by the.. manager? Really attentive and nice. Beef steak was great as always! Love it
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Always good steak,1,40,21-Dec-16,"We have tried other steak restaurants in Singapore but keep coming back to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill. The steak is always trimmed of fat, cooked exactly as requested, the sauce always tasty and the portions a good size. The service is always at a high standard. Fridays and Saturdays are always busier with the nearby bars open, but it is very quiet and easy to get a table on Sunday nights."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Dining experience at L'Entrecote,1,50,12-Dec-16,"Had a very good experience there, just that I didn't know they charge for the water. But for the price, it's totally worth it."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak and reasonably priced,1,40,11-Dec-16,"Good food and ambience, steak was good and the fries was so yummy, my profiteroles dessert was so so good. price was not too bad, will definitely come back"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food with excellent atmosphere,1,50,8-Dec-16,Its a good place to go to if you want a quiet evening with your other half. It comes with a complimentary drink when you first enter.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and fries with great sauce :),1,40,1-Nov-16,"Went today for lunch and really enjoyed it. Getting a second helping of steak and fries was a big bonus. The sauce was also great. I would ask for a better choice of wine by the glass for the lunch crowd tho. As a bottle at lunch is not the best idea for a productive afternoon. I could imagine it would get pretty cramped when busy as the tables are so close together that you have to move them to get to the bench seats. And even then anyone to large may be knocking over glasses!Would defo go back, as $35 for good steak frites is pretty reasonable."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Straightforward, well cooked food",1,50,28-Sep-16,"Chose for a birthday celebration, knowing the entire family enjoys steak.Chose French Onion Soup to begin, which was delicious. Medium-rare steak very good, but more like a rare steak in Australia. The boys devoured. Great, morish French fries and for once, I didn't have to finish everyone else's. They ate them all.Desserts were all good, but not the standard of the steak frites.Quite pricey, but beef is expensive in Singapore.Good service. Will return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Classic steak et frites in a relaxing environment,1,40,8-Sep-16,"The location of this restaurant is so relaxing which memories of old Singapore. The menu is pretty simple with steak et frites front and centre. And why not, for a once in while unhealthy meal with unlimited chips? House wines are good and the wine list boasts a few gems. Staff were friendly and attentive. Don't call to book a table - they don't answer their phone?! THe lemon sorbet with limoncello was a nice way to finish the meal."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Steak and Fries,1,40,3-Sep-16,"I found a listing for E'ntrecote at Duxton Hill in the Singapore Good Food Guide, and decided to try it out. Quite a few bars and restaurants in the pedestrianised part of Duxton Hill. I live in Singapore but I wasn't aware of these fine restaurants until the other evening.Arrived by taxi and walked up the pedestrianised section until I reached the restaurant. Midweek and very few diners so got a table easily. Nice albeit narrow - we were seated near to the air conditioning. Ordered snails for starters - fantastic - full of garlic and most flavoursome. For the main event I ordered steak - it was medium well cooked, and came with French Fries - just as I ordered. Whilst I have nothing but praise for the food I was served, my colleague was less impressed with her order of mussels. The mussels were incredibly small - they were European and not the New Zealand version which are often served in restaurants. Had I ordered them I would have been unhappy too, so keep away from the mussels. For dessert I ordered cream caramel - again that was a wonderful choice.I called in advance to reserve a table and was told that it was not possible, however it is possible to reserve via the Trip Advisor app - which worked well. Free wifi, good service and nice ambiance. Certainly an enjoyably meal.Turn left outside the restaurant and walk down the hill through the car park and you will find a ready supply of taxis. "
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,AMAZING,1,50,14-Jul-16,"This was simply amazing. Such a cool vibe, loved the food and had the best time with my boyfried here! Highly recommended. It's seriously a MUST in Singapore. Affordable and super tasty!"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,bon appétit,1,40,17-Jun-16,"Seriously this place has one of the best steak frites I have eaten, authentic and rustic. The wag you was great and the sauce was just right. It Coates well, my friends and I had the caramel lava cake after a heavy meal and thought so that it's the best in Singapore for a fondant or some call it a couldn't in one of those Michelin Starred Restaurant. We have enjoyed the food and great service.."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Excellent service with housepour wines by the bottle,1,50,30-Mar-16,It is definitely worth trying here if you're a fan of French wines. Tried their specialty steak with free-flow fries and it was amazing. Only issue is they don't accept reservations which is a bummer for organized people. Would definitely come back again.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Specialised,1,40,4-Feb-16,By taking one dish and making it extraordinary L'entrecote excel in what they do. No pretence in trying to go beyond their specialty make their food divine.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Birthday Dinner,1,40,15-Dec-15,"We were in singapore during my gf's birthday. so I was picking something that aren't too expensive but wasn't too bad. The steak was recommended on a random blog I came across and the photo looked really good. It was a steak with fries. The steak was amazing!! Although it didn't look too good in picture, but it was absolutely wonderful. Too bad we only ordered one because we wanted to try other food. So we ordered the mussles too, but it wasn't that good. We also had escargot but they forgot about it so our appetizer turned into our dessert. It was hard to find because we didn't know our ways, and it was located in a mall next to some superstore. Good to try, but probably not going to go again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple Steak and Chips...Perfect!!!!,1,40,13-Oct-15,"A nice cosy restaurant with a section next door. Was very busy next door, and as we didn't have a reservation, staff were helpful to give us a small table near the bar.Food was very nice, and the highlight was the pate they had on the platter we had as an appetizer.Nice simple menu, steak and chips, or a fish option. I went for the steak, and did ask the what Entrecote steak was, but was unsure even after I was told. It was a striploin steak, and mine was perfectly cooked to medium. Nice and juicy. Although I do prefer to cut the steak myself, but it was served already cut, Wasn't a big deal as the steak was nice.A slight mix up with the orders of my other friends on the table, but were very accommodating and remade the orders, and even gave us a free round of drinks."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak!,1,40,13-Sep-15,"The best steak in a long while, been here for the third time. Menu is straightforward and easy to understand, standard is consistent - always great service, memorable place. Lunch and dinner has the same quality service"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Will be back for more,1,40,12-Jul-15,"Went there for a date with my girlfriend, ambience was very nice, very private. Place was very classy. Went to the outlet at Suntec City. We had the l'entrecote steak & fries, Caesar salad & escargots. Steak was cooked to the right doneness for me, but a little too rare for my girlfriend, fries was good and when it was last order we requested for more fries, they served it freshly cooked. Awesome, great service from the staff as well, recommended to visit, but not a fan of the escargots there. They probably should serve some bread first as the steaks took quite awhile. Thank god we had appetizers."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Value for money,1,40,1-Jul-15,"Went with a group of all-girl friends to the Suntec outlet. The lady manager was very friendly and joked with us. Not packed on a weekday night, so at least it's not so noisy and stressful.Price was very reasonable, with mains at only S$20. Appetizers and desserts were also decently priced. Loved the salty caramel lava cake. And the half baked chocolate cake - not too sweet like most lava cakes.Only disappointment is the Foie Gras, which was a terrain instead of the pan-fried version."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great food,1,50,7-Jun-15,"They offer a lunch special for $20.95++ which is a starter, main course and a soft drink. I had the walnut salad and the steak and it was delicious.
I would certainly go back again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great Food and Great Service,1,40,5-Jun-15,"The restaurant has good vibes, waiters are polite and the food is delicious. they have their ""special"" sauce for the steaks which is really delicious and the size of the dishes is satisfying."

typical french food, starters like patee or onion soup, main course only entrecote with fries and salad, excellent !!!!
nice deserts, wine etc.....
great experience, reasonable price"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Pleasant surprise,1,40,16-May-15,"** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec City (Fountain area)**We found this place pretty much by accident as we were looking for a place for lunch after a fair at the Convention Centre.It was pretty busy so we figured it should be good. And it didn't disappoint.We had the lunch set (steak frites) and also a roast chicken main meal. The set was value for money as it came with salad, steak with fries, soft drink and a dessert of the day. Even though we only had a dessert, they were kind enough to let us share- giving us an extra set of cutlery without the need for asking.

And it serves a great Parisian breakfast. I chose the eggs benedict with salmon and it was a best bet. I highly recommend. Freshly backed croissant, tasty coffee, freshly squeesed orange juice. Beautiful pedestrian street, quiet. A perfect start for a sunday with family. Cheers. Vincent"

But
We would definitely go again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Simple menu, simple food",1,40,13-Dec-14,"The simplest menu I have ever seen, made choosing of the food much faster. We started of with the famous escargots, which I thought was delicious! The main course is just one in the menu, which is steak and fries. The steak was cooked to my liking, perfect medium rare and the fries were thin and crisp. We didnt get a dessert because we were too stuff! I will go back there again. "

When the steak came with its fries and salad and the sauce it was perfectly cooked and the taste was great. Although I couldn't actually eat desert I had to try the one with the icecream, the merinque and chocolate sauce - and that is also one which should be tried :-)"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Keeping life simple,1,40,2-Oct-14,"If it's a steak you want. Steak you'll get. Simple concept. Flat fee for steak (either small or large) it's the ONLY entree: with add-ons for appetisers and deserts. Lively venue, not too noisy, with a good ambience and decor. A smart set of diners. Worth a visit. Good value for business lunches; date night and groups of friends.Like the option of carafes for the wine; as you can switch between courses. Tres bon."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good value steak,1,40,5-Sep-14,"Very decent steak for the price. The strips are just the way they should be and you probably either love it or hate it, thin, content less and a little bit like chewing paper. The steak on the other hand was lean, without tendon but tasteful. Avoid the heavy sauce and just go for the steak and walnut salad."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Carnivore’s dream come true,1,40,30-Aug-14,"As an avowed carnivore, L’Entrecôte is my idea of heaven- the only main course is steak! Not just any steak though, a mouth-watering entrecôte steak accompanied by a fresh green salad and refillable fries, at the end of the meal we were completely full. Although located in Duxton Hill, the atmosphere of L’Entrecôte reminded me of a Bistro I used to visit in Paris (tables very close to each other, waiters running around, plenty of glasses of wine on each table!) reflecting the authenticity of the restaurant."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good steak !!!,1,40,2-Aug-14,"They only have 1 main course and for good reason ... Its perfect !

The restaurant does not take reservations and its actually a good thing !"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good Food and Service,1,50,21-Jun-14,"I can see a mix of good and bad reviews here. Firstly, I use the palate card that offers 50% discount when dining with one other. So that makes the meals here extremely reasonable. With regards to the water on offer, we always opt for the normal water as opposed to the still or sparkling options.I always order the steak and fries while my wife orders the chicken dish. Both are always good, we like the free flow of fries that come with the steak though you have to ask for it or they will not be refilled.Service is good and we always leave this place happy. Have yet to experience the bad service experienced by the other reviewers."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore,1,40,16-May-14,"Have eaten here 3 times. Love love the steak and fries. Not the best steak I've ever had but still very tasty. Portions are huge especially after they come with seconds. Love the buzz, ambience and décor of this restaurant. It is ideal for a group of friends to meet up for a weekend dinner. Wouldn't recommend for a couple as the tables are very very close together so lack of privacy."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,C'est une expérience fantastique,1,50,11-May-14,"Dined at the suntec outlet on the eve of Mother's Day - it was such a wonderful experience. The food was awesome - we ordered the steak & duck confit as main - both are very good especially the steak - the sauce is so unique, the meat is so good. As for the appetizer - don't miss the pâte - it was so smooth - it just melt in your mouth, it goes so well with the bread. Dessert is heavenly - chocolate lava, profiteroles, and vanilla ice cream - are so amazing. The suntec outlet also has a really nice bistro feel....feel like I'm in Paris :)) service is excellent too. I'll certainly return :)"

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good food & great service,1,40,30-Mar-14,"As the one we know for years at Rue du Débarcadère in Paris, we found in Singapore the good traditional French food in a friendly ambiance. We enjoyed its traditional one meal which is steak with french fries. The paté de Campagne and the rillettes de canard have to be tried as well as the tarte Tatin and the île flottante."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Best value steak in Singapore,1,50,11-Feb-14,"We've been to the Duxton branch twice now and if steak frites is your thing it's well worth it. As the name implies, there's only one main course, entrecote either a large or very large portion with ""free flow"" fries and a green salad. On both occasions the steak has been cooked exactly as we all liked it and service is polite and attentive.There's a good choice of French starters and desserts. We've enjoyed the starters, I've gone for the snails both times, such that he staff remembered the second time. We've never got as far as the desserts. Wine choice is good though we've only ever had the house red and white, which has been good value.The bistro decor all adds up to the Parisien feel, even if we are 6,000 miles away. Well worth it compared to some much more expensive options."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A nice change,1,40,3-Dec-13,Dinner here was a nice change from the Asian dining I had been doing for a few weeks. The steak was tender though a bit drowned in sauce. A complimentary glass of Kir was a nice start. The staff offered more fries. Meal comes with a green salad.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Great steak and seconds too,1,50,1-Nov-13,"Reading other reviews there must be more than one L'entrecote in Singapore. This is the one just off Duxton Road. Went with 3 others. You cannot book, but midweek there was no queue. We had the speciality of the house - which everyone else seemed to be having. Excellent rare, succulent steak, delicious bearnaise sauce and great chips. The best bit was, just as you thought you had eaten it all, they refilled your plate! Great house red at a reasonable price too. Fantastic."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Good restaurant: Does what it says on the tin!,1,40,4-Sep-13,"We arrived without booking and were asked to wait a few minutes outside with a drink while they got a table ready. The place is is a nice area and has local charm. I can't say that the lady Maitre D' (Maitresse D'?) was effusive with her welcome but my goodness, she was briskly efficient and the serving team were well drilled. Once seated, we had our order taken immediately - not hard, they do steak and frites only - and there was a glass of wine in my hand within seconds. Just what I needed. The food arrived very quickly: The meat was perfectly cooked, flavoursome and tender too, the sauce rich without being overpowering and the fries were not over-salted. The portions were generous; I couldn't eat all of the meal. Good value for money. Very happy indeed and would return."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Top notch French food in Singapore,1,50,26-Jun-13,"Excellent choice if you are tired of the local fare. One item on the menu, steak and their secret sauce, unlimited french fries"
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak & Fries; that's it,1,40,26-May-13,"This is a steak and fries resto and they offer nothing else. So you must like steak to come here. The staff, most especially the Westerners, can get snooty. They do not accept reservations except for big groups. We once booked a big table for 10 and they wouldn't let us sit down, even if they already reserved our table for us. We were about 6 already and the snooty Westerner waiter wouldn't let us sit. What's the point??? They already reserved our table and our companions were 10 minutes away. Plus we were celebrating 3 birthdays. They could be more flexible and service oriented in this sense. But I doubt they would care, because a lot of people go there. But there are better places to go to in the area, so they'd better improve.In addition, the place is TINY, and the tables are sooo close to each other so you really have no privacy. In fact, it's sooo cramped that they have to pull out the table to let you sit on the cushioned seats near the wall. Yes, that small."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Steak and Fries Bistro,1,40,22-May-13,"You get what the name says - steak and fries and it's a bistro not a 5 star restaurant. So, if you are looking for something simple yet tasty, this place is worth your time and money. I've been here twice with my husband and would definitely come back whenever we feel like 'steak and fries' The serving size is good and the sauce they put on the steak is very yummy. If you finish your fries, they'll stock it up again."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,"Great steak, fun experience",1,50,10-Apr-13,"Really love steak so the concept of this restaurant really appealed to me. The starters and desert list were great too and the choice was a lot wider. Nice house wine and great atmosphere in restaurant. Wouldn't recommend if you don't like sitting close to other people, but I didn't find it a problem because everyone is chatting away so not the kind of place people are listening into your conversations."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Easy menu,1,50,11-Mar-13,The l'entrecote in Singapore is a good place when you like steak and frites. The Restaurant is in good location and easy to reach. Might be busy during weekends as they do not take reservations.
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple But good,1,40,10-Mar-13,"If you like steak frites, then this is a must try.

French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Simple and great - a gem in the heart of Singapore,1,40,6-Jan-13,"My wife and I were able to take a night out leaving the kids with the family during our trip though Singapore from Bangalore. We were looking for a classic, simple no fuss restaurant and loved the atmosphere at L'Entrecote. Service was quick and friendly but not intrusive, the food was perfect and a nice but small wine list. A little gem in the heart of Singapore."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,A Little Piece of Paris in Singapore,1,40,5-Nov-12,"L'Entrecote Singapore provides an almost-perfect version of Parisian entrecote - right down to the great vibe, crowded seating, single choice of main course (and house Burgundy), free-flowing fries - and excellent entrecote and sauce. The coffee is good, the deserts excellent. The only thing lacking is visible, strong management. The staff are mostly efficient, but not perfect. A bit of training - and a personable, highly-visible, hands-on, experienced manager with a Parisian accent would turn this place from four stars into five.Note: If you've not tried entrecote before, don't go here expecting a range of main courses. The steak is why you go here. If you want a greater range, there are other places that do this - if you want steak frites with a great sauce, and only that, come here."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,First time visit to Singapore's L'entrecote,1,40,15-Oct-12,"We have visited L'entrecote in Geneva several times, and it one of our favourite places to eat when we are there. However, as we are now living in Singapore we decided to go to the newly opened Singaporean version, and compare. Our first impressions were good as we were met at the door by a friendly staff member, most Singaporeans are friendly though, and he guided us to a table. All the tables, at both Geneva and Singapore, are very close together, so be warned if you are expecting the usual space between you and the next table. The service is very swift, at both places, and our 'waitress' came to our table very quickly to take our order. We asked that the food not be brought out until we had finished our aperitif, but they brought it out too soon, before we had got half way through our drinks, so we sent it back, and they apologised. The wine selection is excellent and we enjoyed an enjoyable Australian vintage--but then we are fans of Australian wine, so are unashamedly biased. The food is very good as the steaks were cooked as we asked, and the sauce for the steaks (that's all you can order) was as good as that at Geneva. However, in Singapore they don't give you a fresh plate when you've finished the first steak and chips, as they do in Geneva, and we prefer the Geneva way--yes, you have two portions of both anyway, so go hungry.The staff are great here, we had fun, and they are much more friendly than in Geneva, where you really have to work at communicating with the staff.The bill was very reasonable for what we had. So, which did we prefer, Geneva or Singapore? Well, without a doubt, it has to be Singapore, as we had a great evening there. So, will we be going back? Yes, definitely."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Comfort food!,1,40,16-Sep-12,"L'Entrecote is located at the increasingly trendy Duxton Hill area. I frequent this French bistro about once a month as it is consistently good. There is only one main course to speak of (steak & french fries) but a variety of excellent starters (and desserts) to choose from. They don't take reservations (which I think is good) and the idea is to stop by for a quick meal to satisfy your steak & fries craving rather than a long drawn-out 4 course meal. You get the feeling that they want to turn tables quickly (which is fair enough). The service is good nevertheless.Last night we started with a bottle of their house red - a generic Bordeaux that carries the L'Entrecote label. We were sitting in the outside area watching the place fill-up (it's been full every time I've visited). We were a little disappointed by the wine: under-ripe, unoaked red with too much Merlot probably. But for $49 you can't really complain.We moved inside and moved onto a lovely 2010 Cotes du Rhone which at $99 was still excellent value I think. One criticism I do have of the place is the rather small servings - I either have to order 2 starters (plus the main) or a starter and 2 mains (!). I can highly recommend the roasted bone marrow on toast with sea salt - the best I've tasted in Singapore! The escargots are similarly very good.As for the 'plat du jour', the beef is juicy and tender and cooked to your preference ('bleu' for me) but the frites are rather mediocre and could be much better.In summary, a lovely place and I look forward to going back."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Second time around and just as good,1,40,11-Sep-12,"We like the Duxton Hill area of Singapore and L'Entrcote is a great spot for a meal - as long as you like steak and fries! The restaurant does tend to have the tables close together, but both times we were the it was 50% full and perfectly fine. Nice touch is that salad comes first as a starter and there is a second portion of steak coming your way too."
French,L_Entrecote_The_Steak_Fries_Bistro,Duxton Hill French Bistro,1,40,9-Aug-12,"We enjoyed a recent trip to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill after a recommendation by a friend who had just returned from Singapore. Cute little renovated bistro very reminiscent of Fance Soir in Melbourne and thousands of actual bistros in France. We all decided on the signature salad, steak and fries. Green salad came first and was followed by a plate two thirds covered with French Fries. The steak was perfectly cooked to order and came already sliced into strips with the very tasty rich sauce. Tables quite close together in the French style so could not help but hear and notice Irish fellow next to us making a ""chip butty"" with his fries and bread roll. Wine list was quite good with many price points. We shared two desserts of chocolate fondant cake and tarte tatin. Both great tasting, but the tarte was a base of thick cake, not pastry, but perhaps this is a method that lasts longer in the heat and humidity of Singapore. All in all a fun night."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good steak!,1,40,11-Aug-18,"I went here many times and also another restaurant on Club street, every time I ordered a ribeye steak. Last night it was a bit too fatty but it was tasty as usual. Most of the times their steaks and chips were very good and I liked the side salad too. Very reasonable price for food and wine, staff were efficient."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great place for dinner!,1,50,10-Apr-18,"The steak is great! Nice place for dinner, very clean, the food was great, and the atmosphere was very nice. Great place to eat and spend few hours at night."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good meal in very pleasant surroundings,1,40,1-Apr-18,"Visited here with my wife - I had a sirloin steak and she had the duck, both of us were surprised at the size of our meat helpings - more than my wife was able to eat! The meat was cooked to our preference whilst the cook cam to check that my wife's duck was cooked the way she liked it. We had a salad included with our meals which was tasty and 'free flowing chips' we both already had more than enough with our order. The staff were friendly throughout he evening and we wold certainly return here."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best supper during my stay in Singapore,1,50,1-Mar-18,"I made an online reservation prior to my visit to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday in Singapore. We ordered the Giant “Cote de Boeuf” (Prime Rib) 1Kg, one of the ""specials of the house,"" which came with a bowl of salad, bread, and free flow of french fries. The prime rib cooked medium both looked and tasted so good we couldn't stop eating! At the end of the meal, we ordered a chocolate cake, which came on a nicely decorated plate with a message ""happy birthday"" (I asked them if they could do a little surprise on our dessert plate through email when I made the reservation!). The staffs were friendly and generous throughout our stay and undoubtedly nice enough to celebrate and take pictures of us for my boyfriend's birthday. They definitely succeeded at making us walk out of the restaurant with our stomachs full, hearts warm, and lots of smiles! Access is also great as it's located along the river, so you can take a nice 15-minute walk to Clark Quay station. Again, thank you so much for everything. Will definitely come back again (from Japan!):)"

I passed it, looked at the menu and thought ""Why not?""Good decision. After being well welcomed, I decided to go for the duck and ordered a bottle of red bojo (chilled, perfect)The chef came out to chat and how specifically I wanted my duck cooked. Nice touch and shows a good sense of precision and service.It arrived absolutely spot on. Delicious. And with the most perfect fries, à volonté, everyone's a winner.Lovely food, lovely wine and great service. I couldn't finish a whole bottle of bojo so sent a glass in to the chef to say thanks.

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Deliciously affordable steak,1,40,9-Aug-17,"Eating steaks can be an expensive business, but you needn’t spend big money to eat good ones.Although not cheap-as-chips, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche is a quaint little French restaurant at Robertson Quay. Although I had a placed a reservation, the table I was allocated was in a twilight zone spot of the restaurant….partially inside and partially outside the restaurant. I ended up being moved to three different tables that one evening. That would have, on a normal night, spoiled my mood and appetite but the restaurant manager – Valentine, was absolutely gracious throughout and did his best to ensure we have a good experience.Now about the food…you can demolish either the grilled rib eye steak with “vigneron” butter or grilled sirloin steak with herbs, both served with Mixed Salad & Free Flow of Home Made French Fries. Either one and you will end the evening feeling pretty damn satisfied.I need to tell you about the fries. They are cooked in duck fat. Duck, fat and fries are three words that please most people. Combining them is a very beautiful thing. There’s no looking back once you have tried these brown and crispy fries.While not quite as revelatory as the hype might suggest, Les Bouchons Rive Gauche certainly dishes out good steaks. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"

The staff were wonderful, the service fast, the steaks perfectly cooked and the salads and bread delicious. Each steak comes with a good sized side salad, a lot of fries and a selection of four sauces as well as a complimentary bread basket. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth and only cost 39 dollars! Not bad at all. The creme brulee was excellent and I could have easily closed my eyes and been eating and drinking along the Seine in Paris. Highly recommend this place."

Food was good with not too expensive price tag. Service was friendly and exceptionally fast. Menu is short and simple so the kitchen is able to meet the demand. Hint: make a table reservation online especially on a weekend night - even if it was just an hour before your dining time.

Nothing to boast about the outside view as it was all cordoned off with. However the cozy ambience in the restaurant could make up. It was not a decadent deco, just warm and relaxing surroundings with kopitiam chairs, simple list of menu and bits of French posters.The restaurant wait staff are helpful, Restaurant Manager is friendly and can provide good recommendation. We ordered a ribeye steak and sirloin steak. They are quite huge (approx. 200-300 grams). Served with generous portion of salad and fries. Steaks are great, delicious and a real value for money. I asked them to change the fries to salad and I received two large portion of salad, the service staff accommodated to my request happily. Genuine, hearty food. They have quite extensive options for wine, but their house wine was wonderful! I have never enjoyed red wine as smooth as theirs. The dessert was unassumingly fantastic. I love how the cherries was soaked and drenched in brandy with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. This is a little heaven."

French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,You get what you pay for.,1,40,13-Mar-16,"Singapore is known to give you steak at super small sizes. Atleast here with the hefty price tag, you get genuine service and the steak is nice and big."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,All good except...,1,40,17-Feb-16,"I ordered my steak to be charred on the outside and rare on the inside and got the waitress rudely rolling her eyes at me with the 'oh, another stupid Singaporean with a stupid order' look on her face. She thought I didn't see it but I did."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Couldn't better the steak,1,50,14-Feb-16,"Lovely setting, excellent service, food was very tasty and well cooked, my very rare fillet steak melted in the mouth. Dessert options good and were well worth having"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Valentine's Day ,1,40,14-Feb-16,"The steak was really juicy and well grilled, was juicy with the surface grilled just nice to give that slight yummy crispy coating. the classic Parisian bistro decor to the authentic menu- every detail has been meticulously thought out and beautifully rendered. The waitstaff were attentive and the wine here - they have a great selection too. The price is reasonable as well. I would definitely return to try the rest of the dishes. Overall a great experience without French fries."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Husband's birthday,1,50,29-Jan-16,The staff were very very nice to have held our table. We had to revise our reservation from 7.30pm to 8pm and we were late because we had taken the bus to the wrong outlet. Staff were accommodating and v helpful. And we enjoyed our steak a lot. Will definitely recommend and return. 
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good Service!,1,50,21-Jan-16,The environment around is awesome! Recommended! Good service with very polite staff! I would go again!
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good food, service average",1,40,6-Jan-16,"Great ambience because we had a table outdoor with a great view of the river. Food was great. Service was average as one of the waitresses seemed to have little knowledge of what's on the menu, hence unable to answer some of our questions."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good food, good service with good wine selection!",1,40,2-Jan-16,Good but not great! The second time we went to the restaurant the Os A Moelle ( Beef Bone Marrow With Toast ) was served warm (not hot) and uncooked inside. We loved the Grilled Lamb Couscous. A good place with great ambiance for couples.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great Resturant for a Steak,1,40,21-Dec-15,"Have visited this restaurant many times.Our meal was very good and the service was of a good standard. The restaurant is very close to the river and you can choose between inside and outside.If you are after a good quality steak in Singapore, look no further."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best value steak in town,1,50,18-Dec-15,"There are cheaper steaks, and there are better steaks for a lot more money. But in terms of best value for money for a mouthwatering steak, you can't go past Les Bouchons. With free flow fries, dinner rolls and a side salad, you don't need to even order an appetiser. Best choice, go with the extra-tender Beef Filet with the Blue Cheese sauce."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Amazing steak!,1,40,15-Dec-15,"Ribeye steak medium rare was perfectly grilled. Portion is big. Well grilled, every bite has got flavour, meat was tender with good marbling of fat at the side.
Fries were home made and cut in-house, very tasty too."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Cote de boeuf,1,40,12-Dec-15,"Les Bouchons is always my choice of restaurant for good steak. This time I ordered the cote de boeuf for 3 pax (2 adult and 1 child) sharing. When the steak arrived, it was near perfect. As usual, the meat is tender and juicy, well grilled to medium to our delight. However, the meat around the bone is rare. Maybe, the next time I will request the bone to be well cook so I can bite on it. My kid feels that the fries should be crispier and that will be perfect."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent steaks.. Excellent price.. Great ambiance,1,50,10-Dec-15,"Fantastic.. Will definitely come again
Reservation was handled properly
Service was impeccable and the food was excellent.. Vigneron steak a definite recommendation"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Delicious steaks,1,50,3-Dec-15,We had a lovely meal with friends & family the steaks were full of flavour & cooked to perfection! A great atmosphere with a great view & efficient staff.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,My favorite place in Singapore,1,50,30-Nov-15,"I use to spend some days in Singapore 2 times per year. The first evening when I need to resource myself, I'm going in this very pleasant place. I take a a huge surloin steak with home made frenc fries.When I'm living, I'm full and relax."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Amazing food. Not so good service,1,40,28-Nov-15,"Although we waited for the table, the steaks were absolutely perfect.
The staff is far from perfect, but in the end is more than worth the visit"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent couscous royal,1,40,28-Nov-15,"Went to Les Bouchons chiefly for its couscous royal n it turned out to be excellent. Meat is tender n merguez is very tasty. Brought us back to Quartier Latin in Paris, while we're just here in Singapore! Only missing some French musics to suit the ambiance"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Great steak, good service",1,40,21-Nov-15,"Quality of their steak is fantastic, though accompanied by a huge quantity of fries and over-vinegared salad. The chicken served with the Couscous Royale was dry but the rest of it was great."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,La Bouchons,1,40,12-Nov-15,"Good job
Good service
Good day
Good mates
Nice air
Nice toilet
Nice food
When why must write so much chop?"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great experience,1,50,31-Oct-15,Food took a while to come even though we were one of the earliest there. Other than that it was a lovely evening. Food tasted great and the service was just nice.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Steak and fries - don't miss their Beaujolais Nouveau party,1,40,17-Oct-15,"Well-priced French steak and frites, Les Bouchons also throws the best Beaujolais Nouveau party on the river!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Drinks near the river,1,40,18-Sep-15,"We sat outside on tables right on the rive front, very nice environment for a relax, people watch and quite for conversation to easily be heard."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Bon Appetite!,1,50,16-Aug-15,"We made reservations through Chope and I highly recommend it. We had originally put in a request for indoor seating but all requests are not guaranteed. When we arrived, we were told that our reservation came in after all indoor tables were booked. Looking around I could see why. The inside of the restaurant was tiny. They were wonderful at finding us a seat outside and although it was a particularly hot night, they had fans outside which kept us comfortable. Turns out that it was more enjoyable sitting outside by the bustling River. I'll make outdoor reservations next time. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. We had a wonderful evening and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. I look forward to our next visit and will be using Chope reservations again."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Nice Ambient and Food,1,40,29-Jul-15,"The steaks were not bad. Could improve on the fries though (they went cold pretty quickly).
Has a good selection of wine to go with your steak."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great French food complemented by excellent service,1,40,5-Jul-15,"We were craving the famous steak frites and were excited to find Les Bouchons. The welcome was efficient, but not overly warm. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations. The food was faultless and the portions were ample, so we were not able to take advantage of the offer of bottomless chips...and the chips are fantastic. Our only slight gripe is that they close after lunch at 2PM. We will definitely be back."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak and refill fries...!,1,50,2-Apr-15,"Situated on th Singapore river, great steak and the wines not bad too, although the wine is S$12.50 a glass (£6) , rib eye steak £17 ish. You can ay £25 for entrecôte. Had a lovely night, staff are friendly and helpful."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,An old friend...better than ever,1,40,25-Mar-15,"Used to go to the Ann Siang restaurant every Saturday without fail when we lived in Singapore, but always found the Rive Gauche restaurant (despite the setting) a step or two off the pace. However, was back in town last week with my son (14), and we visited the riverside version Saturday night along with a friend. It may have helped that the excellent Ann Siang manager happened to be at the riverside version for a week (and recognized us from a few years ago), but our food was absolutely outstanding, as was the whole evening. Usual starters included smoked salmon and terrine de maison, but it was the filets that killed it...absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked. Desserts were completely unnecessary...so we had them anyway. Only reason it's not 5* is the prices these days..and even that's a little unfair since it's the same story all over Singapore. Absolutely terrific."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Nice ambience, polite and friendly staff",1,50,10-Mar-15,"went on a weekday, it was a nice and quiet place for a romantic dinner with my so. had the signature steak and fries and it was fantastic! service staff were polite and friendly. would wanna visit this place again!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great atmosphere,1,40,26-Jan-15,"Great location just by the river, had steak with fries (free flow but did not ask for seconds as it is a lot.). Was served bread as a starter accompanied by salad. Salad was good however the bread is disappointing as it is cold and hard, making it hard to chew. The steak however was amazing. Kudos to the steak. Service is prompt and attentive. Overall was a great experience despite the rock-hard bread."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Great steak and chips,1,40,16-Nov-14,"We ate here on our second night in Singapore prior to flying out to Lombok the next day. Having spent a long day walking several miles with a few liquid refreshment stops, we were in need of a hearty meal and opted for Les Bouchons in Robertson Quay. The steak was very good with plenty of chips and a pleasant half carafe of red wine. Unsurprisingly it was quite expensive but par for the course in Singapore considering the location."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Beers and steak - bring it on!!,1,40,29-May-14,Had the chance to go for a team dinner during a working trip. Was staying at the Gallery hotel and this restaurants is right there at Robertson Quay. Brilliant ambiance to begin with. Excellent food - recommend the steak for sure. Look forward to going back for another round soon.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,If you are up for a Steak go!,1,40,19-May-14,"French style and taste, steaks of the fine art, great fries, sitting inside cool or outside a bit warmer, hip environment, wonderful appetizers, you name it. Add friendly service, pay for the value you get and you will leave the place feeling good and satisfied. I went there with friends and we just enjoyed it!"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,excellent,1,40,14-May-14,"delicious meat with the vigneron butter, french fries excellent, large choice of famous wine...
staff members so friendly"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Actually very good,1,40,15-Jan-14,Good ol steak frites much like you would expect in a good cafe in a major European city. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Make sure you sit outside if possible as the inside has exactly zero atmosphere. Dont both with the beef from Normandy just get the regular sirloin with fries and a side you like and off you go. Enjoy.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Arguably the best Filet Steak...""",1,50,10-Dec-13,"One of the best, if not THE best filet steak I have had the pleasure of devouring anywhere in the world! And the never ending supply of beautifully cooked chips was very welcome, as they were so good also. A favourite restaurant of my Son who eats there regularly and I could really understand why on this evening's evidence. Yes, I can agree that there is little to commend the restaurant interior. If atmosphere is your priority then Les Bouchons is probably not for you but if you are looking for, possibly, the best steak in Singapore then you have to try Les Bouchons Rive Gauche (if you'll pardon my french!)."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Fantastic Chips,1,40,13-Nov-13,"Came here with my family and although it was a bit pricey the food was very good. The steak was tender and had lots of flavours, but definitely come for the chips. They were very crunchy, like they were deep fried three times, and they have unlimited friesIf your in Singapore, and your in need of something french or something else besides Asian, come to Les bouchons, and you also get a great view"
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Always a sure thing,1,40,26-Oct-13,"Been going very regularly at Les Bouchons, every time I crave for a simple but very efficient meal. The ""steak frites"" is just excellent. Served perfectly grilled, withe a nut of butter atop. The french fries are home made, not these frozen stuff served in most restaurants. Sauces are the immortal mayonnaise and béarnaise. As a starter they serve you a well balanced green salad with wholenuts. They could do a little bit better with the wine per glass's quality. Nice terrace which brings the perfect atmosphere to share a simple dinner, at a very reasonable price, with some friends. An excellent ratio quality/price which never deceive."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Fries with your Filet?,1,40,25-Sep-13,"Not sure why so many Singapore restaurants are focused on serving French fries, albeit they are ""French"".... I had the Filet which was excellent, and the only other thing on my plate was a huge pile of fries, which just did not seem appropriate."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Excellent steak house,1,50,12-Aug-13,"I have tried many steak houses in singapore but this one is definitely my favorite.The meat is delicious and so are the fries (if you like them overfried)and all of this at a reareasonable price for singaporeTheir outdoor tables have a nice atmosphere, but it's very bland inside so get an outside table."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good service, great steaks (and chips)",1,40,3-Aug-13,"Overlooking the upper reaches of the river on Robertson Quay this restaurant offers good value for simple food, well-prepared. Three of us had steak and chips, one had lamb and sausage kebabs and chips. With a bottle of wine and other drinks the bill as 75$S each, or about 38GBP."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Good honest steak in a relaxing setting,1,40,18-Apr-13,"I have been here before, but stopped by again last night for a steak, together with a client. We took a table outside, to soak in the atmosphere of the Singapore river. The menu is short, but the food is well executed and geared towards steaks. I had a rib eye steak and my colleague had lamb skewers, both of which came with a mixed salad served beforehand. I ordered my steak rare, and it came just as ordered. We were debating whether to have a starter, but I am glad we didn't because the portions are generous. Fries came as ""free-flow"", which is a bit of a gimmick, because I don't know anyone who has actually finished the first portion! The wine list contains a selection of good wines under S$100 a bottle. Dinner for two with a bottle of good red wine was just under Sin$200, which in Singapore is pretty reasonable value for what you get.I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good, honest steak in a relaxing setting."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Good steaks, attentive service, quite expensive",1,40,12-Apr-13,"After three days of mostly asian food, a colleague and I decided we wanted red meat. This restaurant has quite a small interior but plenty of space outside.Staff were attentive, steaks were fine. My rib eye was a bit too fatty so a fair amount of waste. My colleague had an entrecote which didn't look like it had been rested properly because there was plenty of blood on the plate by the time he was done. But he seemed happy enough.The bottle of wine we had was fine but expensive. Overall, fine, but not outstanding given their prices."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Brilliant Steak and Chips,1,40,2-Feb-13,"This place is located under Singapore Tyler Print Institute and was a real surprise. I was really satisfied by the size of the steaks (300g) and the chips (free flow) were excellent. Nice location on the river, but they need to look at reducing their corkage. $30 a bottle and the cheapest wine on the menu is a average drop. We sat outside and the fans were just right."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Huge portions, great service!",1,50,4-Oct-12,"Me and my husband visited the restaurant whilst on honeymoon. We'd just arrived in Singapore and we came across the restaurant on a walk by the river. The waitress quickly organised a table for us, gave us menus and took our drinks order. The menu does not offer a huge list of choice but the 'steaks and fries' dishes that are available, left me with a tough decision, they all sounded delicious! we ordered starters which were lovely but when the main courses arrived I wished we'd not had them as the portion was huge. The rib eye steak although about the same price you'd expect to pay in the uk was twice the size and perfectly cooked to my request of medium rare. Then the fries... I don't know how they cooked them but they were the best fries I've ever had! A whole mountain of them and they were 'free flowing' ...the waitress actually asked if I wanted more! All in all we left very satisfied, the perfect start to our 3 night visit to Singapore. The staff made sure our glasses were topped up all night and were very polite and friendly. The only negative I will mention is that the tables are very close together so its not somewhere to dine if you want privacy but other than that I would recommend it to anyone in Singapore."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Sense of real simple French food!,1,50,24-Sep-12,"A wonderful setting, a simple but effective menu... Don't expect what they are not selling. It's not a romantic fine dining place. It's a great place to have fun with friends or with your family! Everything on the menu is as it should be done! Go on weekends and enjoy their couscous! Go any other day and you won't be disappointed! An address to keep in mind! "
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Too much of a good thing!,1,40,17-Sep-12,Had a dinner for 5 on Satrurday night.Service was professional and attentive and the food was very good.I had the Escargots followed by a half share of a cote de boeuf. All very good and priced highly but reasonably. None of my fellow diners had any complaints with their respective dishes.Tips - be careful with you appetizer size and the amount of bread you eat. Leave room for your main course!ProsAwesome french bread and authentic butter (a rarity in Singapore)Very good serviceFree flow chipsConsFree flow chips (don't overeat!!)Portion sizes are very large
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Best French style Entrecote in Singapore,1,40,15-Sep-12,"Set in a French style Brasserie along Singapore river, a restaurant that offers very high quality meat dishes prepared to perfection.
Service is professional and very pleasant
Wine list offers good value wines."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,cosy bristro,1,40,24-May-12,"Was invited there for lunch and the place was cosy with an authentic french atmosphere, the escargot was delicious and the Rib Eye steak was done perfectly to our request, the a bottle of Chateau De Malleret and steak compliment one another."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Was much better 3-4 years ago,1,40,13-May-12,"Brought my family of six there for dinner during mother's day. My wife and I have been patronizing this place once every 3-6 months for the past 4 years. They still serve their bread and frites free flow till this day.The steak is inconsistent, there're days when it's great, and there're days where it doesnt taste as good. The ribeye is fairly consistent and great, while the frites were sometimes just nice, or too burnt. Probably the most disappointing was when they started cutting costs and using 'peh-cai', chinese cabbage to substitute in their complimentary salad. Discerning customers like myself do notice such things. But all in all, still pretty decent value for money if you need a good steak with lots of carbs."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Warm welcome, good food",1,50,18-Mar-12,"For simple bistro food, notably steaks (a wide range), prawns, frites, vegetables, salads and desserts, this could be a welcome change after an excess of fish-head curry, pepper crab, noodles and beer. Set in the quiet of Robertson Quay, just a few minutes' walk from the bustle of Clarke Quay, it offers an elegant ambiance and well-cooked plain food. There is an excellent wine list, including a wide selection of mainly French reds and whites and with big-name champagne at remarkably modest prices for Singapore. There is a terrace overlooking the river as well as the air-conditioned interior. Service for our visit was impeccable, with owner Sam providing welcome advice on the different cuts of steak and the wine list."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Better than some reviewers would have us believe,1,40,9-Feb-12,"The key to enjoying this restaurant is to understand what they do well and what they don't. Food-wise, this is a great place to go for steak frites, which they do exceptionally well. My friend and I both had a nice big ribeye steak with a pile of frites and some creamed spinach. The location is great, almost like the ""Rive Gauche"" it takes after in Paris. Most people sit on the terrace outdoors, overlooking the Singapore ""river"" on Robertson Quay. There is an indoor section, if you feel the need for aircon. The wine list is also ok, with one or two nice bordeaux, but we also had a burgundy, which was not so good. That was the good news. The bad news is that the menu is very limited, so if you don't want a steak frites, then you are going to struggle. They could also do with a couple more side dishes. At the moment, there is a choice of creamed spinach, or er... creamed spinach. Some sugar peas or carrots would not go amiss. Service was ok, although could have been a bit more attentive.So, if you want a great steak frites (steak and chips) with a bottle of wine in a picturesque setting, then this is the spot. But if you want more of the general french restaurant experience, then go somewhere else."
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,"Fantastic Steaks,Fries and Wines",1,50,23-Dec-11,Best steak in Singapore. Love the ambiance. Always a treat to visit.
French,Les_Bouchons_Robertson_Quay,Simple and tasty,1,40,28-Jan-11,"You come here for one thing, a good steak and fries (even though i tried the couscous on the weekend once and was amazed by the quality of it, probably one of the best served that far from Magreb). Wine list is good, not great value but you're in Singapore... You will have to fork out 80-100$ to get something decent.Meat is good, fries home made. Nothing spectacular and yet one the best (western) restaurant on Robertston Quay."
French,Saveur,Enjoyable meal,1,40,13-Oct-18,The place serves tasty food. Their foie gras is melty and delicious. The only complaint is the music is loud.
French,Saveur,Consistent good food & friendly service,1,40,2-Sep-18,"Sunday lunch at Saveur, and it is not crowded. Service staff could improve by proactively check on customer, if ready to order. Overall, still a satisfying experience."
French,Saveur,Simple and modern ,1,40,14-Jul-18,"This is simple and modern French eatery located at the ground floor of The Cathay building.We had escargot, French onion soup, salad, chicken penne and duck burger. The presentation was good. The portion was good and the taste of the food was quite good. Overall, good value for money."
French,Saveur,"Great service, staff and food",1,50,29-Jun-18,"Had the 3 course dinner on 29 June, and I wasn't super excited about the dessert for the set menu. That's when I noticed they serve creme brulee for 3 course lunch. So I enquired if I could change my dessert to creme brulee. The very nice and polite waiter went through the trouble of checking with the chef, instead of outrightly rejecting my request. I was pleasantly delighted that they changed the dessert for me. Although it may not seem much to some people, it's usually these little gestures that make the difference, and make people remember you. This definitely made my day, ending it on a sweet note. So, thanks for that Saveur @ Cathay!"
French,Saveur,Delicious food and good service.,1,50,24-Jun-18,We have been to Saveur many times and have enjoyed every meal. Our particular favorite dishes are the Duck confit and the various truffled foods. Easy restaurant to enjoy a nice meal.
French,Saveur,Nice french food,1,40,21-Jun-18,Ordered the set lunch. Duck confit is good as usual. Do hope they include more dish options for the set lunch/dinner!
French,Saveur,Saveur sans douleur ,1,40,16-Apr-18,"Very good food for a fraction of the price at expat-run restaurants (and we’re not talking about the top ones!) Chili crab squid ink pasta is delicious and innovative. Don’t know how they do it, as rent is not low and they use expensive ingredients from Huber’s Butchers. OK, ambience and service are not as sophisticated as Odette’s or Robuchon’s, but you come here mainly for the food lah!"
French,Saveur,Good Set lunch and friendly staff ,1,40,18-Mar-18,"This place never fails to deliver good quality food and at affordable prices. This time i ordered the set lunch. Selecting salad , seabass , sencha tea. Adding on a starter portion of pasta which i read rave reviews about it... the starter pasta was quite large for me! The salad was of normal size! I was expecting a small handful of salad .. overall was so worth the price tag. And the staff members accomodating and friendly . "
French,Saveur,Simple goodness,1,40,24-Feb-18,Their signature duck confit and creme brulee dessert were just right. Simple decor and location made for a nice ambience for an afternoon with friends :)
French,Saveur,Valentine Date,1,50,17-Feb-18,Food was great and their duck confit is a must order. However the staff seems rather short handed and multiple request from customers can overwhelm their workflow.
French,Saveur,Great location,1,40,10-Feb-18,Great location - in the heart of Singapore. Had the Duck Confit and signature pasta. Food was delicious and service was good. Good to go early as the crowd starts coming in around 6.30pm.
French,Saveur,"Consistent food, inexpensive except for desserts",1,40,9-Feb-18,"Duck confit, chilli crab squid ink pasta and sea bass great as always, but the prawn pasta was alright. Food took a long time to arrive and drinks served very late."
French,Saveur,Value for money,1,50,9-Feb-18,"The prices of the food were reasonable, came in decent portions. Had the tiger prawn aglio olio and chillo crab pasta, both were delicious."
French,Saveur,Duck confit was still as good as before,1,40,6-Feb-18,"Been some years since I dined at Saveur. Went back specifically for the duck confit. It's of the right texture & crispness, yet not oily to taste. Certainly a place to visit for wallet-friendly quality duck confit."
French,Saveur,Saveur is good as always!,1,50,4-Feb-18,"Outlet is now just called Saveur at Cathay. Food is good as usual, though the ambience feels different compared to the other saveur outlets. This Cathay outlet feels abit more industrial/unpolished."
French,Saveur,Dinner,1,40,1-Feb-18,The dinner was ok ok. Had the chilli crab pasta and it was spicy. Overall good meal since we could use the entertainer app.
French,Saveur,"Nice food, atmosphere so so",1,40,30-Jan-18,"We had the Foie Gras for starters, which was very nice. Unfortunately, though it was not late yet, they had already run out of Duck, which we had wanted to try. The pepper steak was a bit small, but nicely done."
French,Saveur,Saveur,1,40,22-Jan-18,"The crab pasta is ?????? recommended to try it
All thanks to entaintainer app. So the overall bill is more worth it ??"
French,Saveur,Nice duck confit!,1,40,19-Jan-18,"I tried the duck confit, which was the signature dish. The meat is soft and tender, and the sauce is nice. Comes with a generous serving of delish mash potato. Worth a try!"
French,Saveur,Good food but pricey,1,40,15-Jan-18,"Food is good. However, the pricr is considered high for the portion received. Place is comfortable for gathering and chit chat."
French,Saveur,Very good duck confit,1,40,8-Jan-18,"Enjoyed their duck confit, still as good since I first tried it a few years back. Pork belly is crispy on the outside, meat and fats spreaded out proportionately. Another dish to try is the Angel's hair starter. Highly recommended for friends and families!"
French,Saveur,"Great food, but small portions",1,40,5-Jan-18,"Had a gathering here with friends. It was unanimous that the food was fantastic, especially at its price range. However portions were not big enough to be fully satisfying."
French,Saveur,Centrally located Good Value-for-Money food,1,40,13-Dec-17,"Good menu choicen of starters & mains... need to add a few more choices for desserts though but what is lacking in choices in this department is made up for by the beautifully tasting Caramel lava cake. The duck confit, pork belly & the squid...More"
French,Saveur,Always Good!,1,50,10-Dec-17,"Celebrated my friend’s birthday at the restaurant! Service was good, so do the food too! Will come back again (:"

French,Saveur,Good value for money,1,40,15-Oct-17,Food quality is good and the set menu is really value for money. Serving is generous (my friends and I were actually full from the appetisers). Service is decent. Good place for a gathering with friends.
French,Saveur,Centrally located Good Value-for-Money food,1,40,13-Dec-17,"Good menu choicen of starters & mains... need to add a few more choices for desserts though but what is lacking in choices in this department is made up for by the beautifully tasting Caramel lava cake. The duck confit, pork belly & the squid ink crab pasta are all very nicely done. "
French,Saveur,Always Good!,1,50,10-Dec-17,"Celebrated my friend’s birthday at the restaurant! Service was good, so do the food too! Will come back again (:"
French,Saveur,Yummy food at affordable prices,1,40,5-Dec-17,"I dined here with my friends on a saturday night and it was pretty packed, resulting in a relatively slow service. Our food took more than 30 minutes to arrive. - The salmon confit came in a awfully small portion but I guess you're paying for its quality! The texture of the salmon was amazingly soft and tender, melting in my mouth with every precious bite I took. The lemon vinaigrette that came with it had a sweet and sour taste, which paired really well with the salmon! The only downside was that the portion was way too meagre - perhaps they could make this a main dish instead of an appetiser, upsizing the salmon and adding a side to compliment it. - The duck confit, considering that it was a signature item on their menu, was perfectly executed. The duck meat was fork-tender and delicate, with the right amount of juiciness. It is served on a fluffy bed of mashed potato purée, sautéed mushrooms and orange segments. - The pork belly was served atop a substantial amount of ""Gabure"" french stew, with coco beans, mixed frozen vegetables, sous vide egg, and drenched in honey mustard sauce. The meat wasn't particularly memorable; it could do better with crispier skin. The french stew was average-tasting as well, and it got quite 'jelat' towards the end. - Truffle fries were served hot and crispy, but there was no distinct taste of truffle at all. The parmesan cheese shavings added a nice touch to the fries, but there was no dip to enjoy my fries with. I personally felt that this dish was rather disappointing. All in all, the food served here at Saveur is certainly above average and value for money, considering their affordable prices. If you wish to satisfy your french cuisine craving without burning a hole in your pocket, this might be a place you wanna consider dining at! :-) "
French,Saveur,Food was better than the Far East and Purvis outlet,1,50,4-Dec-17,"They took some time to find my reservation from Chope, but it was understandable as we were still very early for dinner. The staff took our orders promptly and served us drinks (though payable) which were always refilled even when half-full. Food came all at once, which was abit uncomfortable - we had to eat the duck confit first otherwise it turned cold and leave the salads aside first. However, the chilli crab pasta and duck confit was really really good. It was our first time to the Cathay outlet, and I feel it fares the best out of the other 2 places we went (Far East and Purvis). The other downside was that the staff were crowding next to our table most of the time (while they wait for new customers etc), which is why ambience only 3 out of 5. Would still love to come back again, just in a different seat!"

French,Saveur,French Food Birthday Dinner,1,40,9-Oct-17,"The other reviewers were spot on. The food was delicious. Definitely try the foie gras and salmon confit. I can't speak to the authenticity of the food as I have no point of comparison, but what we did have was hearty, tasty food that left us full and satisfied."
French,Saveur,Great food & great value,1,50,5-Oct-17,"Their duck confit & saveur pasta was on point. Serving sizes were very reasonable for the prices charged.
While the interior may not look as posh, fancy or inviting as the Far East branch, their food is as good if not better."
French,Saveur,Good service and ambience,1,50,22-Sep-17,"Staff were very friendly. Took the 3-course dinner set. Appetizer and dessert was very good and worth the value. Main course sadly was a disappointment. Still, price paid was affordable for the location."
French,Saveur,Good service and value,1,40,18-Sep-17,Service was prompt and attentive. Food was tasty (as always) and good value for money considering the location.
French,Saveur,Cheap French cuisines! Worth every penny ,1,50,18-Sep-17,Around 15 douby gaut mrt! It's hard to get cheap French cusine in Singapore! Love the duck confit and potato mash.. service staff was fast too.. lovely place will definitely come again.
French,Saveur,Quality Italian food at wallet-friendly prices!,1,40,11-Sep-17,Saveur serves really quality Italian food at prices that are easy on the wallet. Must tries are definitely the Original Saveur Pasta (just $4.90 only ??) and the Signature Duck Confit!
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur (The Cathay),1,50,10-Sep-17,Food and ambience was good especially the foie gras and the pistschio pannacotta desert. Pork belly not so good but will try other food then next round. Service staff were nice. Thank you very much will definitely come back again.
French,Saveur,Good Experience,1,50,10-Sep-17,"First time dining at Saveur with a big group. We got a mix of the dinner set and ala carte. Each course came almost together, including the main course. Service staff was attentive to us, as they noticed that we had a missing utensil without us informing them for one. The food was really good in general, except that one of the dessert was not available that might. The salted caramel lava cake wasn't as delicious as we hoped, but the panna cotta was really good. Definitely recomend the duck confit and sea bass there. The salmon confit for appetizer is really good too, definitely a try for those who like sashimi. Truffle fries was a little too salty to enjoy the truffle taste well. Overall good experience!"
French,Saveur,Affordable French Cuisine,1,40,3-Sep-17,"The food here is surprisingly good. We tried the set dinner which came with starter, main course and dessert. We love the starters - the onion soup and duck salad. And the finale-
salted caramel lava cake and pistachio panna cotta. Attentive Service staff too."
French,Saveur,First date,1,50,3-Sep-17,Went to Saveur at Cathay for my first date. Had to say the food was really good and value for money. Ordered the set lunch which was only at 22.90. Had the appetizer pasta(forgot what it was called) which was really good. Main was saveur's signature confit duck which was really well done too. Only qualms was with regards to the portion of the dessert which could have been a little bigger in portion. But overall was really satisfied with the food. 
French,Saveur,Wonderful,1,40,30-Aug-17,It was a delightful dinner at Concerto by Saveur on National Day! Food and ambience was just right!!!
French,Saveur,Food small portion,1,40,29-Aug-17,"Business not very brisk, service was okay, food are fairly priced though comes in very small portions."
French,Saveur,Saveur,1,40,28-Aug-17,"Was there with my friend but the service was bad. The waiter/waitress served our order late, sort of like mixed up our order with the table beside us and I was fuming mad for the long wait. Should have more staff when the place is packed!"
French,Saveur,"Overall satisfied, however prefer Far East outlet",1,40,28-Aug-17,"Taste not as good. Service is ok, however for Chope reservation/discount, the crew have to consult the manager, perhaps should train all to be familiarize with the system. More effective! Better customer service can be archive"
French,Saveur,Lovely lunch!,1,40,16-Aug-17,"I made a reservation for the earliest Saturday slot days ago but I didn't have to as many seats were available and not many diners at that time.I ordered their new herb chicken dish and it was super! Delightful flavour! Also had their signature pasta which was not bad either.I was however, disappointed that they no longer have a pasta heavy menu... ;( wanted to try more after my first visit years ago.."
French,Saveur,Great!,1,50,13-Aug-17,"Food is good, service is good too. Had a great dinner with friends there. Reservation process was easy and were allowed to sit down first and wait for others to arrive. Food was served quickly and the staff were helpful when we want condiments or a refill of water. "
French,Saveur,"Helpful staff, affordable menu, good food",1,40,9-Aug-17,"We were attracted by the affordable rates of the set menu and were forewarned by online reviews of the tiny portions only to be pleasantly surprised. The starters like the onion soup was a hearty portion, and the duck confit was substantial and tasty. It is already known as casual french cuisine so we weren't expecting to be wowed by the food and were satisfied with what we got. We met with a terrible mishap when one amongst us got her clothes stained by red wine and the staff at the restaurant had promptly come to our rescue and even offered us a glass of white wine (and further advice) to help with the removal of the stain. We are still so grateful for the assistance. Thank you!"
French,Saveur,"nice food, reasonable price",1,40,25-Jul-17,"prices are quite reasonable and the food is pretty good
had the chilli crab pasta and the mushroom soup."
French,Saveur,Value for money,1,40,15-Jul-17,"Authentic French food can be pricey in Singapore, which makes this place an absolute gem. The Duck Confit was delicious and very good value for money for the price"
French,Saveur,Long-awaited meet-up with friends,1,50,9-Jul-17,"I chose saveur as the perfect venue for a dinner gathering with a group of friends so we can meet up after not seeing one another so often. It's my second time to the restaurant. One of the reasons why I like coming to saveur, is the sense of home feeling. I love how beautiful the ambience, design and decor is, very unique to each individual restaurant. Pricing is also made affordable. Knowing how crowded it can get on Fridays and weekends, I'm glad I still choose to reserve a table for my guests and I through the Chope app. It's helped me in so many ways. In saveur whenever I show my booking code, they already knew we were being expected there. With chope, I can always feel at home and at rest, and a feeling of closeness. Thanks to the saveur team for hosting us. will dine again at your restaurants soon. Date of visit - 7 July 2017"
French,Saveur,Good service,1,50,9-Jul-17,Basically the food here was not bad first time experience to me was quite good! Manage to try their signature dish duck confit and truffles fries. Both was good
French,Saveur,"Good Food, Service was a little slow",1,40,9-Jul-17,"Food was good, enjoyed my meal. however, service was a little slow. it could have also been due to the fact that it was a Friday night, and there were many customers they had to serve. overall, still quite a pleasant experience."
French,Saveur,Saveur @ The Cathay,1,50,5-Jul-17,I had a very pleasant dining experience at Saveur together with another couple. Very satisfied as they serve value for money food along with very good service and atmosphere.
French,Saveur,Quality without the hefty price tag,1,50,2-Jul-17,"Decided to do a casual belated birthday lunch with a close friend. Lunch set always a good choice at a reasonable price of $22.90. We chose the Saveurs Pasta to start and it always lived up to its tasty reputation. Had the pork belly for the main and friend had the duck confit. Both wonderful and executed well. Only disappointment was the creme brûlée which one has to top up $2 for instead of the dessert of the day (vanilla ice cream). Well it wasn't the taste or quality that bothered me. Both my friend and I preferred the creme brûlée as our desserts when our orders for appertiser, mains and desserts were taken at 12:30pm. Our nice server came back at 12:32pm to say that they only had one creme brûlée left. No. Seriously? There was hardly a crowd at 12:25pm when we sat down. And the creme brûlée was out??? Oh well. I took the lacklustre chocolate ice cream instead. Minus the creme brûlée fiasco, it was still a very enjoyable meal as always with prompt service!"
French,Saveur,Good Food,1,40,26-Jun-17,"Had the set lunch which was pretty good, especially the saveur pasta and the duck confit. Dessert was not bad too."
French,Saveur,Good service Good food,1,40,25-Jun-17,Reservation was made and confirmation call was rec'd within half an hour. Service was good and food is nice.
French,Saveur,Experience at Concetto,1,40,22-Jun-17,"Food was mediocre but portions were just nice. I felt that the caramel lava cake with vanilla iceream did not justify the $12 price tag, excluding gst and service charge. However, the starters and mains are good for better quality food with a lower price tag. I feel that the standards have dropped since the last time I went there."
French,Saveur,crowded restaurant,1,40,18-Jun-17,restaurant is crowded and the seating arrangements provided is not well thought of. Overall food is slightly above average.
French,Saveur,Good service and food. Nice ambient,1,50,17-Jun-17,Went there during Monday lunch time. Not too crowded and service is good. They serve the next dish only when we finish the current one. Food is excellent as per usual
French,Saveur,Delicious French food at affordable price,1,40,17-Jun-17,Saveur offers good French food at affordable price. Love their pasta appetiser and duck confit main dish. Worth returning again.
French,Saveur,"Excellent food, amazing service",1,50,14-Jun-17,"The chili crab pasta was delicious. We also tried the salmon confit, pork belly, and duck confit burger. They were all very good.
The staff was engaged, and attentive."
French,Saveur,value for money,1,40,28-May-17,love the duck confit and the angel hair pasta. the wide variety of desserts are also consistently good. we like the salted caramel lava cake the best
French,Saveur,Food still as good,1,40,16-May-17,"Food is was delicious but I find that the duck confit was slightly more salty than before. Other wise, the saveur pasta is still as good."
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner,1,40,7-May-17,It was a yummlicious dinner for my bestie's birthday. So glad she love the food & was so delighted. Definitely will be bck again soon.

French,Saveur,"Friendly service, good food at reasonable prices",1,50,29-Apr-17,"Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the time we were at the restaurant.

A wallet-friendly restaurant to visit if you are craving for nice French cuisine without burning a hole in your wallet. :) "
French,Saveur,"Nice food, with reasonable pricing",1,40,24-Apr-17,"Ordered duck confit, truffles fries and new addition in their menu - chilli crab squid ink pasta! the pasta was awesome, with the addictive sauce. worth a try!"
French,Saveur,Enjoyable dinner at Saveur,1,40,23-Apr-17,"We went to enjoy Saveur's 6th Anniversary promotion but was told that we need to order 1 main a la carte meal in order to qualify for it (besides having a birthday girl). We chose to have the set dinners instead & the manager graciously gave us free drinks. Service was fast & efficient though the main course, their famous duck confit, took a little longer probably due to the large number of orders.The chocolate & hazelnut dessert was really good but we were all too full to finish it."
French,Saveur,Good food at low price,1,40,5-Apr-17,"Generally their menu price is at a lower end as compared to other restaurants. However, they serve very nice food. Value of money!"
French,Saveur,Amazing Foie Gras!,1,50,1-Apr-17,"Had a great dinner at Saveur Cathay. Our favorites are always the Saveur's Pasta (was done much better this round then before), the Duck Confit and the Foie Gras"
French,Saveur,Good dining option for an affordable french fare,1,50,25-Mar-17,"Great ambience and food served. The choice of main courses are limited, however the quality of the dishes are overall quite consistent. Recommended to-go place with your date!"
French,Saveur,Okay service and quick food arrival,1,40,20-Mar-17,"The service was all right, and the foods did arrive quicker than we expected. The taste of chicken broth and mushroom were not bad, but not the pasta. However, I'm satisfied with overall service and waiting time."
French,Saveur,Excellent food and service,1,50,19-Mar-17,"Food and service is excellent.
Friendly staff.
Food is served promptly
Very reasonable pricing as well"
French,Saveur,Worth going back,1,50,16-Mar-17,"Food was good as usual, foie gras, duck confit, the salted caramel lava cake, all worth eating again. Ordered the 3-course set dinner, definitely worth the money.just that it was abit squeezy as they tried to put us in between 2 noisy tables. not sure why they dont like to open up their other space at the basement, but squeeze everyone at the top entrance level."
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathay,1,50,13-Mar-17,good experience to lunch @ Saveur on a Saturday afternoon. staff very attentive and courteous. food is really money for value.
French,Saveur,Excellent French Food at reasonable prices,1,40,13-Mar-17,"Very nice environment, convenient location with very delicious french food at reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again"
French,Saveur,Good food with decent pricing,1,50,10-Mar-17,"Together we ordered the mushroom soup, salmon confit, seabass, duck confit, pistachio panna cotta and the salted caramel lava. All didn't disappoint.
The only down point was we had to constantly ask the staff was our water to be refilled."
French,Saveur,affordable and delicious french cuisine,1,40,6-Mar-17,We have eaten here many times with friends and colleagues who are visiting because it is at a convenient location. Food and service is always reliably good and they have affordable set lunches and dinners with portions that are a good value for french cuisine in singapore.
French,Saveur,Nice Duck Confit,1,40,6-Mar-17,"Duck confit was good, recommend it. Sea bass was ok. The service was excellent as they constantly refilled our glasses and served each course immediately after we finished our food."
French,Saveur,Great Food Always!,1,40,1-Mar-17,"Saveur is one of my favourite local chain restaurant in Singapore.They are specialised in French food with pocket frendly price.Love the Saveur pasta... it is soooo yummy. The duck confit is also one of my favourite and the meat is so nicely done and tender.As for the dessert, i would recommend the PISTACHIO PANNA COTTA!!! So smooth and delicious.Pls keep up the good work."
French,Saveur,First time at Saveur,1,40,1-Mar-17,"Went there last Sunday for the first time. So had many questions how the promotion works. Was talking to the junior staff, thus she said she will check and get back to me on the questions, which was fine. Was going to order the chicken then they mentioned that the chicken and steak were sold out yesterday. Was wondering how come they didn't stock up for today as well. Luckily I am fine to order the other choices.. but was hoping to try the chicken though. Pleasant experience there. Hope to go there again soon. Thank you. "
French,Saveur,"Gd food, great service",1,40,28-Feb-17,"Had the set meal, service was gd but waited for a while for the food. Other than that, it was perfect, highly recommend!"
French,Saveur,SAVEUR @ CATHAY,1,40,27-Feb-17,Good value for money food . One of the best pork belly dish ever tasted ! Will definitely be back again !
French,Saveur,Affordable casual french food!,1,40,26-Feb-17,Affordable casual french food around town. My friends always order the duck confit (tender and flavourful) while I always order the Saveur pasta. It's meant to be an appetiser but I will order two portions as a Main
French,Saveur,Saveur-ing Dinner,1,40,25-Feb-17,Made use of their ongoing $1 pasta promo (with purchase of any mains). The duck confit with truffle mash (+$3) was really great! Tender and succulent duck leg meat on a bed of creamy mash (apparently the truffle taste was pretty mild though) served with orange slices and sauteed mushrooms. The signature saveur pasta was not too bad but not as great as I've expected. Also ordered the salted caramel lava cake for desserts which unfortunately was a disappointment. There was barely any hint of saltiness that it could be easily pulled off as a normal caramel lava cake D: 
French,Saveur,Value for money,1,50,25-Feb-17,Love the duck confit!!!!!! The dessert menu always changes but the pistachio pans cotta was good too
French,Saveur,Always so yummy,1,40,20-Feb-17,"First time at the Cathay outlet. We ordered the Saveur pasta (it is never complete if you did not order this), mushroom soup, seabass and steak frites (medium rare). ALL were super good. Highly recommend the seabass and steak. I am still drooling typing this."
French,Saveur,Good standard and meet expectation.,1,50,17-Feb-17,"I always enjoyed the Duck Confetti on their menu, which is a must try. I must say this is a decent place to go out with dates, well not to forget to mention, the affordable price tag. If only they could come up with more innovative quality dishes for a twist!"
French,Saveur,dinner for 2,1,40,16-Feb-17,"took too long to serve, waited 20 mins for dessert. service not up to standard, staff were unfriendly."
French,Saveur,Saveur is good,1,40,14-Feb-17,I love the duck confit and the salmon confit at saveur. The salted caramel lava cake is also delicious!
French,Saveur,Try the foie gras,1,50,14-Feb-17,"Whatever else you order, don't miss out on the foie gras (fatty liver). Price has gone up but it's still the good ol' melts-in-your-mouth fatty liver that complements any set meal."
French,Saveur,Good food value for money,1,40,12-Feb-17,"Good food. Value for money. Convenient location but ambience inside the restaurant could be better.
Good service. Nice music"
French,Saveur,Great plc for meetup!,1,50,28-Jan-17,Had dinner here and the duck confit and mushroom aoup was gd! Will be back again for another visit next time.
French,Saveur,Straightforward and Enjoyable,1,50,24-Jan-17,"Saveur makes French food affordable while offering great taste. The dinner sets included appetizers, main dishes and desserts, which were appealing, but we ultimately chose to order a la carte entrees and shared appetizers because of the discount from an e-voucher we used. Also, located on the first floor of The Cathay facing the street makes this restaurant easy to find. Plus, the wait staff were so friendly and helpful in answering our questions."
French,Saveur,Dinner at Saveur Cathay,1,40,16-Jan-17,"I pop by many Saturdays after a long day which ends in church opposite. In a sense the laid back atmosphere is a plus when you want good food in a hurry. Recently they started the set dinner menu which is good value for money. Today I had the foie gras with grapefruit, a generous serving and the grapefruit a nice counterpoint to a nicely seared liver. The beef short rib braised with red wine was a fairly small portion for me but melt in the mouth tender. Desert of the day was to be chocolate tart which they replaced with vanilla ice cream but where nice enough to change to a refreshing lemon vinigrette salad dotted with olives and hazelnuts which was good with the heavier meat I had chosen. All-in-all a good meal for $29++ so yes I came back again! "
French,Saveur,Lovely dinner!,1,50,9-Jan-17,Dined here a few times and food quality has always been consistent! I Will be back again! Yummy food!
French,Saveur,Good food!,1,40,9-Jan-17,"Had the lunch set of 3 items. The food portions were just nice. The pasta was well done and yummy, the duck was seasoned well."
French,Saveur,Great place for a large group meetup,1,40,6-Jan-17,"Went for dinner with a group of 7. The ambience, large floor space and comfortable seating was nice and we l had a great time. However the price of the food has sure gone up, when 5 years ago, the duck confiti used to cost $8.90 as compared to $14.90 now. Also, the place seemed understaff with only 3 service crew for 2 floors. "
French,Saveur,Cosy with no frills,1,40,27-Dec-16,Had the duck confit and pistachio panna cotta. Both were excellent albeit the small serving size. White and red wine are affordable at $9 per glass. Excellent service as well!
French,Saveur,Decent food at affordable price,1,50,26-Dec-16,"Went with a group of 6 adults and 2 kids, chose this place as it's kids friendly. They provide baby chairs and kids cutleries upon request. It would be better if they serve kids menu. Surprisingly it's a bit quiet, which my friends and myself like so that we can have proper conversation. "
French,Saveur,Value for Money French Food,1,40,25-Dec-16,"Value for Money French Food. Service is a tad slow though. They seem short handed.
But the food is good for its price.
Had the duck confit. Mash potatoes were smooth and duck was tender."
French,Saveur,Weekday Dinner,1,40,22-Dec-16,This is my 1st visit to Saveur. I enjoyed my set dinner very much. All the 3 courses are well prepared. Particularly enjoyed the foie gras appetiser and the beef short ribs. Good value for a French meal. We were pleasantly surprised to be asked if we enjoyed our meal. Good that the management valve our feedback.
French,Saveur,Good quality food at afforable prices,1,50,21-Dec-16,"Enjoyed the food, good ambiance. We had the set lunch. I had the Saveur pasta, which is very yums. For main course, the famous duck confit and for dessert, they ran out of vanilla ice cream which was in the set, but they replaced with something even better, chocolate mousse with crushed nuts. "
French,Saveur,Food is fabulous,1,40,20-Dec-16,Went on a friday evening. Quality and portion of food are excellent. Just a bit noisy on a busy evening. Overall very satisfied. Thanks Chope for the instant reservation service online.
French,Saveur,Fine dining at an affordable price,1,50,15-Dec-16,Food was very delicious! Service was alright but could be better. Would still come back for another meal!
French,Saveur,Nice experience,1,40,4-Dec-16,"We had the saveur pasta, lamb shank and duck confit. Service was good and food was served fast as well. Consistent quality"
French,Saveur,Value for money,1,40,24-Nov-16,Value for money but the service is slow. Small layout and selection is not large. Certain items are not available
French,Saveur,Nice quiet(er) date,1,40,19-Nov-16,"Had a nice date with my boyfriend, there was 50% discount off the starters. Unfortunately, they didn't give me the discount (I found out only a day later).We ordered the mushroom soup and Saveur Pasta as starters, which both were good. The Beef Short Ribs was small, but surprisingly filling. My boyfriend could not finish the steak. We topped it off with pistachio panna cotta which is good for sharing."
French,Saveur,Average food and setvice,1,40,13-Nov-16,The food is a bit salty. Waitress who served us put on a smile. When come to food serving...not a single staff ask us whose food it is. We have to swap ourselves.
French,Saveur,Good place with good food,1,50,7-Nov-16,"Food was great, service staff very friendly. Reasonable price. The outlet was easy to find. Ambience was nice."
French,Saveur,Must try!! Affordable French cuisine,1,40,6-Nov-16,"The dishes are delicious; and they are nicely presented on the plates; Price wise they are affordable; French food.
However, they serve the main dishes just we starting to eat our starters. And that's bad timing."
French,Saveur,Great experience,1,40,1-Nov-16,"Great dinning experience, will visit with other friends too,
Must make a reservation in order to secure a seat"
French,Saveur,Not a bad place for a date,1,40,31-Oct-16,The ambiance was good with trendy music going on. A little crowded but wasnt that bad. Food was excellent thou
French,Saveur,Affordable French Restaurant,1,40,18-Oct-16,"French food not necessary to cost a bomb, Saveur is a good place to enjoy decent french food at affordable prices. However, I find their set menu are very inflexible, everything cannot change! from food to drinks to whichever. What if some don't take certain kind of food and drinks?"
French,Saveur,Great French food!,1,40,9-Oct-16,Value for money for the duck confit! They revamped their menu end up I preferred the previous pork belly thou. The creme brulee was excellent too!
French,Saveur,Really great experience!,1,50,7-Oct-16,Dined here a few times and the food and service is really good! Love it and will definitely visit again!
French,Saveur,Would Have been 5 stars,1,40,5-Oct-16,"Heard about Saveur and gathered 3 friends to try the food at The Cathay outlet. Firstly there was no set lunch. To be fair, it was Monday and the menu had JUST changed. But there was set lunch available when the reservation was made. oh well. Just my luck Secondly, it seemed that 40% of the menu wasn't available- very strange. we wanted truffle fries- not available. so were the pork belly, seabass, beef short ribs, etc etcFood was good for those available dishes we ordered.was a birthday celebration for 1 of us and the staff were ok to provide a candle for 1 of the desserts. "
French,Saveur,Nice and cheap!! ,1,40,1-Oct-16,"You won't get disappointed at Saveur, good food with good price!!
Menu variety is not wide but they know what they're doing.
Somehow the set menu is not served today but they offer S$4.9 top up with salad/soup & drink for your main."
French,Saveur,Nice food,1,50,18-Sep-16,Food was nice as usual. No waiting time required as we have made the reservation earlier. Great experience.
French,Saveur,Good food at affordable price,1,50,17-Sep-16,Been twice and both times were great. Love the dinner set which is priced reasonably at $29.90++. Great quality and taste for the price!
French,Saveur,Yummy dinner,1,40,17-Sep-16,Came here with friends and recommend having the duck confit. It was a nice evening dinner where we were able to chat and chill. Food was good but music was a little loud that we had to talk over it.
French,Saveur,Great service and great food,1,40,8-Sep-16,"The staff who welcomed us did not make us feel very welcome. She had this grumpy look and started rattling what they have and not have before we could sit down. But after that, we had great service from the staff, including the one who welcomed us. I guess we arrived at the wrong moment. :) We enjoyed the food (the portion was just nice for ladies), one-for-one wine and the duck salad. The restaurant was nice and cozy. We will definitely go back again."
French,Saveur,Food taste good,1,40,5-Sep-16,"Had set dinner. The food tasted good. A little pricey but recommended for another visit.
You may or may not like their industrial interior. Open kitchen concept, so your clothes may get the food smell. Overall pleasant experience though"
French,Saveur,Saveur's Review,1,50,30-Aug-16,"The quality of the food is spot on. If you're looking for a place to have nice food and drinks, saveur's the place you might want to place it on your check list."
French,Saveur,Thumb up for the food,1,40,26-Aug-16,The restaurant have 1 for 1 wine promotion. Me and my hubby enjoyed the food as well as the wine in this kind of relaxing atmosphere. Will come back again.
French,Saveur,Nice Restaurant,1,50,17-Aug-16,Had a lunch here last Sunday. Nice food and ambient. The price is affordable for French cuisine. Enjoy my lunch here.
French,Saveur,Nice food,1,40,9-Aug-16,Food was great but portion could have been slightly more. They charged for water but was not prompted in refilling it. My Friend and I were not full after the meal.
French,Saveur,excellent food,1,50,8-Aug-16,Visit saveur multiple times. Serve good food with reasonable price. Enjoy the food. Always recommend to frenz
French,Saveur,Value,1,40,1-Aug-16,The starter and main were acceptable good but the drinks & dessert are normal. Overall is value for money.
French,Saveur,Concetto by Saveur,1,50,25-Jul-16,"Im not sure if this was the same place as I had been before (they were serving lots of pasta before). Much to my demise, I couldn't get to have pasta again. The set meal was very filling but very pricey."
French,Saveur,Brilliant food!,1,50,24-Jul-16,"Food is always consistently great, it never fails to delight my friends and guests alike. Tasty, affordable and reliable, what more can I ask for?"
French,Saveur,foie gras can be better,1,40,21-Jul-16,"1 side is slightly crisp, the other side just nice 100% cooked, no crisp at al. feels like the chef forgot abt that side. not as nice as it usually was. beef tenderloin was wonderful but the sides werent to my liking. but worth it for dinner set. the sea bass was even better i feel. the potatoes were great. however they dont give discount when i use voucher from chope when they said can, the last time i went. oh well. servers are more attentive compared to elsewhere...... "
French,Saveur,Saveur@Cathay,1,40,21-Jul-16,"It was not bad for a casual French cuisine restaurant and quite good value, especially when there is promo. Especially like the salmon confit - A Must-Try!"
French,Saveur,"Good food, not just good value",1,50,14-Jul-16,Saveur has upped their game from their early days in a coffee shop. Now it's good food and not just good value.
French,Saveur,Amazing Food always,1,40,27-Jun-16,"The food is without a question, great. Portion is also generous. But my wishlist will be that recommendations and slight enthusiasm will be great."
French,Saveur,Will come back again,1,40,22-Jun-16,"Ordered : foie gras with lentils, salmon confit, baked chicken, salmon, beef, chocolate &hazelnutFoie gras: creamy,melt in your mouth goodness, paired perfectly with lentil to bring down the oilyness. Salmon: 2.5 out of 5 stars. Barley risotto is sour and uncomfortabke, salmon skin is excessively salty. Only good part is the soft,moist pinkish salmonC&H: heaven on first 5 bites.Jalat after. Crunchy bits gives texture to this art piece dessert and the raspberries help to lessen the jalat feel. Pure sinful .yum."
French,Saveur,value for money,1,40,18-Jun-16,"food is nice and price is really cheap, butthe tables are so tiny, only can barely seat for two people…"
French,Saveur,Good service,1,50,15-Jun-16,Had a birthday celebration there and all was good. We could keep our cake there as well for quite a few hours ahead of our dining time. Service crew was courteous and food was good! Duck confit and truffle mash is the best
French,Saveur,Thumbs up,1,40,13-Jun-16,"Reservation was fast to confirm & everything was good. However, not quite sure why the restaurant that day had a very strong oily or fried smell that lingers on your clothing. Normally it wasn't like this."
French,Saveur,"Food is good, a pity no birthday special for customer visiting them on actual day of birthday.",1,40,9-Jun-16,"We love the yummy food and it's presentation. We love their desserts too. The ambience is a bit cold, lighting too dark, we visited them on a rainy day for lunch. Too dark to even take picture nicely. Maybe lighting not enough, need to call the staff a few times to get their attention. The staff are otherwise friendly and nice. We love their food but it will be a plus point if they could improve on hospitality. For customers visiting them on their birthday, it will be really nice if they could even give a slice of cake or a special drink on the house. Well, I'm just suggesting. Maybe at night the place will be more romantic with it's dark setting. My visit at Saveur on evening is more pleasant.I will visit again and look forward to an improve ambience."
French,Saveur,French made accessible,1,40,4-Jun-16,Party of 7 for Mothers' Day Lunch. They have a discount for the 2 mothers in the dining party which was a more meaningful gesture than the typical overpriced special occasion menus. Saveur stuck to their tried & true set lunch menu. The dried baby shrimp & noodle appetizer is noteworthy as is their entrée duck confit. All the other options were no less delicious. They're affordable and unpretentious. On the repeat list. 
French,Saveur,Exceeds expectations,1,50,3-Jun-16,"The food exceeded my expectations, could tell that much thought was put into cooking the food. Loved the Salmon Confit especially and the cookies and milk."
French,Saveur,Excellent customer service and slightly above average food.,1,40,1-Jun-16,"The food was not the best, but slightly above average. Duck confit's a must try! Truffle mash was really tasty.
The customer service makes up for the moderate food though, keep it up!"
French,Saveur,Set Dinner,1,40,29-May-16,We had the 3 course set dinner. We were pleased with the quality of food served and at an affordable price for french cusine.
French,Saveur,Naise,1,40,23-May-16,Food was good for the price. Service was great and the overall environment was really nice to chill :-)
French,Saveur,"Great food, Small portion",1,40,10-May-16,"go there with an open mind, portion isn't big so don't go there with a hungry tummy and expect it to be filled.. French cuisines are known for small portions. Overall we had a wonderful meal and great location before catching our movie @ The Cathay"
French,Saveur,Great food. Fast service.,1,50,9-May-16,Great food. Fast service.Except the dessert has rum marinated grapes and need to highlight esp got kids ordering .
French,Saveur,Good for family weekend brunch,1,40,5-May-16,"It's quite vacant on weekend, very nice for brunch with fam. Have been there a couple times now, always go for duck confit."
French,Saveur,try the baked chicken instead of the known duck confit dish,1,40,4-May-16,foie gras was of top standard this time. the pasta was a little plain w little tiger prawns in mini cubes. the oven baked chicken was freshly baked and the truffle mash go along w it perfectly as usual.
French,Saveur,good food and value for money,1,50,2-May-16,"recommended. food is awesome and price is value! will go back again. space is small, service is quick, menu is clear. should have some photos of food for easy selection. I have to google or search on ig for food photo to know what i'm having. "
French,Saveur,Fine dining at affordable prices,1,50,2-May-16,It was really crowded. Luckily I could reserve through Chope! Food was delicious surpassing my expectations! The deco was kept to a minimum which is a good idea to keep costs low!
French,Saveur,Simple evening in town,1,40,1-May-16,"Visited this restaurant with the GF over the Labor Day weekend. We were quite satisfied that the place was peaceful and allowed us to enjoy a lovely conversation over dinner. We ordered Saveur's Pasta for starters to share, and Chicken Roulade and Pork Belly for mains. The food was as expected: simple, affordable and definitely value for its price. Overall, we would recommend for anyone looking for a simple and unpretentious meal with their SOs."
French,Saveur,Quality not compromised by crowd,1,40,1-May-16,Went there on a busy Saturday evening. They seem to be running on minimal manpower. However the staff were polite and efficient. The quality of the food was great. It wasn't compromised at all.
French,Saveur,Good food as usual,1,40,30-Apr-16,Always a fan of the saveur pasta and duck confit. Waiting time was acceptable and service was generally good.
French,Saveur,Affordable,1,40,28-Apr-16,"Food selection was not wide. However, the prices were very affordable considering how they are situated in town. Ambiance was less than satisfactory because of the noise and crowd. However, the duck confit was a winner. The foie gras was, however, disappointing. So is the Seafood Bisque. Garden Salad and Escargots were average. The Saveur Pasta (appetizer) was delicious! "
French,Saveur,Fantastic food but lack of service,1,40,28-Apr-16,"My favourite food there is saveur pasta for my appetizer, then duck confit is for my main course. Unfortunately, the service is terrible, the hostess or staff didnt assist me or tell me where is my table, then the staff there is not friendly( they show attitude) "
French,Saveur,Great Service!,1,40,28-Apr-16,"Last week we were celebrating my friend's birthday at Saveur and we had a great time there. The foods are delicious with reasonable price. I requested to put some wording on the dessert in order to give a surprise to my friend. The staff helped me to do so and, on top of that, they lighted up a candle for us as well. Really appreciate that. We will definitely revisit the restaurant again. Thank you."
French,Saveur,Good,1,50,25-Apr-16,It is a place where good food are made affordable for people. The service is also good with the venue being accessible from dhoby ghaut mrt station.
French,Saveur,Comfortable setting,1,40,6-Apr-16,"Nice food, prompt service, comfortable ambience. Abit pricey but of coz not expensive compared to other French cuisine."
French,Saveur,Pretty great,1,40,1-Apr-16,"Service was alright, nothing to complain about. The food was great for the price. Would definitely come back again. :)"
French,Saveur,Saveur @ Cathy,1,40,11-Mar-16,Will revisit & recommend. Food is good. Pricing average. Saveur Pasta a must to try. Except no coffee...
French,Saveur,Cheap French Fine Dining Experience,1,50,8-Mar-16,"Brilliant main course. Do try their Salted Caramel Chocolate Lava cake. In all a complete value for money. Portions are small, very French indeed."
French,Saveur,-,1,50,8-Mar-16,It is value for food. The service is good. I enjoyed my dinner there. Sad thing is dinner 3 course menu doesn't include duck confit for mains otherwise would have ordered the course menu dinner
French,Saveur,Excellent Food for the Price,1,40,1-Mar-16,"Went for their Valentine's set menu and it was very good. Portions were just right and generous considering the price.Only upsetting bit was actually nothing on the restaurant's part, we were sat next to a very unpleasant group who were being very difficult customers with a whole slew of 'custom orders' that kept changing. But kudos to the staff for handling them with poise and patience! (:"
French,Saveur,Affordable quality food,1,40,29-Feb-16,First time at Saveur and I am loving it. The food served are of good quality and affordable. The 3 course meal is a good deal but only if your stomach have space for that. Do book early via Chope so you will avoid to queue. 
French,Saveur,Saveur at Cathay,1,50,11-Feb-16,"Good ambience and also food is affordable and delicious! Must try their duck confit. There's a promotion going on, order 2 mains to get a free appetizer pasta which is totally worth it!"
French,Saveur,It's great,1,50,4-Feb-16,"Great food, great service. Very cheap and tastes nice. Food took a little long to come but there was full house on that day."
French,Saveur,Not a quack when it comes to duck,1,40,29-Jan-16,My wife hv our weekly dates n it's up 2 me 2 find new n wonderful places to eat. I'm not a lover of duck but i tried. But we'll from a non lover i really loved it. Really good food
French,Saveur,"Great food, nice ambience at very affordable price",1,40,9-Jan-16,This is my first visit to Concetto although have been to Saveur several times already. The festive set meal is quite limited but we have option to order from a-la-carte menu too. This might not be possible during Christmas period in other restaurant. Overall the food is very delicious and will definitely visit again.
French,Saveur,"Food was great, staff are attentive",1,40,30-Dec-15,"Food was great, staff are attentive and fast to recommend similar food when the ones we ordered were not available. The restaurant wasn't too noisy, conducive for small gatherings with friends. Will be better if there are more choices for dessert."
French,Saveur,Affordable and satisfying,1,40,14-Oct-15,Went to have a nice dinner but there is no seat available at the moment. Reserve a table and within 10 mins received a sms notification that a table is ready. Food is nice and quite affordable. Will be back again soon
French,Saveur,Inexpensive Italian yummy foods,1,40,11-Sep-15,"I had make a reservation prior to dinner since is a Friday evening. The restaurant has a cool and young feel. I love the food and the portion is just nice for a small eater like me. I ordered the MUST TRY dish on the menu ""Duck Panzerotti"" ($14.90). The duck meat was wrap in moon shape pasta that looks like dumpling. On top of the pasta, was some sweet potato crisp. I love the salty taste dumpling but the sweet potato crisp was a bit too hard. My friend ordered the Crab Risotto ($12.90). I normally don't like t eat risotto but this was certainly good. The texture was just nice, not too creamy and very yummy. I would come back and try others dishes another day. But the service staffs was not very attentive."
French,Saveur,Sampling fine dining with low price,1,40,9-Apr-15,Went there for a Sunday brunch with friends. I find that the menu price is very affordable but what surprises me more is that the palate leans towards French-Italian fine dining style. Service was average but that's because it was very busy. I would certainly come back again to try more from its menu.
French,Saveur,"Good food, reasonably priced.",1,40,20-Dec-14,"Started by young chefs a few years out of culinary school, you can feel the energy of the place. The last time I was here, I had the beef which was good. This time, I tried the pork cheek with gnocchi, which is also good. Portions are not big but prices are reasonable. Worth going back again."
French,Saveur,Value For Money!,1,40,23-Sep-14,Good location for great food at very affordable prices. Don't judge it by the exterior.I had the spring chicken dish with cognac cream sauce which was wonderful. It is amazingly easy to screw up chicken but my dish was succulent and tasty. Also paired it with a glass of acceptable white wine for $6 which was quite value for money. The food also came SWIFTLY which was a plus point!Seating was a little tight but was not too bad. Overall a good place for dinner! Would return when in town
French,Saveur,Good food at central location,1,40,2-Sep-14,"Stumbled on this place for lunch on Saturday noon. Pleasant environment, food wise, most dishes were great. I had the squid ink risotto which was really good. The squid salad also very good. WIll give the prawn fettucine a miss next time as it turned out to be too similar to a local dish called ""mee pok"". Prices were reasonable and there's a promo for drinks when you get a main dish. Service was just ok. Will go there again only because the food is good."
French,Saveur,Risotto just the way I like it,1,40,5-Aug-14,"I've come to Concetto twice for their mushroom risotto and have yet to find a risotto elsewhere that's to my liking as much as this place. At other restaurants, risotto if not done well can turn out soggy and bland but Concetto's version is perfectly al dente (is that the right term?) and wonderfully flavorful. Portions are not full-on American sized but I find that this way it leaves room to enjoy a starter and/or dessert. The deconstructed tiramisu is pretty awesome as well - although it did take us a few moments to adjust to the idea of not having a bowl or glass.Concetto is very popular, so it would be better if you made your reservation ahead of time so that you don't have to wait. Again, due to the popularity, you will feel rather 'hounded' - not by the waitstaff who are lovely and understanding, but by the many pairs of watching eyes of those waiting to be seated."
French,Saveur,It's heavenly!,1,50,13-Jul-14,"It looks good, smells lovely and tastes heavenly! We popped in for lunch on a whim, when we had originally set out for ramen. However the tailback for the carpark at Bugis+ was atrocious so we zipped over to the Cathay instead.What a treat! The tuna pan seared was fabulous with its salad and sauces, as was the grilled octopus and bed of shredded fennel.The piece de resistance was without doubt the Wagyu Tender; done medium rare it melts in your mouth accompanied by the dulcit tones of the foie gras. The other main we had was the beef oyster blade. Very tender and beautifully seasoned and plated, it was of a standard that wouldn't be out of place in any of the other fine dining French establishments in town.Treat yourself, it's amazing! "
French,Saveur,What a treat!,1,40,26-Jun-14,I have been to this place 2nd time around and I may say the food is delicious plate by plate it comes to beautifully presented and equally good tasting.affordable treat!
French,Saveur,Birthday dinner for 17 people,1,50,27-May-14,"Amazing - even with a huge table , everything was great! The food the wine and the service! And so so reasonable priced! Thank you so much - do your self a favour and go!!!"
French,Saveur,"Small portions, reasonably priced",1,40,21-Apr-14,"The six of us tried several starters (Earth) and several mains (both Land and Seas).All of us agreed the Grilled Octopus was good, while opinions were more divided on the Caesar and Tuna.The Creamy Pork was tender and tasty, although the pasta could be better. The Beef Oyster Blade was juicy and tender, and the Salmon nicely done. We were less enthusiastic about the risotto but the Funghi and Crab were both quite good.The portions are rather small, so it's a good idea to share a few starters, but prices are very reasonable and service is quite good.The restaurant gets crowded so reservations would be a good idea."
French,Saveur,Updating my previous review,1,40,7-Apr-14,In my last review I mentioned that the service I received at Concetto in the early days of their opening was not very attentive. I still think that the food is fabulous and have yet to leave room for the great looking Tiramisu. However since I wrote my review I have learned that the owners intentionally hire front of the house staff who are new to the hospitality industry and provide them on the job training/experience. I think this is such a worthwhile effort that I wanted people to know and so I wrote this update.
French,Saveur,Good food with reasonable price,1,40,1-Apr-14,"I was there with a group of friends on a Thursday night. Reservation is a must if you do not want to waste time waiting for a table. The restaurant was full on that day.As the portion was not big, each of us ordered a main course and some sides to share.We tried the grilled octopus, crab risotto, creamy pork, duck tortellini and tiramisu (the pistachio panna cotta was already sold out at 7pm!!). We enjoyed and liked all of them.Service was prompt and good. If you like simple restaurant with good food, this is the place."
French,Saveur,Great cooking with decent prices near orchard!,1,50,20-Feb-14,"I was in Singapore recently for work and was asked to try out concetto. While it may look like the generic and very typical orchard fare, the food was far from it. The chefs hail from some of the best restaurants in the city like guy savoy, jaan and db. My brother and I tried the crab risotto, pork ravioli, mushroom risotto, and pistachio panna cotta. All for about sgd 58. The food was honest and just good cooking. A breath of fresh air."
French,L_Angelus,Memorable romantic restaurant with unexpected delightful cuisine and wine,1,40,11-Oct-18,"I have since rebooked for our next trip to Singapore- it really feels like an authentic regional restaurant in France- totally unexpected. Excellent produce used in great dishes, with great service."
French,L_Angelus,"Delicious food with a great service, I felt like a princess!",1,50,13-Jul-18,"A French restaurant in Singapore with this quality is something I’ve never seen before! It was an authentic french kitchen, like in the old days, amazing. The service was also really great! Compliments to the whole team, I enjoyed my evening! Thanks!"
French,L_Angelus,Eclectic French Cuisine ,1,50,28-Aug-18,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend. The wine selection was phenomenal. The service was impeccable. The food Was delicious. Overall, when in Singapore, I would experience it again."
French,L_Angelus,One of my favorite French restaurants!,1,40,19-Aug-18,"I have been a couple of times to this restaurant and I was happy with their food every time. Food was tasty and quite generous portion, specially cheese. There was a good selection of wine and reasonable price. Staff were polite and attentive. It was quite relaxed ambience too, one of my favorite French restaurants in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Never disappoints!,1,50,16-Aug-18,"We go for special occasions, this was our silver wedding anniversary. We were offered complimentary champagne on arrival which was very thoughtful. We both had onion soup which was absolutely stunning. My wife had seabass and I had ribeye with gratin dauphinois and pepper sauce. We both had crepes suzette which were just gorgeous, every bite was so delicious. We finished with calcados and Amaretto.. A perfect evening with great service and warm ambiance. We'll be back many more times "
French,L_Angelus,Quality French restaurant ,1,40,2-Aug-18,"If you are looking for good French food without burning a hole in the pocket, look no further. Located in the lively Club Street area, the restaurant is reminiscent of a typical quaint Paris restaurant. The quality of food was good as was the service."
French,L_Angelus,Good French bistro dinner,1,50,30-Jun-18,"Came here for my wife's birthday dinner, though we didn't tell the restaurant since she likes it low-key.We had- Mixed green salad with roquefort blue cheese and bacon- Pan-Fried Dover Sole, Butter Lemon Sauce, Steamed Potatoes- Cassoulet (Meats And Sausages, Served With Duck Confit And Pork Belly)- Hot Chocolate CakeMixed salad is good quality, though nothing spectacular. Nice Roquefort.The cassoulet is always my favourite, and it's enough to feed 2 persons (that's me). If you like baked beans, this would be for you. Doubly so if you like meats, as it as duck confit, pork belly and loads of sausages. 80% of the time it's done well, though on another occasion I felt that the meats were a bit tough.The dover sole was very good, though it never comes cheap (in any restaurant in Singapore). With the butter sauce it was fantastic.Chocolate cake nice enough, though I prefer the ""lava"" type where it oozes out instead of just being liquidy.All in all a very good meal again (though it would have been 4 stars during my second visit, per my earlier comment about the tougher meat in the cassoulet)."
French,L_Angelus,Friday nights ! ,1,50,19-May-18,"Not very often do you get Value & Authentic French food .. this place is a must try. From the wines to the food, & Desserts to the warm and happy hosts, it’s a place you will go back time and again!"
French,L_Angelus,White Asparagus ,1,50,24-Apr-18,"Walked in for a business lunch, we got a good sized table. It had the upscale ambience that was conducive to good conversation. Had the snapper which was terrific. my friend was vegetarian and got a special menu which was a good suprise at a proper French restaurant. White asparagus was a delight.Great red wine list including some verticals, though being lunch we did not imbibe. Will be back"
French,L_Angelus,Charming French restaurant on Club Street!,1,50,31-Mar-18,"What started off as a meeting place for a group of 4 couples, ended up being a fantastic evening in this charming restaurant. The entrance is quite charming but placid and doesn't quite prepare you for the interiors. As we entered, we were absolutely delighted with the warm interiors! The bar is quite close to the entrance which is presumably meant for patrons waiting to be seated, but we did see casual walk-ins as the evening progressed. We found their French wine collection to be very extensive! The posters on the walls also made the whole restaurant very warm and cosy.I think the complimentary warm bread rolls went down perfectly with the wine along with the butter that was served with it. The goat cheese salad deserves a special mention among the entree selections. In the mains, we shared the pan seared sea bass, pan fried Dover sole (both excellent!), marinated lamb racks (done to perfection as requested by one in our group), and the roasted chicken in a cream sauce was superb. One of our friends was vegetarian and they rustled up delightful plate of vegetables (see foto below).While we ordered both the creme brûlée and the Warm chocolate cake, it was really the chocolate one which was the winner! It was truly fabulous as they claim it to be."
French,L_Angelus,Best French meal in Singapore,1,50,31-Mar-18,"Went for dinner to L”Angelus and came away in love with the ambiance, service, wine and lip smacking delicious food . When you enter through the doors you feel transported to a Parisian Cafe in Paris. The decor is very warm and inviting and David who runs the place immediately makes you feel at home. I had the pate as my starter, Dover sole as my main course and their warm chocolate lava cake ( the first one in Singapore apparently) all were beyond delicious. Even the butter they serve is awesome. I would def visit as there is a reason this restaurant which is the first French restaurant in Singapore is still in business and doing so well. "
French,L_Angelus,Fabulous little French restaurant,1,40,14-Jan-18,We had dinner here on 2 of our 4 nights in Singapore. Excellent menu with just enough variety to the fixed menu (5 options for each serving) at an excellent $68 each. Entree options were excellent with a special mention to the goat cheese salad. Yummy.Tuna steaks with sesame seed coating were our favourite main though the second night they were a bit cool.Dessert was fabulous and the bread as it should be in a French restaurant was superb.All up a lovely restaurant and well worth a visit.
French,L_Angelus,Nice evening,1,50,6-Nov-17,"As we walked along Club street looking for a place to have dinner - we ended up at the porch at L'Angelus - eating a delicious french meal - instead of a nice Chinese dinner - as we had planned to do. They served us a delicious sole meuniere - (not even on the menu...) - - and the wine list was impressive.The guests at the neighbouring table were locals - and admitted they ate at the L'Angelus quite often - as one of their favourite restaurants in Singapore. We understand why...( service very friendly - and a very ""french"" interior - if that matters..)"
French,L_Angelus,Classic French Cuisiine,1,50,6-Sep-17,"An institution of Singapore
We went for the steak tartare and were not disappointed
The restaurant was quiet but is was Tuesday night
Well worth a visit when in Singapore"
French,L_Angelus,Excellent lunch menu !,1,50,18-Aug-17,"Went back to this little French place in Chinatown . They have now a lunch set quite nice for the price .36$. Got a cold cut platter , a nice steak, a creme brûlée and coffee . What else can you expect ? Superb . Great service too . "
French,L_Angelus,Good set menu,1,40,15-Jul-17,"Place to go if you are very hungry
Go for the set menu at dinner time, terrine was perfect
Good wine list and service
You can eat outside or inside"
French,L_Angelus,Impressive,1,50,18-Jun-17,"This restaurant is one with a long history on Club Street. Deservedly so. Good service. Flawless home made pate. An interesting amuse bouche, tasty! And well cooked steaks to order, both cuts explained by the waitress. Service was attentive as we'd come to expect from a previous visit or two. We started on the terrace this time to enjoy the sights of the street. Before mains we asked to move inside because a bar nearby decided to go heavy metal at 7.30pm. Despite the restaurant being near full, this was handled seamlessly. Glad we got to experience the ambience inside. Lovely. A well run, well respected restaurant. "
French,L_Angelus,The Only French Restaurant in Singapore for us!,1,50,3-Jun-17,"My daughter grew up in Switzerland near the French border and to her, there is nothing better than authentic French food. So to celebrate her graduation last night, out of all the restaurants in Singapore, L'Angelus was her choice. Never disappointing, simply great French food in a lovely fine dining atmosphere. And they now have a $68 three course menu that has a great selection. If we hadn't gone with our favorite menu items in mind we would have been tempted but we stayed with our favorites: duck liver pate, duck liver grilled and the Chicken Fricassee in a morel and truffle sauce (the recipe's on their website) which is to die for. For dessert, my daughter had her favorite hot chocolate cake with their luscious vanilla ice cream. One more thing, I'm on a low-carb diet (no sugar) and found the menu filled with possible options. But just to make sure, my waitress went to the kitchen and came back with a list of the best of all choices. An unbelievably gourmet meal which also didn't derail me off my diet? At L'Angelus, what's not to like?"
French,L_Angelus,Top French style brasserie/restaurant,1,50,25-Apr-17,"We had dinner with 5 people. The food was delicious. Could not fault anything. The foie gras was fantastic. Reasonable prices for the wines considering the import duties charged in Singapore. Only remark is that our waiter needs some more training.The Aperol Spitzer is good, very good. Highly recommend it"
French,L_Angelus,Happy Experience,1,50,14-Apr-17,"Stopped by late one evening without a reservation and, to our surprise, was given a table and served great food. We both had the set dinner in this classic French restaurant. The onion soup was just right - a bit of cheese and crouton in a very nice and very-full-of-onions broth. The tuna tataki with sesame was perfectly done and my wife's cassoulet was just delicious with enough to take some home with us. They offer a wide selection of wines and the wait staff understand how to recommend them. The creme brûlée was perfect as was the service through the meal. It's a bit pricy but that's common for Singapore. If you like classic French food we'd highly recommend L'ANGELUS."
French,L_Angelus,Absolutely Phenomenal Restaurant.,1,50,24-Mar-17,"The food in L'Angelus is absolutely phenomenal. Great restaurant with really good flower decoration from outside view. The service was excellent and the Chinese lady who is serving is the friendliest and most professional i ever seen in any Singaporean restaurant. I ordered as appetizer the Roasted Chavignol Goat Cheese and Salad on Walnut Bread Toasts and it was 'WOW'.As mains , i ordered Marinated Lamb Racks , Ratatouille and Mashed Purple Potatoes and Lamb it melts in the mouth. Really a great chef.So far , this is the best french restaurant i ever been in my life.Dinner 23.3.2017"
French,L_Angelus,Nice and quiet environement in a French traditional deco.,1,40,17-Mar-17,"Very good food for value. Traditional French plates.
The food menu is not taking you too long to read and choose so it is appreciable especially when what ever you take, you will be satisfy by the food."
French,L_Angelus,Solid french food,1,40,24-Feb-17,"Good french place on Club street, it is an institution, has been here for ages. I liked the meat selection. Great wine also, though they know how to charge."
French,L_Angelus,Fantastic French restaurant served excellent steak,1,50,16-Feb-17,"I was there with my wife to celebrate Valentine's Day. The place is wonderful, they pay attention to the detail from decoration in the restaurant and washroom, to the tableware on the table. The waiter and waitress are very friendly and served us very well. We ordered French onion soup, escargot, ribeye steak and Profiterolles glacées au chocolat. The escargot served in individual clay pot with a piece of toasted bread on top and that's my first time eating it this way and it's lovely and tastefully. We shared the French onion soup which is just right for both of us. The Rib eye steak served with layered potato gratin and they tasted wonderful. The serving is big and we were so full after the main course but we don't wish to miss the dessert. They displaced the Profiterolles glacées au chocolat nicely on the plate and we were in heaven. It tasted so good that we want another plate, may be next time because we were so full. We had a wonderful evening and we definitely will visit again. "
French,L_Angelus,Fantastic food,1,40,6-Nov-16,Had dinner here with a mix of colleagues and friends while on business trip. Food was very good as well as the wine. Service was good and friendly. The dishes were very large and may be reduced in size. We were not able to have dessert because of the size of starter and main.
French,L_Angelus,Excellent - highly recommend,1,50,25-Oct-16,"Came to this fantastic restaurant for a friends birthday party, the food was sensational, the service and ambiance was excellent, everyone had a great time, highly recommend this restaurant when in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent quality but expensive!,1,40,24-Oct-16,"We have visited L'Angelus during Singapore residence and visits over several years and have always been pleased with the ambience and quality. Noted on this occasion, on a busy Friday night night in Club Street, that it was very quiet and was surprised how high the prices were for even the house wine - significantly above other local establishments. Quality was still good and we enjoyed our meal."
French,L_Angelus,Very good and authentic French ,1,50,9-Sep-16,"I discovered this French bistro invited for business lunch . I was pleasantly surprised . The food is not only excellent but also very well done . Guess the chef must be French or at least trained in France ! Some interesting touch of originality here and there ( a nice variation on "" bavette"" with a kind of coriander lemon condiment ) but great classics like cassoulet or roasted lamb with an exceptional ratatouille ( I love ratatouille, this one was great ). Dessert are well done and elegant on the plate . Another thing I liked was the wine list , good choice with some rare bottles, mainly Bordeaux old vintages , very decent in price . Speaking of price , they have a 68$ menu , the one I had , quite decent for Singapore if you check the quality . Bravo !"
French,L_Angelus,Authentic French style bistro,1,40,6-Sep-16,"Have been dining here regularly for over 5 years. Nice "" French"" décor and atmosphere. Food and menu has improved recently. The Veal chop is huge, and very tasty. Remains traditionally French, as is the wine list. The wine list is on the expensive side. Closer to fine dining prices in a bistro environment. The restaurant manager is friendly and attentive, particularly to "" regular"" clients."
French,L_Angelus,Beautiful evening in a real French! Not so expensive,1,50,2-Sep-16,"Went to this restaurant following advice from hotel concierge . He told me it was one of the oldest French in town, a bit on the expensive side . But I was pleasantly surprised as they have a fantastic menu for a reasonable price ( around 68 $ if I am not wrong). They are celebrating 18 years in Singapore . Well, I had a very good chicken liver terrine , as good as in some high end bistro in Paris and my friend tried the snails who were to die for ! My main was a very good lamb, juicy tender rack perfectly cooked with a very very good ratatouille . My friend had the duck, a farm one, very tasty. Excellent dessert ( I had their hot chocolate cake, it's a very good one !). They gave good wines too and I understood from the manager lady they import most of them so pricing is very decent for Singapore . We got a bottle of a wine from south of France , Les Brunes , a kind of boutique wine that was superb and only 98$. Good value for money all in one . Honestly, I felt like in Paris in a very good bistro . Service is ok. Great place, good value. I recommend ."
French,L_Angelus,Still good after all these years..,1,40,19-Jun-16,I have been dining at this joint for over a decade and for some reason I still find it appealing though the price is on the high side but that's fine. So much for the recent feedbacks posted...one word cynical but then again to each his/her own.My all time favourites..foie gras...escargots...duck confit and their fish dishes. Will definitely be back always...
French,L_Angelus,Good Food & Good Service!,1,40,23-May-16,"Been a few times and its just as good as the first time I visited. Nice size portions, tasty food, good service, & nice ambiance. Perfect place for a great meal! ! Oysters are always fresh & escargots are divine! Of all the french restaurants I have been to in Singapore, I will say this is my favorite!"
French,L_Angelus,"Good food, well done",1,40,31-Mar-16,"Set up brasserie style, it's a good solid menu of traditional french favorites. Prices are a little steep, but the quality is evident from the moment you arrive. Foie Gras perfectly done, an amazing veal chop and a good solid wine list to choose from. Great cheese selection as well. Happy to recommend. "
French,L_Angelus,Truly good French restaurant,1,40,29-Mar-16,"A Singaporean friend assured us this was the best French restaurant in Singapore and after living in France for 30 years I must agree. The foie gras either as pate or pan seared is exceptional, the mains were all good and the molten chocolate cake with ice cream a treat. Particular kudos for the strawberry ice cream dessert. Lovely decor, good service. "
French,L_Angelus,"Awesome food, unpretentious plating",1,40,16-Feb-16,"Quality food comes in generous portions and unpretentious plating. The seared scallop with squid and pumkin soup were excellent; so was the delightful beef steak. The hot chocolate cake was to die for, while the plate of 10 assorted cheeses was delightful."
French,L_Angelus,Authentic French Brasserie,1,50,7-Dec-15,"Simply excellent food, Foie gras terrine and beef steak are a must try. Great wine list too. The service is impeccable, not intrusive and very professional.Located in Club Street, a very lively street at night. Highly recommend for people seeking for other flavours when in Singapore"
French,L_Angelus,Real French Brasserie,1,40,12-Nov-15,"From trying many french restaurants throughout Singapore, there are many places that try to give a french flavor to their atmosphere and menu, but L'Angelus is truly the best for a real brasserie experience -- great foie gras (in several styles), an excellent selection of both entrees and mains, plus a variety of the traditional desserts (with nice new touches). All in all a good experience for a traditional french meal at a high quality but not fine-dining level."
French,L_Angelus,A little taste of France,1,40,10-Nov-15,"Out and about with mates on Club Street, we all fancied a taste of France for dinner. With no booking, we were seated easily. Service is a little stand off-ish. The staff appear to lack confidence, though were very congenial. A little tinkering, and this could make the difference of this restaurant going from good to great. In terms of the food, it was really very good. We shared pate and escargot to start. A table of 5 and only 3 pieces of bread and 9 escargot. A little proactivity here could make a huge difference. At the time of ordering, if we were offered 10 escargot for additional cost, we would have opted in. We had to ask for additional bread, also. Despite this, I could not fault the food itself. Delicious. Steak was a popular choice at our table and each were cooked to medium-rare perfection. Of particular note, the Tartare was terrific. Assembled and prepared at the table, it was pure food theatre. Delightful.A good wine cellar in the house, we were pleased with the wines. "
French,L_Angelus,Thank god for this little gem,1,40,10-Nov-15,"It used to bother me that L'angelus hardly ever updated their menu; however, over the years I've come to appreciate that sometimes you just want a perfect elegant little bistro like L'Angelus that hardly ever changes. The foie gras is perfect, the confit of duck delicious and the wine list is very accessible. My only complaint is that the fries that come with the confit are a little soggy. Nevertheless, when I want classic relaxing French in a sophisticated setting, this place is always on my short list. "
French,L_Angelus,Exquisite and tasty French meal ,1,50,20-Sep-15,"Went with friends on two separate occasions, love foie gras so thought to give this French restaurant a try despite previous reviews. Talking to the staff, they had very recently undergone a change in the kitchen. Incoming Chef Reynaldo recommended the presse foie gras to begin with, the balance of sweetness and the savouriness was perfect. For our main, 2 of us had the Chateaubriande steak (portion was filling for 2) which was served with the very tasty potato gratin is a must try, codfish with cream sauce, sea bass was very fresh and tasty. For desert, we had the dark chocolate lava cake and poached pear. Dark chocolate is good, poached pear had a creamy center which is a pleasant surprise. Overall, you will not be disappointed. Ask the friendly staff and manager jasmine for recommendations and they are always willing to help.Regarding the the lack of pictures, we finished the dishes so quickly cause they were so tasty. When we remembered, only dessert was left. Will definitely be back. "
French,L_Angelus,One of these very good traditional French restaurants,1,50,14-Sep-15,"I haven't been here for years. And what a pleasure to be back. Never mind the restaurant did not upgrade its interior, as that is part of the charm.Excellent service! Seating is comfortable with even a possibility to eat on the veranda or outside on the street (when the road is closed off)Very good choice from a menu which stretches the entire variety of the traditional French kitchen. Portions are generous, which forced me to let go the very good looking choice of cheese."
French,L_Angelus,Real French taste ,1,40,11-Sep-15,I was not joining the business dinner very happily : a French restaurant in Singapore when I dreamed of street food..... But I must recognise it is real and tastes real. Good place to eat real bistro food if you wish so .
French,L_Angelus,"Cosy, elegant dining experience with top notch food",1,50,19-Aug-15,"Went there for dinner after being recommended by my good friend who knows that i adore french food.Was recommended by the chef, Reynaldo, his signature foie gras salad, along with seabass and wagyu steak.The salad was very well prepared and well balanced and the mains were delicately prepared. Perhaps this represents being able to ""taste passion"".Could tell that the food were prepared with passion and skill.Paired it with a red wine recommended by the manager and it complemented the food very well.Recommend this place for a nice dinner with your date or with friends for a quality dinner along with a comfortable and classy atmosphere.Oh one more thing to add, the creme brulee was fantastic as well!"
French,L_Angelus,Fab French in the Tropics,1,40,6-Jun-15,"A light lunch with a friend on a quiet Monday.What better place in Singapore than on Club Street as it starts to wake from the night before, at that perennial bistro, L'Angelus.The décor is traditionally Parisian bistro.The music is Piaf or some other husky throated Gallic warbler!The service is prompt.The food is delicious - a beautifully cooked salmon in a bag with a glass of Provencal RoseExcellent bistro to wind away a few hours or one short one over great, freshly cooked food!"
French,L_Angelus,Authentic experience of a French Bistro,1,40,8-Mar-15,"OK, so the staff may be a little formal, but they all speak French and a healthy number of their patrons were French speaking when my wife and I visited. So, give your French a try! Atmosphere was very authentic, but a bit more swish than a typical Parisian bistro and far more room. We had a bit of a hiccup with my wife's entree, when 45 minutes after ordering we were told that it was off the menu. However, the remainder of the meal went very smoothly and they did the right thing (my wife's replacement entree turned out to be complimentary). I had the warm goats cheese for entree, whilst my wife had a pate: both really excellent. My main meal was duck with figs: outstanding. My wife had entrecôte steak: cooked 'a point' as ordered, but quality of beef a little lacking. Superb wine list, with prices upwards of $88 (plus the irritating""++""). Definitely worth another visit."
French,L_Angelus,A truly French experience in Singapore!,1,40,4-Mar-15,"We had a brilliant meal here at the beginning of February. We found the setting and atmosphere of the place to be sufficiently French to make us forget we were not in Paris. The food and wines were of a very high quality. The service was also very French, i.e. somewhat stiff and formal (what a shame they're too proud to learn from the Italians!).If you are in Singapore and are looking for a proper ""French"" restaurant, then look no further than l'Angelus. It is extremely good – but be careful, the bill may be larger than you were expecting."
French,L_Angelus,Little charming French bistro in the heart of Chinatown's Club street area,1,40,1-Jan-15,"Great little place with extensive French wines by the bottle or glass at reasonable prices. Charming rustic decor a la Francaise and simple but delicious menu offering items such as Croque Monsieur, goats cheese tart, Croque Carillon (goats chees and bacon), lovely assortment of cheeses - small or larger plate -, crusty French breads, generous salads with mustard vinaigrette etc. etc to name but a few. There's also a very good rillette and foie gras in offer.French magazines are readily available - they are mostly recent too!Downstairs lounge area is also available for larger groups with a pool table for those interested. One of my favorite spots in this area - just wish the French owner wouldn't look so serious and perhaps give his customers a smile now and then ;-)"
French,L_Angelus,Excellent...,1,50,28-Dec-14,"Been many times but not for a few years and it did not disappoint. Walked in and it was very familiar surroundings and I immediately felt relaxed and ready for some classic French fare. Started with foie gras simply prepared but with decadence. Next was a bavette steak full of flavour, topped with shallots and accompanied with very crispy straw fries, yumm. To finish the theatrical crepe suzzette done table side. Wine is typical singapore prices but the range and quality are always there in the L'Angelus group. A great meal, well prepared with great service. Worth a try. "
French,L_Angelus,I do not understand some commentaries,1,50,21-Nov-14,I had a wonderfull evening excellent red wine with perfect temperature. Escargots and cote de veau perfect. Service. Very good. I can really recommend this place.
French,L_Angelus,Perfect comfort food for small groups,1,40,25-Sep-14,"I read some of the negative reviews and feel compelled to offer a different view. If one is looking for a perfect romantic dinner for two, perhaps this is not the place. However, if you are looking for and old fashioned brasserie with standard french comfort food that can accommodate a group of say 6,8, or 10, then L'Angelus is the perfect alternative. I was there last week with a group of 10 and there were no complaints. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges and the menu hasn't changed in years, but two or three times a year it's the perfect alternative to all the newcomers. I love the place and save it for such occasions. "
French,L_Angelus,"Charming, Cozy and Welcoming",1,50,29-Aug-14,"The first time I went here was when my friends arranged my birthday dinner here, it was kind of a surprise, and a very pleasant one. From then ive been here quite often, and it’s a perfect place if your would just want to relax, enjoy your meal have a nice conversation. If your alone, just hop on the bar stool, and the staff is kind enough to give you company, also introduce you to regulars around. The ambiance at L'Angelus is perfect for a large group to talk without having to scream over the table and its even better for a quite romantic dinner for two. The food is delicious, I love their desserts…. (There have been time Ive stopped by just for it)The staff is kind and friendly and they make you feel comfortable, from helping you with suggestions, to short conversations while you’re waiting. I'm definitely coming back more often :)"
French,L_Angelus,Better service then rumored,1,50,7-Aug-14,"We were invited to this restaurant by a collegue who lives here. Wether you choose this restaurant or another, this area is vibrant and lively. In the weekends they close off the streets from car traffic and the restaurants expand their premises to include the street as well. A beautiful area neighborhood with two story buildings called shop houses. Our friend said early that the food is among the best but the service can be up and down. On our visit - it was impeccable. When looking for a champagne we were offered to try a glass before ordering a bottle. We ha the sea bass tartar and escargot as starters and the veal for main. It all tasted superb. And for wine aficionados they had a very nice collection to try from. Bottom line - I have read the other reviews but our experience was top notch."
French,L_Angelus,Great food,1,40,1-Jun-14,"I have visited L'Angelus a number of times for dinner and even went there to celebrate dinner after my marriage registry.Every time the food is great, from the fish to the succulent steak and wonderful sides. Value-wise it's about what you would expect from a quality steak place on Club Street.The atmosphere is always lively too and the decor is pretty cool with old school posters covering the walls. It's a busy place and would recommend reserving a table.Highly recommended."
French,L_Angelus,An oldy but a goody,1,40,15-May-14,"I hadn't been to L'Angelus in years I have to say but having been back I have since been back again.L'Angelus does simple things well and in an entirely unfussy way whilst making you feel that everything is in it's proper place.Portions are more than ample, the wine list is adequate if not entirely thorough and service is brisk but efficient and knowledgable. There are more modern alternatives but for straightforward French fare, L'Angelus ticks the boxes."
French,L_Angelus,Fine French Food in the tropics,1,40,11-Apr-14,"This restaurant was an unexpected treat, an authentic feeling French restaurant in the heart of Singapore. We dined mid-week and were shown to a table straight away without having made a reservation.The menu was traditional and covered a lot of ground, with plenty of options in both the starters and main courses.We both ordered duck, a confit and roasted breast, which in both cases was beautifully prepared. The food was fabulous but remember to order a side dish if you want vegetables. The cheese course was a stand out, beautifully ripe and served at the right temperature with plenty of bread. For us the main and cheese plate was more than satisfying, although the desserts sounded wonderful too.The prices are high but this is Singapore so to be expected and you do get a good meal and service.We were even treated to an extra glass of wine at the end of our meal by the delightful French manager.One gripe, and it is a general one rather than specific to this restaurant: why can't the prices on the menu include the taxes and charges? We have to pay them anyway and having the total cost would be more honest."
French,L_Angelus,A delightful French restaurant,1,40,10-Apr-14,Dining in Singapore can often be a bland formulaic driven experience with restaurateurs driven by a desire to “produce” a cuisine and experience with matching designer driven décor and furniture. Not here. The food and wine shows a real level of care and is drawn from more than one French department. The manager was an informed and helpful sommelier with considered and constructive advice including good selections that matched our chosen desserts perfectly. He also checked on the service and food we received several times. I will return.
French,L_Angelus,"Perfect Host, excellent food",1,50,3-Mar-14,"Best dining experience in Singapore for years, food was excellent and service was ideal, host Guillaume made this one if the most enjoyable dining experiences in Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Small French Restaurant in Club Street,1,40,30-Jan-14,"L'Angelus... If you want french cuisine, just ""normal"" dishes, nothing super fancy, but really honest, then L'Angelus is the place to go. Excellent foie gras or escargots! Very good beef with a gratin dauphinois one couldn't do better at home. Nice location in Club Street, very cosy. I would go there anytime again! And i've been there on nearly all my visits to Singapore."
French,L_Angelus,Consistently good,1,40,11-Jan-14,"This year marks 10 years in Singapore and I have been here many times. Last night a group of us turned up on spec and scored a table outside, sans reservation. Result, as it meant some people-watching was enabled and now Club St is busy as anything this was all good.We had nibbled snacks at the various bars that lay littered in our trail to the restaurant so starters were declined and we went straight to mains. 3 confit de canard and 1 bavette frites were swiftly ordered and we sat back with a bottle of reasonably priced St Emilion to watch people until the food arrived.I am a big fan of confit de canard and I think L'Angelus may do the best outside France in my opinion. Succulent and tender, with crisp skin, it is an art form. The game chips with are pungent with garlic and superbly salty, just right to offset the rich duck. Our steak-eating friend was deeply impressed with his steak, so that was good too, as he paid with the company Amex. Huzzah!Another bottle of red, this time the wine of the month, which was also reasonably priced, and we waddled away pleasantly replete."

French,L_Angelus,Good French Cuisine,1,50,15-Jul-13,"My French colleague took us here, and the food did not disappoint. The service was great and we couldn't fault it, with great ambience and an interesting menu. The Terrine de Foi Gras was superb, and I had Magret de Canard (Roasted French duck breast) which was excellent. Good wine list also and one of my colleagues had Scottish salmon cooked in paper wrapping which looked superb. As my French colleague said, the chef is French and it shows!"
French,L_Angelus,Superb,1,50,23-May-13,"My hubby invited me to dinner for our 3rd wedding anniversary. L'Angelus came highly recommended by our Swiss/French friends as having an authentic French menu. Besides the high quality of French cuisine, we were especially impressed by the immaculate service that Thierry (Directeur De Salle) provided. He received at the entrance upon our arrival and immediately ushered us to the best table in the house, private yet unsecluded. Throughout the entire dinner, he always ensured that we had everything we needed and there was literally no waiting time for arrive or food.Heading a 2-men service team in a full house, it was truly no easy feat to keep the diners happy and satisfied in which Thierry succeeded very well.It was truly a magnifique dining experience for our romantic anniversary dinner. We will definitely be back again!"
French,L_Angelus,Good food and great ambiance,1,40,19-May-13,"Me and my girlfriend ate here. We were a bit in intimidated when we walk in but the staff member made us felt welcome. Menu is good. Food appetizing, delicious and very clean"
French,L_Angelus,Best french food in Singapore,1,50,31-Mar-13,"Amazing restaurant, service was fantastic, all the waiters were very knowledgeable about the food and wine served in the restaurant. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, well presented, top quality produce. Simply the best dining experience I have had in Singapore. My husband and father shared La cote de boeuf angus, it was perfectly seasoned, top quality beef - mouth watering. I ordered the roast duck, again perfectly cooked served with a delicious rich (in colour and taste) fig sauce. La pièce de résistance was the famous hot chocolate cake - Magnificat!!Go and treat yourself to a top class foodie experience. Hats off to the chef."
French,L_Angelus,Best French food I had in last 15 years.,1,50,22-Feb-13,"Amazing excellent French food.
My only very good experience in a Simgapore restaurant.
Must eat are the Escargot to be followed by Veal chop. Best items on the menu."
French,L_Angelus,Simply an excellent place to wine and dine,1,50,30-Jan-13,"I have been a proud regular for many years and never had any cause for complaint.Some diners complain that the menu hardly changes and that, I think, is due to Gabi (owner and bon vivant) understanding what works and leaving a success as it is.I do not think there are many, if any places, in Singapore to rival the ambiance here leaving it booth perfect for romancers as it is for business lunches.I cannot rate L'Angelus high enough.Absolutely love it"
French,L_Angelus,Delicious French Food,1,50,25-Jan-13,"Was there for a company dinner, food was fantastic as was the wine.
Prices were reasonable and the service OK.
Location-wise, also good as there are plenty of post-dinner places to enjoy the night air."
French,L_Angelus,ze french restaurant !,1,50,10-Dec-12,"As a french, I lived in Paris for 15 years and I have been very delighted to find out L'Angelus in Singapore. I immediatly felt at home ! After having tried many fake french restaurants (poor set, industrial food), finally, here is the good one. Home made cuisine (tasty and delicate) very good wines at a reasonable price, ""service a la francaise"" and french patrons ! For business, with friends, with your wife... or your ''maitresse"", c'est l'endroit où il faut aller !"
French,L_Angelus,Happy Suprise,1,40,14-Aug-12,"Went there last Thursday at National Day, ok was bit empty but didn't bother us. The service and Food was excellent, I was bit worried because sometimes these Restaurants in Club Street are Full of Guest anyway and I guess most Guest are just there to enjoy the Atmosphere, so some Restaurants might get bit sloppy with Service and the Quality of the Food, however L'Angelus was seem to made an exception, only little manko my Dover Sole could have been a little more Cross but that's all to complain about, nice Atmospahre like a French Bistro in Paris."
French,L_Angelus,Looking for an authentic French restaurant in Singapore? Simply the best!,1,50,11-Aug-12,"Everything is perfect from the decor to the food to the ambiance... Take a special look at the walls covered of photos of French actors and famous French plays! As for the food, it's how it's supposed to be done! Even in France, it's difficult to find a better place for traditional French cuisine! "
French,L_Angelus,Bon Appitite,1,40,2-Jul-12,"Went to L'Angelus for the first time on Saturday evening. Over all experience was good and food was excellent. Some minor issues with ambiance to note:It was Saturday evening around 9PM. A couple walked in wearing flip flops, beach short and tank tops. I was surprised the restaurant did not tell them they were not dressed appropriately. I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant and spend over 400.00 ( for 3) sitting next to people who look like they should be in a hawker centre. The restaurant should consider the feelings of the other guests. Some are there for special occasions and this just put a damper on it. Also, the wait staff and maître d left the restaurant before we were finished and after we had paid. (11pm) We were only finishing up our coffee. Felt a bit slighted to see the maitre d across the street at a martini bar after we left L'Angelus. It would have been nice to be thanked for our business and made to feel like our evening was complete.Iif you are looking to impress an important client or someone special - this may not be the place to take them. My humble opinion."
French,L_Angelus,Great French bistrot evening,1,40,12-Jun-12,"This would be one of my favourites in Singapore: friendly, straightforward and delicious French fare. The prices are on the expensive side, but this is Singapore and French food tends to be pricey.We had the streak tartare -freshly prepared in front of your table, the onion soup and the grilled foie gras.The bistrot has a basic but workable wine list: we went for a couple of glasses of Côtes du Rhone and some sparkling water.All selections were delicious and well presented, and the staff was courteous and professional. We did not have dessert, as the mains were quite filling.Expect to pay about SGD120 per person with light wine consumption.In all, a very pleasant evening. We are coming back to L'Angelus."
French,L_Angelus,Great French Bistro Style Food,1,50,8-Jun-12,"If you are looking for good quality and pretty authentic bistro style French food this is one of the places in Singapore to have it. Definitely go the Escargot for starter, assuming you like this type of thing, all the mains are great with good options for all tastes. My favorite is the duck and always check for what's on specials for the day. Wine list is good with a fair selection and a good range of pricing for Singapore.As with most good French restaurants be weary as the portions, both starters and mains are generous and generally very rich, have rarely gotten through three proper courses so if you are not a big eater decide early whether you are going for desert, if you like it there are great choices and the Creme Brûlée is almost a must."
French,L_Angelus,Nice Bistro food,1,40,18-Apr-12,"Great food for a lunch stop, price was high but reasonable for Singapore and the food worth it. Has a nice athmosphere and good service"
French,L_Angelus,Lunchtime Bistro Food At Fine Dining Prices,1,40,17-Mar-12,"Generally nice food, but very expensive for basic bistro cuisine. $46++ for Cassoulet, which is basically a bowl of baked beans with some lumps of meat, is a bit of a cheek. Nice ambience & good service, but I left feeling slightly ripped off in terms of value."
French,L_Angelus,"Delicious desserts, reasonable price",1,40,30-Jan-12,"When I eat at L’Angelus, it reminds me the Brasserie atmospheres we have in France. The place is lovely and nicely decorated with old French advertisings. The service staffs know about French cuisine, they easily give advices on the menu without pushing orders. They are thoughtful, taking back your empty dishes once you finish.Last time I went there, I had a Lyon Sausage as starter. This is quite exceptional to find such a classical French dish in Singapore and it was delicious. This kind of sausage contains pistachio; it was served with roasted potatoes. For the main, I had a perfectly medium rare cooked lamb with gratin Dauphinois. My Singaporean friend tried to prevent me for eating the lamb: he was scared I have a food poisoning because he thought the meat was undercooked! I have noticed that most people like very well done meat here but a good meat must be tender and tasty, therefore rare. Overcook a meat makes it dry and takes all the flavours off. Some French people even like their meat so rare we can still see blood at the core!! Anyway, the Chef at l’Angelus knows how to cook a good piece of meat, the lamb was perfect!The dessert was maybe my favourite. No one should leave the Angelus without trying the thin apple pie a la Normande served with a cinnamon ice-cream! The chocolate lava cake my friend too was quite common compared to the desert I choose. We spent about $100 to $120 each what is quite correct for the quality of the food served. The prices for the bottle of wine are reasonable as well.To check more restaurants, visit my blog: http://www.frenchrestaurantinsingapore.blogspot.com/"
French,L_Angelus,expensive but doesn't have to be,1,40,29-Jan-12,"When you step into L'Angelus, you certainly step into a little bit of France. This is an expensive restaurant but a great little one. Mains are around $40-50 and the starters around $20. I've lived and cheffed in France and the snails were the best I've come across especially when you put their greasy bread topping to one side. We each had the steak tartare, mixed by the front of house staff behind us and accompanied by fries. I have to say though, I love my food but this was too big a portion and just the right size for two to share. The same can be said for the creme brulee. When we go back I think we'll go all lady and the trampy and share each course. I think L'Angelus would be better served by cutting the portion sizes which would let them cut the prices. Until then... just share your meals! We had superb service despite the restaurant being full."
French,L_Angelus,Great french food,1,50,23-Nov-11,"The Chateaubriand carved at the table and potatoes dauphinoise that came with it were amazing! As were the blinis with caviar. The service was very good, wine was always topped up and even though we arrived quite late were not rushed at all. The wine list is good and really there is nothing to complain about. The place has a laid back homey feel feel to it so it is comfortable even if you are not dressed to nines. I went with a visiting friend and she is still a month later emailing about how great it was! I think its good for dates, with friends and groups and because the food is so good, also for business dinners."
French,L_Angelus,Unbelievable,1,50,21-Oct-11,"Verdict: This place takes the top spot for the best food experience I’ve ever encountered. My main meal was fantastic and the dessert topped things off. Fortunately, I got to eat a reasonable portion of my cousin’s creme brullee which was absolutely amazing. He too thoroughly enjoyed his mains, wine, and dessert. Look past the price tag, this place is a must try. At least come in for the creme brullee. Please!Price: ExpensiveTaste: DeliciousValue: ExcellentRecommendation: Highly Recommend"
French,L_Angelus,Best French Restaurant in Singapore bar none!,1,50,29-Sep-11,"The steak tartare is made fresh at your table! Tastes like heaven! If you want quality, generous French food with a very affordable wine list you have to go here!
Merci & a bientot!"
French,L_Angelus,Delicious and authentic,1,50,18-Sep-11,The Cassoulet and cheese platter were excellent! Would recommend
French,L_Angelus,Constant quality... and affordable!,1,50,12-Sep-11,"Went there 3 times for complete meals and I have to say that I enjoyed the experience a lot. The food is exactly the same quality as during my childhood (I'm French), homey style and tasty. Foie gras, Salade nicoise (the true one, with green beans), Crême brûlée (not heavy on the stomach, not too much sweetened). All these classical are done quite well, and in a generous portions... The cheeses are just mature and tasty enough, and the wine selection very worth for the price. Yes, the service is sometimes relaxed (not a person constantly looking over your shoulders), but, in my opinion, much better if you wanna appreciate the authentic atmosphere and the good food. Not the mention the excellent bread that comes with your plate and the free appetizers (peanuts and olive). This is the place to go for tasting wine and cheese, less hyped but much more worth than Wine Connection for instance..."
French,L_Angelus,"Shoosh, don't let the word get out.",1,50,16-Aug-11,"L'Angelus is a romantic French restaurant tucked away in Chinatown. It has a real Parisian flair with classic French dishes. Food is amazing, it almost makes me want to move to Singapore.Last time I was here we had pan-fried foie gras, goats cheese salad and escargot for entree and confit duck for main. The escargot was amazing but I wish I hadn't eaten on the plane as I would have loved to have the steak tartare also. Good wine selection also.L'Angelus is a place to go and enjoy with good friends or someone special."
French,L_Angelus,Excellent,1,50,17-Apr-11,"Excellent food ant atmosphere.
The steak I ate was delicious."
