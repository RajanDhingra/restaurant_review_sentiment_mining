Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Poor Marketing Collaboration,-1,30,21-Apr-17,"i have dined at Shinji at Raffles 3 times before, so on invitation of UOB Bank, I have my dinner this time at the Carlton location. I was reminded by my bank manager it's a $300 pp dinner menu, so I look forward to another great experience at Shinji.But I was very disappointed by the outcome, dishes served may have still maintained the standard, but I was surprised that I didn't get a slice of Toro and total dishes served were much lees that lunch in a cheaper menu.On my way out, I questioned the staff on my doubts that the menu worth $300pp, she quickly show me the menu starting price at $300pp, but I asked her why no Toro, no certain hot dishes I used to get etc, she was unable to comments as this is a marketing agreement with the bank etc.Actually I already suspected this kind of marketing dinner will be a modified menu though they claimed at certain price menu. My disappointment is that a premium Michelin star restaurant should not participate such kind of event, but if chose to do it, should serve the exact menu offering as usual but not modified it.Also the Chef is not as sociable as other top end sushi place like Hashida."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but expensive for what it is,-1,30,8-Jan-17,This was my 2nd visit. 1st time was 2013. Whilst I enjoyed the meal I felt it wasn't the same as the first time.... perhaps different chefs.? The service was a bit cold and I didn't find the chef engaging. Food was good but not as good compared to the likes of hashida or shoukouwa. Pricey for what it is I think.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Our experience ,-1,20,21-Dec-16,"The food in the restaurant is good but way too pricey for the quality of service they have. For the shrimp sashimi chef showed us dead and old shrimps saying that they are fresh and joking that they are ""sleeping"". We asked to replace them for fresh ones, however chef just pretended that he changed them, apparently thinking that we are fools. In the meantime, we have been to Nobu, Zuma snd other upscale restaurants which serve japanese/fusion food. We asked him again to change the shrimps and he replied that it is our fault because we got late for our sitting (the sitting was at 9 and we came there by 9:15). Later, we asked to replace this shrimp sashimi for other sushi, and the restaurant included it in the bill as ""extra"". The last and final was the desert (fruit) which was half portion in comparison to what the other customers got, who ordered the same set. Apparently it was also because we got 15 min late. Altogether we paid 750 SGD. No comments. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore","Good sushi, but a shocking experience",-1,30,2-Sep-16,"I strongly feel that I have to voice this out to warn potential patrons/customers. As much as I love and adore Shinji based on my 2 previous visits, what I encountered today is just unacceptable. As I had a heavy breakfast, I decided to opt for the 9-piece Hana lunch set menu. The head chef then went on to ask me if I like Uni (sea urchin) and said it's currently the Uni season, so the 12-piece set which includes Uni might be better for me. I replied yes, I do like Uni but today I'm feeling slightly full, so just the 9-piece set will do. Then he said 'Okay, I'll make smaller portions of the rice for you.' Thinking that it's just a kind gesture from the chef, I proceeded with my lunch. Slowly, 8 pieces of sushi were served and to my surprise, I was served Uni for the 9th piece. I knew something wasn't right. In the end, I was served 12 pieces of sushi when I have opted for 9 and yup I was charged $125++ for the 12-piece set lunch.Don't get me wrong, the sushis were brilliant, worthy of the michelin star, but I'm not sure if this behaviour is acceptable. So, the next time you decide to have lunch at Shinji, maybe repeat your order so the Chef gets it right, I don't know."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not my best Omakase,-1,30,16-Dec-15,"3rd omakase experience. Came with high expectation because of good reviews I've heard. The sushi and ingredients were certainly very fresh, but freshness is the basic expectation of any Japanese cuisine in my opinion. In terms of artistic presentation, it was mediocre. Taste wise, every dish was good but did not bring me to heaven. Still, Hide remains top on my list. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Lost sushi.,-1,20,7-Dec-15,"I have had the opportunity to try many fine sushi establishment so my review is base on peer to peer comparison. I had high expectations for Shinji but my friend and I were underwhelmed, the fish was fresh although my mackerel had a very strong smell which was distracting. Second, the cut of the fish was wrong. You should be able to chew the fish and not have their tendons spent stuck on your teeth. My friend had to ask for tissue to spit out the tuna which she could not chew. This was unacceptable already. Third, the rolls were not appetizing to your sight. The toro was falling apart. My tuna maki was not cut cleanly and worse of all, rice was stuck outside of the roll. This is something you would expect from the third grade sushi place but not one of this caliber. Fourth, the rice was not delicious. It was not fragrant nor was it warm. When you visit a fine sushi establishment it is usually not the fish that you should be mesmerized by, but for me it is the rice. Shinji did not inspire me. There was no passion in the plating, or care for ingredient. It was as if I went to one of those popular restaurants who know that they are popular and took their eyes off the quality. My plate was never cleaned, the fish was cut recklessly, and overall shameful example of what it should be."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Overpiced for what it si,-1,20,10-Jul-15,"Don't think it's worth to spend this much money on sushi. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just way overpriced. There are plenty of other options for great sushi in Singapore to spend your money on/"
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Is it worth it?,-1,30,24-May-15,"Shinji is not a 2 Michellin star restaurant: its chef has been awarded 2 stars but not for this restaurant. Shinji serves the best sashimi I have ever tasted. Bar none. But in the end, it is raw seafood. Ain't no big deal. Its wine list is limited but its Saki menu is extensive. If you walk out of there for less than $900 Singapore dollars you have done well. If you book a table at the Sushi bar don't expect a private dining experience. I'm pleased we went there but pleased my partner paid. It is so over-rated that I would not go back. But, been there, done that. Tick."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good experience but once is enough,-1,30,16-Apr-15,"At the cost of 300 over dollars per head, I thought I would be served lobster, tuna belly or some horse meat sashimi. But none of the above. Instead , I get run of the mill type of fish like red snapper, tuna , yellowtail and octopus. But to give credit to the chef, the fish served are really fresh and the sea urchin (uni) has got a tinge of sweetness rather than the salty taste usually associated with it. Service and ambience are acceptable. Overall, the quality of food served is good and I never thought i'd say this but the best part of the meal was the fruit dessert. The honey melon was outstanding. It had this soft, translucent texture and tasted of bubble gum and wine. Unfortunately, the portion was small and it left me wanting for more. I would recommend this restaurant only if you or your loved one are celebrating a special occasion and want to splurge. But for the price, for me, once is good enough."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Worst service,-1,10,4-Apr-15,Eaten here few times but this time around the chef probably thought too much of their popularity. We paid sgd500 per head and at the end when my wife wanted to order an additional handroll because she was hungry the chef pointed at his wrist and said times up. Basically we had to leave. Food was also served in a hurried manner. Is this the service we expect from a supposedly fine dining restaurant?? Maybe in Singapore but definitely not in Japan.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Underwhelming.....,-1,20,15-Feb-15,"I previousy had lunch at Shinji (Raffles Hotel) and it was a good experience. Hence my wife and I were looking forward to our dinner in Shinji. The welcome and initial impression was good and was as expected. After ordering our drinks, we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait.Eventually I figured out that there was an event going on in the private room next door. The chef serving us our omakase dinner was apparently tasked to prepare the food for them. So when we sat down at 7.45pm, and finished 2 beers and 1 bottle of sake, after 30 minutes - the appetizer arrived.My first piece of sushi arrived at 9.30pm and by then, the guests next to us and us as well, were getting a little hungry - just a wee bit. All through this time, our sushi chef could not talk to us as he was just too busy. In fact he did not even top up the preserved ginger. Which was terrible because that was all I was able to eat for the previous 45 minutes.And the dinner really started at 10pm (when the private room has finished eating), and that's when he served the 2nd piece of sushi - lucky us!!The dinner finished by 10.30pm. While the sushi and quality of food was top notch, I think that the pace of dinner is NOT acceptable. Jiro in Tokyo would have finished the entire meal in 45 minutes. All in all, it was quite an unpleasant experience.I should think if there is an event that the restaurant cannot cope, don't take further reservation. I guess in future, if you want attentiveness as part of your meal here, be sure to be very rich and book the private room. If not, be prepared to feel distinctly second class. Either that or perhaps order the most expensive omakase (mine was the ""middling level"" omaskase), perhaps then you may be deemed worthy of their attention. Good sushi though...no, actually excellent sushi. What a pity."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not worth it. Completely overrated and expensive,-1,20,31-Jan-15,"We arrived for dinner at this lovely restaurant. The lovely lady welcomed us warmly and with a smile which is rare in Singapore. The restaurant offers 3 package meals, the cheapest is the 15 sushi piece meal with soup and is $220 per pax.We ordered the sushi meal and immediately the lady's face changed and in front of us crossed eyes with the chef and rolled their eyes. The chef asked us if we were sure that we didn't want sashimi. We confirmed that we wanted only sushi and answered with a disproving tone as if he was too tired to make all that sushi or wasn't worth his while.The course menu was ok but nothing spectacular, the rice was hard and uncooked, the nigiri felt apart. This is not a bad restaurant but it's not worth what they charge and does not deserve the reputation.As a plus, the chef accepted several sake shots from another customer and by the end of our course he was happily drunk and very distracted. He also accepted tips very happily. Not something you would expect from a Japanese chef of this category."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Food poisoning,-1,10,17-Dec-14,"Severe food poisoning after the Omakase Shin meal. We had dinner and around midnight, I felt that my stomach was very uncomfortable but didnt think much about it. Around 2am, I stared vomiting and this repeatedly went on throughout the night (vomited at least 5 times throughout the night and at least 7 in total including the next day)Reached out to Shinji to check into the cleanliness and was told that they uphold food hygiene to the highest standards and that stomachs react differently to a particular ingredient although they would still check on the menu. In the end, they came back and said that the chef looked into the menu and no other customers had any stomach upset. This was not our first time going to a fine dining Japanese restaurant and this has never happened. I have not even had food poisoning ever since I could rememberNot worth paying SGD600 per pax for food poisoning."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Good but less than I expected,-1,30,3-Dec-14,"Don't get me wrong, this is exceedingly good sushi in a nice environment and sitting at the sushi bar watching the very talented chef do his thing was a great experience. On these points I would probably give a 4-star rating however given how ridiculously expensive the restaurant is, it needs to be offering more than just good sushi and it fails to reach the heights of other places I've eaten that were priced (a little) more reasonably. The final piece of fish was basically a grilled/roasted shrimp head which was frankly unpleasant and only one of our party was able to eat all of it. So overall good, but there is far better value out there and I'll try somewhere else next time. "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",$250 w/o tax for an AWFUL lunch Omakase! ,-1,10,27-Jul-14,"Was too excited when I got Shinji's reservation, been hearing really good reviews about this restaurant. I learned it the hard way. Shinji is a rip off. For $250, without tax (almost $300 with service charge and tax) we got the lowest quality of fish, maybe it was not my lucky day?? Or they thought ""Indonesians will pay anyways, they don't understand"" oh heck yes, I DO! We didn't even get chutoro or ootoro, and only 2 bites of Uni (a sushi and a dish). So what's so good about this restaurant? Maybe the one in St. regis is better? Never coming back. Awful awful awful omakase experience! Save your money and go to tatsuya, you won't regret it! "
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",A terrible Experience,-1,10,31-Dec-13,"Was part of a group planning to enjoy a delightful Christmas Eve dinner at this posh eatery. Our group arrived promptly at the reception just before 7' 0 clock which was our reservation time and waited expectantly to be seated. It was here where things went terribly wrong. Suddenly upon seeing our group, the lady receiving us ducked to the back quickly and called the manager out. The manager , smiling cheerfully, told us that our reservation had been cancelled by herself because a confirmation was not obtained even though the booking was made less than four days earlier. Our host who dines at the restaurant regularly had called the restaurant and was assured of a booking. After looking through her records, the Manager again, cheerfully, told us that the number they had taken down was indeed a wrong number as they mis-wrote one digit in the phone number. What a wonderful mistake as apparently phones nowadays don't have caller ID. They then somehow pulled out an unknown email address and were sending emails to some unknown party to confirm the reservation which was made four days earlier. So our group was left there without a reservation and refused entry by the smiling manager who couldn't be bothered by us by then as the restaurant was full. She basically summarized it as the restaurant had tried its best but mistakes do happen and cheerfully walked away and shut the door leaving our party stranded on Christmas Eve without even hearing our host's full explanation. 'Surprisingly', we did hear stories of regulars securing last minute spaces at the restaurant even though it was full. Apparently the manager will always see what she 'can' do. I would like to say thank you to that particular Manager for providing such exceptional service to our group on Christmas Eve and salute her for providing an experience we will never forget.This experience was thoroughly harrowing and we didn't expect this from an establishment supposedly dubbed the 'best Japanese Restaurant in Singapore' located in the famed Raffles Hotel. For those who are thinking of trying this place, consider Ki-Sho along Scots Road, they will most certainly honour your booking and ensure your party an enjoyable meal with exceptional food which will not be at the expense of others."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",average high end sushi at premium price,-1,30,24-Oct-13,"It was a nice place with rather good sushi in omakase style. Service was tremendously good. However, SGD260 without any alcohol and it was just the cheapest set, this must be a joke. There is surely something wrong with the pricing mechanism. Anyway, putting that aside, Shinji by Kanesaka is a fine sushi place. But do not expect something world class like in Japan as you won't get the fish as good when it has to fly all the way from Japan."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",over rated,-1,20,25-Jan-13,"Certainly superb sushi amazing specialities like abalone, urchin and puffer fish butThe Chef who prepares the food in front of you and is obviously an expert isn't an expert in communication certainly in english,we had more explanation of dishes from the prawns that were still alive!The main problem is the food is insubstantial, there is no decent portion of fish and no steak, too much sushi and not enough sashimi, ok maybe its authentic but i left unsatisfied. Theres no imagination just a lot of really nice raw fish and some small cooked dishes also nice but not superb a grizzly bear does a similar job.For 600$ a head i felt id had a really nice starter. In my opinion it doest compare to Nobu London or even Zuma and certainly not a patch on the food served in the aman resorts I've visited.Service is excellent although you only get wasabi with some dishes."
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Excellent Japanese food but better be invited,-1,30,3-Oct-12,The place to be in Singapore for the Japanese food lovers. The restaurant surfs on a wave thanks to a two-Michelin-starred restaurant linked to this one; having said this the quality of the food is excellent and everything is quite fresh and the dressing perfect. The service quality is also nice and the chef does not hesitate to visit personally his guests at the tables. Only shadow : excessive prices.
Japnese,"Shinji by Kanesaka, Singapore",Not sure if it is worth,-1,30,10-Dec-11,"I visited shinji on mid November. It has nice authentic decor with beautiful wooden counter. We order omakase. Entire experience was ok but I just simply felt painful when I paid the bill (nearly $600). Of course with this price it should be good quality but I ususally concern the cost performance and it makes me feel not worth for it. As I mentioned it was ok. Food is good, Service honestly so so, ambience very good. I believe this price range should show something special and wow theguest. Just it doesn't make me feel happy after the meal like everybody commented and make me feel to come back. If I am rich, it doesn't matter but I rather recommend to go to Japan and have same quality in more reasonable price even pay for the air ticket."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointments with this so call 1 Michelin Star Restaurant ,-1,10,10-Jun-18,"Total disappointing experienced to celebrated my Birthday in this restaurant. When the restaurant first newly opened in Mbs we visited the restaurant was wayu beef steak served for each guest, after the restaurant got Michelle Star we were back to this restaurant again due to we missed n love foods to our surprised was such a disappointment the wayu beef steak became a slice of beef each guest. Menu remained the same, price the same but amt of beef is cut down. N during payment time, they asked whether we have Mbs memberships card, which I told them I had registered few months ago but I haven’t collect the physical card frm the mbs Customer service n i told them I hav ecard in my phone but the staff insisted she wanted the physical mbs Memberships card , without the physical card she cannot credit the points, which was kind of disappointed. Few days later I went to Mbs Customer Service counter to collect my card n told them about the incident I had in waku ghin , the staff in waku ghin requested me to show them my physical card then can credit points so the Mbs customer service staff actually told me show e card memberships frm the phone also can credit points. After hearing my incident the mbs customer service staff requested me to let them photo copy the receipt to help me appeal . Unfortunately, waku ghin refused to credit back those points. This is a so call 1 Michelin Star Service "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Food quite good but Standards have obviously dropped,-1,30,1-Jun-18,"This is our 2nd time there. The 1st being some time back before they were awarded the Michelin star. We had a very good impression the first time. With that reference point in mind, and taking into consideration it is now Michelin star restaurant - we walked away this time sadly disappointed. On the whole the food was still quite good. But for S$ 450 per pax and 1 star - we expected better overall dining experience. Let me illustrate point for point below. As background, this was a birthday celebration for my wife. (1) This special event and her dietary restriction have been clearly spelt out to the restaurant by email of which they have acknowledged. Yet upon being seated. We were asked the same questions again ad verbatim per their email. And to cap it, they asked in front of both of us, if this was a special occasion. I wonder does anyone read the correspondences? Anyway, so much for any surprise dinner occasion there. They ensured the element of surprise is gone. (2) The ohmei A5 beef were of best quality. However, they sliced it so thin in the way of sabu sabu style. It is sacrilegious to use such thin slice on the teppan hot plate. That was just poor use of great beef. Teppan hot plate should always use steak cut and NEVER paper thin slice. (3) Abalone - This was soaked in anchovy sauce that was too strong and the sauce overpowered the natural taste of fresh abalone. Another no-no. (4) Dessert - This was the biggest surprise of all. They gave us a small birthday cake with candle. After the blowing of candle etc, they gave us 2 small slices from it. What happened to the rest of the cake - was a mystery. Normally more restaurants would have packed the rest of it for us. But Waku Ghin was really unusual in this aspect. So now we waited for our degustation set dessert. Normally most top restaurants pride themselves of their artistry and creativity of dessert. But Waku strangely does not. In fact, it appears the 2 small slice of cake above was our degustation dessert. Again this is highly irregular. Most top restaurant would have given a complimentary slice of cake followed by the proper dessert set. In addition, maybe even a dessert trolley. So on the whole for the price and the restaurant ranking - the restaurant need to do way better then that. I felt there has been a some fair bit of cutting corners on cost. The grace and classiness were just missing in this place. At the end of the day, we just remembered it as a rather expensive restaurant that does not provide value nor the requisite service.As a digression. The close comparable in style and food would be U-kai tei in Tokyo which is also 1 Michelin star. But this one beats Waku Ghin hands down in quality of service and food. For that, I would always do seconds or thirds, unfortunately I cannot say the same of Waku."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",What a joke !,-1,20,23-Dec-17,"Everything is in the title... Good products for sure, but almost no work on them, same menu since day one, those small ""Teppanyaki rooms"" where the Teppanyaki is almost not used, but the exhaust noise above your head is working well, maybe to break the ice cold ambiance in this restaurant. Nothing that my palate will remember. But a paradise for all the people who eat with their eyes (and mostly social network junky).The only thing I will not forget, is the bill..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",More a branding and marketing exercise,-1,20,26-Oct-17,"Extremely disappointed – as someone who had enjoyed Tetsuya’s food for decades from his early days at Rozelle, it was a total letdown. Of the many meals we have had at Tetsuya’s this wouldn’t rank in the top 50.The rating reflects more the $ charged and the lack of meeting expectations – the food had a certain quality but not to be compared with Andre, Nouri, Odette’s, Blackwattle etc. where we had dined the previous few days.It’s not though that we created these expectations, they promote Tetsuya Wakuda extensively and you naturally make some assumptions.As the Marina Bay Sands says “With its long list of awards, Waku Ghin is universally acclaimed as one of the very best restaurants in Singapore. Tetsuya Wakuda’s masterful European Japanese dishes are created in front of diners’ eyes by personal chefs for an unmatched fine dining experience”I’ve eaten at so many of the world’s best Chefs Tables in the past couple of years and this doesn’t compare.Typically, the chef does everything in front of you from showing the produce, to preparation, then cooking and presentation to the diner – all the while involving the diner and discussing what he is doing.At Waku Ghin, not only was the chef relatively young (and by comparison to Tetsuya, inexperienced) but he rarely talked and seemed almost embarrassed being asked questions.There was no interaction and no involvement that perhaps would have made it worth half the money.The dishes were not created in front of us, the preparation was done in an outside kitchen and then brought to the bench in front of us where the young chef played and then served without communication.In our home town, have enjoyed Raita where all my expectations have been met at less than half the price and the seafood has been even fresher.Tetsuya should be embarrassed – the final insult was the finishing touch of giving my wife a fruit jelly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally not worth it!,-1,30,12-Sep-16,"Nothing to shout about.....food was alright, not fantastic. Over rated & overpriced!!!! There are many other restaurants in Singapore that are a lot better. If you want to experience some extra-ordinary culinary delight, don't waste your money on this one."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",disappointing,-1,10,3-Sep-16,"What’s all the fuss about? Nothing special. In fact for these prices (one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore) it was profoundly disappointing. They appeared to be doing things to win them Michelin stars and to impress rather than make interesting and tasty food and be sincere. There wasn’t a single dish which stood out on my fish/meat menu and the person I was with's vegetarian one. There are better Japanese restaurants at Pan Pacific and even Kinki beats it. Not worth the money, wine was exceedingly overpriced even for Singapore and the whole experience wasn’t especially enjoyable. Felt forced and insincere."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Is the crazy price for the ingredients or culinary skills or the venue?,-1,30,18-Aug-16,"After the dinner three months ago, I was still not in a position to answer the question above, because the ingredients are all high-end, the venue is exclusive but the culinary skills? Honestly I can't tell. I can't even recall any memorable dishes any more ..."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Dinner and Cocktail at the Bar,-1,30,12-Mar-16,"We started with mojitos carefully prepared and offering a very refreshing start to dinner. For starters we had the Aburi Tasmanian petuna ocean trout with a hint of chili and the Lobster sandwich. They were good and refreshing though calling it the Lobster sandwich a sandwich was a total misunderstanding of the word sandwich. It was just lobster meat in a bisque with two pieces of toasted bread on the side.Next came the Spaghetti with lobster and Spaghetti with king crab. They were both good but unexciting, with no highlights to stimulate our taste buds. They could use a better quality of pasta. The third movement came with Grilled wagyu beef on rice, a very tasty and favoursome offering and the Marinated tuna (Tonbo) set on seasoned rice. Compared with the Grill beef rice, this was really a let down. The seasoned rice is dominated by the vinegar used in the seasoning. The rice was too mushy for our taste. For drinks, we had Negroni, Waku Ghin martini and a Waku Ghin citrus. All tasty and exciting drinks to go with the food. However what stand out is the baby peach cured in truffle oil. An excellent accompaniment to the martini. Each bite explodes with favours. However, there was one on the mushy side, indicating a spoilt baby.They were many service staff but no one opened the doors for us. But finally made up for in the send off.Summary out of 10 points:Food 6, Bar List 8, Ambience 7, Food Value 5, Cocktail Value 6"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",5 years and NO menu changes,-1,10,24-Jan-16,"Since the past 5 years it's the 3rd time I have been invited to Waku Ghin.My first visite was definitely a 5 stars rating, the 2nd 3 and the 3rd deserved this terrible point.The first visit with this OMAKASE menu, (meaning for me that it's a daily preparation and chef Tetsuya will have a lot of creation and will follow the season), was good even if the portion were RIDICULOUSLY small and didn't deserved the SGD 400++, but what to do with this aspect of the Japanese cuisine...For my 2nd visit the menu was exactly the same, did chef Tetsuya built his reputation with 1 menu, with only 8courses?The answer on my last trip.... YES!!! SERIOUSLY.....Almost the same menu with the same display... But now the worst is the confidence and the arrogance of your teppan ""chef"" that assumed they don't have to do the job as the reputation is established in the 50best.SGD400++ and had a Macdo or food court because you are still hungry is absolutely a joke and a tourist trap for MBS."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Very overpriced, no atmosphere and average food",-1,20,26-Dec-15,"Please do read all the reviews in the ""poor category"", they are spot on. We are a relatively young couple (early 30s) who go to these types of restaurants a couple of times a year. We can afford to go (not every week!) but we also expect a lot as they are a treat for us. If you meet this criteria then hopefully our review is helpful - please don't go here, it's a huge waste.Waku Ghin has to be the biggest disappointment we've ever experienced, and the most expensive (we spent twice what we spent at the fat duck, and it was a significantly less amazing experience).Do they do anything wrong? Not really but it's that they don't really do anything amazing and with this price tag, you really have to (for two people, it cost approx GBP 800 or around USD 1,500 - we had matched wines, also there was about $150 in tax and another $150 in service, added to the quoted prices). So here's what really didn't work for us:FOODThe menu is omakase, so the chef chooses the food. At no point were we given a menu of what was to come or emailed after, which was disappointing (even though the waiter said we would be). The chefs often announced the meals before they were served but their English was not great so often we had no idea - appreciate the benefits of having Japanese chefs but at these prices - and not being in Japan - we would expect there to be some way to convey what we were eating and some information about it. At points there were young female helpers who came over -not quite sure of their role other than occasionally to clarify what the chefs had said, but this certainly didn't happen for every course.The food itself was fine - our favourites were the oysters, sea urchin and abalone. The rest was fine but nothing special. To top it off my husband felt pretty unwell at the end of it.WINEIt seemed odd to be asked about wine straight away when we had no idea about what food we were being served (see above). We felt forced to do matched wines as they weren't forthcoming with information to allow us to pick a bottle and weren't particularly helpful (there didn't appear to be a sommelier to talk us through the options). Either way the bottles of wine were so expensive it actually seemed sensible to do the wine pairing at $250 per head - that gives you an idea about the cost of the wine list. Although three of the wines in the wine pairing were sake, so if you aren't a fan of sake then it's a bit of a waste. The other pairings were pretty good.SERVICEBoth the waiters and chefs seemed robotic and not actually interested in engaging with us, other than to serve the food and say what they needed to. You are seated in small rooms with a chef preparing the meals - we tried to engage but didn't really get anywhere and it was quite uninspiring (compared with Burnt Ends we had been to the day before which was great to watch).ATMOSPHEREUrgh. So dull. We were seated in a room with four other people. There is no ambience. I would say this vibe might work for older businessmen and that's about it. Certainly not for couples - not good for a special occasion. Just lacks any ambience.All in all, we would recommend avoiding Waku Ghin. Save yourself the money - this just isn't up there with the top restaurants. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Interesting but overall not as inspiring as I would have imagined,-1,30,23-Aug-15,This was a good meal don't get me wrong. I liked the way you were seated in a group setting (I was on my own) and got you seat at the cooking table. The presentation of the fish was excellent and some of the courses were truly great. But some were really very average. The wine choices were relatively expensive - even by this type of restaurant standards. My bill for one person came to 630 Singapore dollars. That makes this one of the most expensive meals I have had in the last two years. This didn't make the top 5 meals and might not make the top 10 if I go back and look at it. So that's why it gets an average.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Over the top,-1,30,4-Aug-15,"I've heard that this type of ""ultra fine-dining"" is going out of fashion in Singapore. I must say after visiting Waku Ghin I can understand why. We expected the ten course menu to be decadent, but with such rich flavours heavy on protein we found it difficult to enjoy much past the 5th. This was largely due to the pace the courses came out - we barely had time to finish our matched wine before the next glass was being poured. Perhaps we eat more slowly than the other diners, however we believe an experience like this is to be savored. There were some stand-out dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed, such as the sea urchin with prawn and caviar. The heavier dishes such as the lobster were not to our taste. Moving to a more intimate setting for desert was a nice touch. The $1500 bill at the end of the night was expected but was it ten times better than other meals we've had in Singapore? Probably not."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Sadly Disappointed,-1,30,24-Jul-15,"I went to this restaurant with such high hopes (50 Best in the World, Friends highly recommended, etc etc…), I was summarily disappointed however. The food, yes, was quite tasty, was it worth what we were charged for it, however, no. We are more than willing to dole of money on a special dinner, this just wasn't all that special. It all just felt forced and a bit rushed (my brother characterized it as Benihana's Logical Maximum). We enjoyed the use of the Teppan grill and our chef was friendly. As a whole it just wasn't on par with its peer competitors we have dined at around the globe, especially given the exorbitant price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Too expensive for average food,-1,20,11-Jul-15,"I've been to many top restaurants around Singapore but Waku Ghin was the most disappointed restaurant on my list. This was my first time here and will never ever come back to this over-rated restaurant. I was served with cheap and low quality seafood for $400/pax. A bottle of water is $20sgd. One small boston lobster was served for 4 people... Small abalones werent even from Australia and the beef was cheap. I think with the money I spent, I can fly to Japan to eat something better. Avoid this place if you expect good food for $400/pax. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Part of the world's 50 best restaurants? Something is wrong here!,-1,30,12-Jun-15,"$400 each degustation dinner plus 10% service + 7% tax; now add $20 for a bottle of water ++ and $22 for a cocktail ++... so, dinner for two including two bottles of water and one cocktail $1100!!! Which we would have paid without pain if we would have had an amazing unforgettable meal as we expected but sadly this was not the case. Out of the 10 courses we only enjoyed the Shrimp with Sea Urchin topped with Caviar and the two slices of Kobe. We are aware that a degustation menu means small portions but honestly these people take this too seriously, our Charcoal Grilled Fillet of Tasmanian Grass-fed Beef with Tetsuya's Wasabi Mustard was ridiculously tiny!! I could even count the rocket leaves put in the plate as garnish. I won't make this review too long but the last savory dish Consommé with Rice and Snapper deserve a mention. I hardly found the fish and the consommé was so light and clear that with all due respect I have had better consommés at the hospital, sorry for the honesty. Same to say about the dessert. Melon? and a chocolate mousse? That was pretty ordinary for such an extravagant price! So disappointed after such a wonderful experience at Tetsuya in Sydney. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Really disappointed,-1,20,12-Jun-15,we are really sorry for Mr Tetsuya but this restaurant is nothing compared with the one in Sydney. It was good seeing him at the restaurant welcoming the guests.It all started very well with the display of fresh sea food to be served followed by the sea urchin signature dish but that was it. The portion size were very small to the ridiculous size of the Tasmanian cape grind steak to close with a bland consommé containing white rice and poached fish. We really expected more for S$1100 for two people.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Sorry, this restaurant is over-rated",-1,30,31-May-15,"We REALLY wanted to love this Japanese restaurant. I mean it's rated 1 of the top restaurants in Asia! The service was lovely and attentive but for the price, there are so many other fantastic restaurant choices in Singapore that are more reasonably priced and the food is better. We ordered the 10 course menu with wine pairing. The ""signature"" dish was a marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar - and while it looked beautiful, I didn't like it. I think it was one of those dishes that you either love or hate. For such as spendy place, I wanted to eat food that really wow'ed me. The closest I got to ""wow"" was the wagyu roll with fresh wasabi (delicious) and the abalone with pasta. One of our waiters kept telling us this was a French restauratn - there is just no way! It is totally Japanese and I'm sorry to say that the food is over-rated."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive for average food,-1,20,6-Apr-15,"Second time round - why didn't I learn from my first experience? - both times were equally disappointing. Its about 500/pax if you dont have a lot of drinks. The food was nothing special - the gimmick is that they cook some dishes in front of like a teppanyaki - but it does mean if you are a couple, the timing of your dishes matches the other couple in the room. Their special is the uni, botan and cavier dish -but standard has dropped from last time because my first time round it was the only earth-shattering dish but this time it was less creamy, didn't blend as well and therefore forgettable. All the dishes were forgettable except for the wagyu beef which was the only good dish in the entire 10 menu. Completely disappointing"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Seriously!!!!,-1,30,17-Mar-15,"Was the experience relatively enjoyable? Yes. Was it worth $800 per person?No. Adjectives that come to mind. Pretentious & deceitful. Pretentious I was expecting. Deceitful not so much. On arrival we were offered Dom champagne in a gestural manner that implied it was on the house! The bottle was already open! It then appeared on the bill as a $550.000 open alcohol item! You would be right to think that our asking would be a sensible thing to do - but the feeling is 'if you have to ask, you shouldn't be there'. Any way, my advice: If your being shouted - go.If you feel the need to be showy - go If spending $1600 per couple on dinner is chum change - goYou are a major foodie - go If you do not fit into the above - don't go."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Average ,-1,30,20-Nov-14,"With so many other places to have good japanese food in singapore (which aren't cheap either), this restaurant is really expensive!! Perhaps it's the fact that its in Mbs. But it's not bad, it's more for the atmosphere than the food I would say"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Over rated and very expensive,-1,30,30-Oct-14,"The place has very nice ambiance. Foods are just average but very pricey. The service ws very good. Tried it once, guess that's enough for me."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Totally overrated - nothing special,-1,20,26-Oct-14,"The style of dining here is interesting. The courses are comprised of excellent quality ingredients, and some are reasonably enjoyable. The sommelier is terrible, and showed no indication of having any knowledge of wine whatsoever - best to make your own choices. Deserts well below average. Overall, very disappointing even without regard to the cost of dining here. There are much better options in Singapore (including, as the last reviewer suggested, The Tippling Club, and Tetsuya's in Sydney is streets ahead."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Don't believe the hype. Go to the Tippling Club instead.,-1,10,8-Oct-14,"We had high expectations of this restaurant on the basis of glowing reviews and previous positive meals at Tetsuya's in Sydney but sadly these were ill founded. The meal was good for the most part but not great but certainly not worth $400 per head. The 10 course menu is very meagre and small items which would usually be considered amuse bouche or palate cleansers are included as full courses. 2 or 3 of the dishes were memorable but not knock-out, including the kobe beef though this could also have been down to the fact that the portion size was so small - only half a small steak each. Dessert was small (notice a theme here!) and slightly boring. The options for those with dietary restrictions are also unspectacular and lacking in variety. My husband's first two substitute dishes looked identical. In addition, they were not prepared on the teppan and appeared from a hidden kitchen leaving diners with restrictions feeling less carefully catered for and therefore distinctly unloved. The sommelier had no idea about the wine selection and suggested entirely inappropriate but expensive wines despite a very careful description of what we wanted. Overall, a very disappointing experience. We had been fortunate enough to have a superb meal at The Tippling Club in Tanjong Pagar a few days beforehand which was truly spectacular and less than 2/3 of the price of Waku Ghin. If you want something really special, head to The Tippling Club instead and ask for a seat at the counter where you'll see some really interesting cooking in their open plan kitchen."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Expensive and Overrated - Benihana on Steroids,-1,30,8-Aug-14,"Well.... for the 7th best restaurant in the world, it was a disappointment. The service was amazing and at the same time lacking. You sit at a high hibachi table identical to Benihana. Only 3 courses are prepared in front of you, the other 7 or 8 are served from the kitchen. Your seafood is presented to you at the beginning of the meal and some still alive, which is fine.After the presentation it was hard to talk across all 5 us laterally. If were less than 5 then another 2 people would have been seated with us and would have had to join the family conversation.After dinner you are moved to the back room for desert, which is actually to open the table for the next sitting. For the price paid $400 per person plus 7% Marina Bay Sands service charge plus GST plus 10% tip plus drinks or wine it becomes a truly large bill. The Wagyu Beef and Lobster Braised was excellent, the other courses were ok but not a wow.It just comes across as a Las Vegas style, very expensive hotel restaurant. I would not go back and would recommend other Singapore eateries especially for what they charge and what you get for that price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Nice, but so expensive",-1,30,15-Jul-14,"I like to taste many bites for different flavor experiences. The chef knows what he's doing undoubtedly. The problem is that when we got out of the restaurant we weren't only hungry but disappointed...we paid 1.600 $, and we didn't think it was amazing...they charged a bit than 11$ for very very small coffee, considering what we were already paying. The staff attention is good, flavor is good, but I honestly don't think that the price is right. I like the fact that we had the opportunity to go, but wouldn't repeat it. "
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Waku Ghin - not that Great!,-1,30,8-Jun-14,"Was with a friend to celebrate her 40s birthday at Waku Ghin the food quality is very good, top notch and very fresh, we trully enjoyed every course of it till the end. However the Sommerlier's recommendation of each course of wine pairing is very bad taste! We told him at the start we don't want a lot of the drink but would like to taste the different pairing with each course, at the end the wine were too much and the birthday girl was feeling unwell. My feedback is ""food should make you feel good likewise for drink too"" you want to enjoy it and not feel sick after a meal. His comment was the drink amount is standardized, if it's it should be McD that is standardized ... for the price we have paid I expect customization. I enjoyed my last year experience with the Sommerlier at Andre he was personalized!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",A long long way to go for dinner.,-1,30,17-May-14,"Restaurant Waku Ghin , Number 7 on the list of Asia`s best restaurants , Number 50 in the World 2014 and the Singapore base of Japanese chef Tetsuya Wakuda, a bit of a shining star of Japanese cuisine and media. The only reason I went to Singapore was to eat here so i was expecting big things and to be honest the `Meal of a lifetime`.The restaurant is situated within Singapore`s Marina Bay Sands hotel which nowadays is the country`s most identifiable landmark…..think of Singapore and you immediately connect with the triple towers and the swimming pool table top. The cost of this complex was “8 Billion” Singapore dollars. The restaurant itself is a bit of a strange place to get to so allow plenty of time if you`re going. Its on the first floor above the huge casino. I tried to get in via the casino but was politely turned away as i didn`t have my passport. I was sent through the exclusive shopping mall , up a lift and onto a totally deserted floor where i had to scout around before spotting the Waku Ghin restaurant sign.When i arrived i was the only diner in the restaurant. It got a little busier throughout the evening but generally i found the atmoshpere to be a bit awkward. No music…only silence. Waku Ghin ( Spring forth and Arise / Silver ) interior is split into various small rooms, each containing a set of seats and a counter housing an immaculate griddle. The restaurant where i was dining only had 5 counter seats so that was 5 of us dining on the early sitting. The other two couples arrived shortly after i had been seated , both couples arrived and sat in silence.It was bloody awkward to say the least .I chose not to drink wine as the prices were bordering on plain silly so i went for a cold Tiger Beer at $16 (£7.60) and a bottle of mineral water at $20 (£9.50) Justify that if you can.I left the restaurant feeling as though i`d just been kicked squarely in my Gonads . I very rarely whinge about a meal as you`ll see from my many blog posts but on this occasion i felt very differently. My Bill came in at $ 513 dollars ( £244 ) with no wine. The Tasmanian Beef course was omitted from the menu.The Abalone was “portion controlled”. The fine flavoured Wagyu was overpowered by the fresh Wasabi.The signature Cheesecake never appeared and i was served a “slice of Melon”…….We live and learn. I had a relaxing stroll around the stunning Marina Bay , took aboard a few thoughts on my life and then went and spent $2 dollars on an amazing bowl of Chicken noodle soup and a stir fry in Chinatown……finally , the food hit the mark."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Can be better,-1,30,13-Aug-13,"Family of 3 went in February 2013 for dinner. Maybe I came here with too much expectation. I was not impressed, atmosphere was stiff and the service is not that great with exception of the chef who prepared the food in your presence and one or 2 of the waiters. Unlike some other restaurant of the same calibre or price range it lacks the wow factor. Moreover there was not much privacy, people are watching you all the time. Chairs are also not too comfortable. Food was just average. Will only go back if someone else is willing to give me a treat which I think is not quite possible except my hubby."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good food but expensive,-1,30,29-Jun-13,Its a great restaurant however its pretty damn pricey! The uni and caviar dish was amazing but then again how do you go wrong with uni and caviar? I dont think it was worth the money but im glad i went to check it out anyways.
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Mixed feelings,-1,30,14-Jan-13,"How to rate a restaurant that serves great food which however made us sick later that night?! We went to Waku Ghin last week, the concierge of our hotel highly recommended the place and most people on Trip Advisor liked it very much, so we gave it a try. We had a great evening with really nice food; we recognized most comments previous visitors wrote on TA: too expensive but good. Things went wrong later that night when I found my husband with his head in the toilet pot. The SIN$ 1.100 dinner came back out again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Very good dining experience but not up to expectations,-1,30,2-Dec-12,"The signature dish ""marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar"" is the only memorable dish in the set menu. The other dishes were excellent on the night of our visit, and used first-class ingredients (Alaskan king crab; Tasmanian abalone; lobster; Japanese, not Australian, wagyu steak; etc), but NONE was sublime, the way they should be in a restaurant of this calibre.Great efforts were undertaken to make the experience personal: one chef in charge of each small-ish tepan room; high ratio of waiters to guests; personalised menu. However, the generally excellent service was not without glitches: my companion's glass of still water was refilled with fizzy water, and they charged S$20++ per person for water! I was presented with the credit card and credit card slip of another guest!!!So, overall, an excellent dining experience. But, at US$500 per person (if you have one of the cheapest wines or sakes on the menu, and including service and taxes), it should have been more amazing."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Disappointing, overall.",-1,30,13-Nov-12,"We travelled to Singapore purely to eat here, and although it was good, it was by no means the best dining experience we have ever had, and I felt quite let down after paying the absolutely exorbitant bill. We were prepared to pay, and would not have begrudged one cent of it had it been as good as we hoped, but it simply wasn't. The service was attentive, at some times too much so - having the famously $20 glass of water topped up every time you take a sip was annoying, but for the most part the staff were faultless. I found the atmosphere quite sterile, and I couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer who found the lack of music disconcerting, when conversation lapsed, the silence was profound. And the food ... it was all good, but I simply struggle to remember anything other than the sea urchin which was stunning, and the abalone which was not! I think that says it all, sadly."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Felt ripped off,-1,20,31-Oct-12,"Expensive ingredients cooked up quickly. The chef was concentrating solely on cooking coming across as robotic. During the wagyu course, another chef came in to help but ended up chatting with the chef. It is a collection of elite ingredients such as abalone and lobster prepared simply and displayed pretentiously. The room seats a group of people at the teppan counter and it was simply awkward during the many waiting minutes with no music. Disappointed that water is $20 per person and a sip during dessert left a bitter after taste. It appears that rich businessmen with money to flaunt are the clientele rather than food lovers. Nothing stood out except the price."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Suffered severe food poisoning; no contact from the restaurant,-1,10,18-Aug-12,"I cannot recommend enough that you STAY AWAY from this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday dinner on a Saturday night. In the early hours of the morning after, he began feeling very ill and subsequently was terribly sick for 48 hours. He had to go to the doctor on Monday as we were worried about dehydration, he could keep nothing down. I alerted the restaurant to the problem on the Sunday morning. The only contact number goes through to a central revervation system with a voicemail recording. I left a polite message advising that one of their diners last night had developed food poisoning, and they would probably like to check with both their suppliers and kitchen staff to make sure no-one else suffered. I left my contact details and asked them to call me back. I wanted to know if anyone else was sick that evening. I wasn't even especially angry: food poisoning, while extremely unfortunate, can happen at the best of establishments with seafood and human error. By afternoon I still hadn't heard back from them and I left another polite message. I assumed the line wasn't staffed on a Sunday. I also sent an email as an extra precaution. By mid-morning Monday I'd still not heard back so called again. Again got the voicemail recording, left another message. Sent another email. On Wednesday, I got an email from the restaurant offering us a free dinner. What?! We didn't want or ask for a free dinner; in fact I will never go there again. All we wanted was for someone to care enough about the guest that they had charged over $1,000 and left vomiting for 2 days, having ruined his birthday celebration, to actually call and discuss the situation and make sure it didn't happen to anyone else. I find this absolutely deplorable. To this day I can't read anything about 'celebrity chef' Tetsuya without thinking what a bad person he must be; and what a culture he must be instilling in his staff and restaurants. This review is overdue, but I wasn't reviewing for Tripadvisor at the time it happened. I still want to warn people now. It's not the fact that my husband got food poisoning, as bad as that was; it's the fact that not one person at the restaurant had the courtesy, care, respect or basic professionalism to call for more details and information to hopefully prevent it from happening to any of their other patrons. Dine their at your peril."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore","Good, fresh quality food",-1,30,23-Jul-12,"For the price that we are paying, we are expecting more than just fresh quality food. The few memorable dish we had was the appetizer made with Uni, botan shrimps and good caviar. The combination of salty caviar brings out the sweetness of the uni and shrimps.... divine. The other was the Omi beef from Japan. It is well marbled and grilled slightly plain with a pinch of salt. The taste was sweet and has a pleasant fragrance without the need for any seasoning. The meat was very tender and the fat just melts in the mouth. This is the next best thing to Kobe beef which we can never find outside of Japan. Lastly, the sake that was recommended by the sommelier was excellent. We could not have enough of it. Food wise, it is definitely above the average sushi restaurant but in terms of creativity, is was a tad predictable. The restaurant has a very sombre ambiance and the chef is very serious and quiet. Not a place for playful banter or party unless you book the whole place. It is definitely romantic enough to bring a date to."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",is a meal at this level really only about the food?,-1,20,19-Jul-12,"I have dined at most of the San Pel 50 and was quite looking forward to an innovative experience at Waku Ghin following a glowing review from a fellow foodie, but was a little hesitant given that it was in MBS and thus created to cater to the brash crowd that frequent this destination. I will describe the 4 components that pull a restaurant together seperately. Ambience, Food, Drinks and Service (not in any order of preference)Ambience- Pleasently decorated the segregated dining experience can be a bit of a hit or miss dependent on whom you have as your dining companions. 5 people in a segregated room for 8 courses glued to a Tepan table with the chefs commentary and no music, can mean that the 3 Russian speakers constantly requring explanations about what each ingredient is from a not fully articulate staff could either be a comedy or very cruel torture. For us it was indifferent as we were focussed on not being disturbed, but I can definitely see the downside to this arrangement.Food-Great delivery of some very well cooked if not technically complicated dishes. Given the same quality of ingrediants it would not take a culinary genius to put this together.The Abalone was truly tyre like though and Michelin may well prove to ask this restaurant for some tips on the other side of there business. The beef and lobster were beautiful and the Uni with Caviar and prawns, was very clever combining. Our chef was a plesure. exert s a major let down.Drinks- The wine by the glass selection is weak and the lack of a paired menu disappointing at this level. They tried very hard to up sell and get us to order a bottle of white and red, but as I was the only drinker of the two of us this was never going to happen. I did manage 6 glasses of different wines and the Torbreck was definitely a winner (Well done David Powell again). On the whole a collection of overpriced overly marked up wines aimed at the typical crowd who would be more driven by labels then a sound sommelier who could point you in the right direction. (When I fesiously asked what part of France my desert wine was from, I received a blank look, which was strange as a Sauternes can not b fro any where else) At this level and these prices a little training will not go far a miss.Service - Poor, badly in need of additional training and completely the ultimate let down for this restaurant. The staff generally needed to probably dine in true fine dining establishments, be given lessons in eloquence and understanding of what they are supposed to be doing and then let out on the training floor. This was an unacceptable element of the meal. Lack of knowledge was evident at every turn.Overall- At USD 1000++ for 2 people this was definately poor value. You can only rest on your laurels for so long Mr. Tetsuya. If this left the San Pel List i would imagine it would close in a year."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not as good as I thought it would be...,-1,20,18-Jun-12,"My husband and I were i Singapore for a night before heading to our final destination Australia. My father in law made a reservation for this restaurant for me and my hubby and paid upfront for the menu as a gift for us. The menu was supposed to be tasting menu accompanied with wine for each course. After reading all the great reviews about Tetsuya and how great his restaurants were and after seeing the price of 1000 $ for a 10 course menu I really was expecting something extraordinary before coming to this restaurant. I was so disappointed. We sat down and got offered a glass of water and got served our first appetizer. I immediately thought - were is the wine which was supposed to go with our menu? Their English (believe it or not) was not that good (or did they pretend not to understand?) and it took them a while to see what we asked for. They said they had to check with their colleagues whether or not the wine was ordered!!! So we ended up waiting for them for the whole 15 min with the appetizer in front of us (we didn't know whether we should start eating it or wait for the wine) so that they could check whether or not we had wine ordered. For this much money I would expect the staff to be more professional in their handling of clients. They came back after a while with yet another colleague who, again (did pretend?), did not understand what we asked them about. In the end, after the whole 20 min of back and forth they finally agreed - yes, the wine was offered with your meal when you had purchased it...Wow - no sorry, nothing! So the dinner really started off bad, we had to argue to get what we had ordered, what un unpleasant start to what was supposed to be a high quality dining!In the end, the food was ok but definitely not extraordinary for what you would expect after paying so much money. The only original dish I liked was sea urchin - their signature dish I believe. Also, the waiters were not attentive and you had to wait for them to take plates once you finish a course."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Good but should have been much better,-1,30,10-Jun-12,"We had dinner at Waku Ghin in June 2012. We had the standard 10-course meal together with champagne throughout the meal.The meal started well with an orange-infused tataki of katsuo and the signature appetizer with uni, raw botan ebi and oscietra caviar. Both of these dishes were very good and similar in style and taste to what you would expect at a Nobu restaurant. You cannot get food that is much better than this anywhere in the world so we were in foodie paradise at this stage and expected this to be one of the best meals of our life.Unfortunately, the meal went downhill from this excellent start. We got a very bland and forgettable pan-fried fillet of Ayu followed by an overly rubbery teppan fried abalone served with what tasted like a standard tomato and basil pasta sauce. We suspect that the abalone would have scored higher points with the tyre making division at Michelin than with the firm’s famous restaurant critics. These two dishes were not to our liking and we braced ourselves for what was to follow. Luckily the dinner took a turn for the better with teppan fried lobster and two different beef dishes. These three dishes were all good, and based on premium ingredients, but the dishes were not memorable in any way (luckily we got a copy of the menu together with the bill – otherwise we would have struggled to remember the dishes). At this point, our meal at Waku Ghin felt too much like an ordinary teppanyaki experience. The savoury part of the meal was finished off with a somewhat boring consommé of rice and snapper followed by exclusive gyokuro first-flush tea.After this we transferred from the teppan counter to the dining hall overlooking Marina Bay. We finished off the meal with two forgettable French-style inspired desserts followed by mignardises.In conclusion, this was a good meal and the Osaka-born chef was excellent. However, at this price level we expect a more consistent experience and above all we think that a majority of dishes should be memorable. Sadly this was not the case and I do not think we will return."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Not value for money,-1,20,11-Aug-11,"We were disappointed with this restaurant as we felt it was way overpriced. The two of us shared a room with two business men which meant it wasn't intimate at all. The chef was timid and seemed to be doing his job without showing any real enthusiasm. With exception of the beef and the dessert courses, we felt the tastes were not as good as the Nadaman Japanese at the Shangri-La where we stayed (or any of the restaurants at the Shangri-La). I don't mind paying a high price for food but when I spend S$900 for 2 people (including 1 bottle + 1 glass of wine + sparkling water), I really expect to come out raving about the food. This is the second time we have tried a ""celebrity chef"" without the chef and we been disappointed so we won't make that mistake again."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",overpriced teppanyaki,-1,20,14-Jun-11,"this was essentially a teppanyaki restaurant and you are paying a hefty premium on top of the air freight charges for flying in all the ingredients in from abroad. there is nothing ingenious in the preparation or the taste. It's obvious that tetsuya is trying to capitalize on his fame by charging maximum amount for minimal work. I agree with other reviewers that the lobsters tasted like rubber and the steak was tough. For the price I paid, I expect every dish to be exceptional. This, unfortunately, was not the case. Other than his signature dish of ebi and sea urchin, nothing was memorable. The atmosphere is also very sterile and not to mention no privacy whatsoever as the teppanyaki chef can hear every word you say, so the venue is neither suitable for business entertaining nor a romantic night out."
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Disappointing & outrageous,-1,20,8-Mar-11,"We went in there expecting good food. The attention the staff gave us was outstanding but it was too much attention. Waiting was long. The food preparation was fun to watch . We had maine lobster tasted like rubber, the kobe beef from Australia got over cooked and well done. When we finished the dinner and when we saw the outrageous amount of sgd of 2000/- we almost choked. Felt like the kobe beef was stuck in our throats. Over priced, over cooked over attentive. What a disappointment !!"
Japnese,"Waku Ghin, Singapore",Absolutely no sense of occassion,-1,20,29-Jan-11,"We dined at the restaurant in October 2010, with great expectations. Perhaps I should have taken it as an omen when there appeared to be a question on whether we had a reservation. The night duly arrived and off we set to Waku Ghin. As we were aware the restaurant is in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex..... which is partially opened and devoid of people at 8:30pm.The maitre'd is English and is rather frosty in his greeting. We were shown to the private room which is a teppan grill with seating for 7 people and there we waited and waited and waited for 30 minutes before it was suggested that we may wish to have a drink. We ordered some San Pellagrino and perused the wine list. The wine list is excellent and really show cases Australian wine. It is a shame that the pricing is ridiculous considering the GST and service charge have to be added.Finally after the chef peeking through the door several times and the other guests had arrived, the food preparation begins. There were 2 chefs preparing the food that night and it seems that the chefs do not start until the teppan grill is full which begs the questions why not synchronise the patrons to the same time instead of 3 separate groups arriving over 30 minutes?The several courses duly arrived and whilst the ingredients are the freshest available none of the courses are outstanding in fact some are outright disappointing the abalone for example is tough, the Wagu Beef is a a mere morsel. Pity the poor 15 year old dining with his parents alongside us, he must have been starving at the end of the meal.During the meal one of the waitresses decided to open the sheer curtain to improve the ambience, it was delightful the Chanel neon sign lit up the entire room! She drew the curtain very quickly.In conclusion we paid approximately $S1280.00 for this experince. Both my partner and I felt flat at the conclusion of the evening. Neither of us could believe we had spent such a large amount of money and felt nothing. We have dined in some of the best restaurants in the world and this is the only restauarant where we have experienced an evening such as this."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori dinner,-1,20,16-Oct-18,"Unfortunately we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive for every order we made, and halfway through, the wifi broke, so no one could order through the automated system. They could not cook fast enough for a full house."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",TOO OVERCOOKED BBQ ITEM AND VERY THIRSTY AFTER MEAL,-1,20,8-Oct-18,"This is my first visit and quite disappointed. Food are fresh but BBQ items are mostly too overcooked when served, in the end a bit hard to bite on. I'm not sure if there's too much msg added but after the lunch we drank a lot of water for the whole day."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The people who work there did not seem to like their work.,-1,20,2-Oct-18,"I have been to Shin Minori since 2015. Usually for my birthdays. Or my Father's birthday. The service that was given today (Our dinner timing was 29 September at 7.30pm) compared to the first time we went, it really declined. I also saw that the table beside me on the corner, were complaining that they never got their food. That day there were 6 of us in a group. Our food was also quite slow but it was just how the people served it or approached us, it was cold and just seems like they do not like working there. Sashimi was not as fresh as the last few times I was there. Friends who were there for the first time did compliment that the BBQ / Grilled food were good. I am happy though that the menu still had Sword Fish because that is the only reason that I chose Shin Minori over other sushi place everytime. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",service needs to be better,-1,30,27-Sep-18,Lack of service and food quality is not very good. orders take very long to come as well. waiting staff are not attentive at all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is okay, service quite slow, place is spacious",-1,30,24-Sep-18,"Menu to order was a little confusing at first. Each order you send is literally ""one piece"" - so make sure to order in larger quantities. (All the ""one piece"" orders came much later than the ""larger quantities"" orders.)Sashimi is usually served faster than the yakimono. Sashimi had thick cuts; pretty acceptable. Sushi had lots of rice (not my personal preference). Chawanmushi in different flavours was slightly disappointing - it was the default chawanmushi with sauce/topping on top.Atmosphere was still decent. Place could cater to big groups (I had a table for 8). Overall, still an okay place that is value for money, especially since it's ala carte buffet."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Voucher - Lunch Buffet,-1,20,20-Sep-18,"Went to Shin Minori (UE Square branch) due to the countless advertisements from google and videos. Checked out the price and realized that it is actually really really pricey for a buffet - could get one at the same price for 2 when this is meant for 1 pax - so obviously i was expecting to be of quality because of the value for one. The restaurant looked good and the ambiance was really good for something pretty classy, however, as what i expected was a buffet, it felt kinda weird (since everyone is used to the crowded, noisy, etc).Food has to be ordered through the ipad (which crashed couple times, lol), with not many many varieties for the buffet. and the buffet did not even have free drinks or desert for the price - was shocked as well as pretty taken aback. The food quality was pretty average, and the food serving was very slow - mostly waiting for >30 minutes per item other than the sashimi (cause it should be premade). There was quite many items which was ordered but not served as well. The people who were working at the branch i was in was not very enthusiastic and was not eager to help at all, all of them had a really unhappy look on their face and i naturally did not feel very welcome as well. Just as the buffet was coming to a close, the owner(i presume) - came in and told the chefs to prepare some food (which was the same as we ordered) for a shoot (more advertisements i guess) - and sadly, the presentation of those food was of a completely different standard. Firstly, i did not expect this kind of service or food quality for something of such a high value. And this really isn't going to be compensated with the ambiance of the location. Frankly, i felt that i've wasted my money there and that i could have easily spent the money on something more worth it.This was an utter disappointment. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,-1,30,4-Sep-18,"overall restaurant is not bad, has quite a variety of food. thick slices of sashimis. freshness of food ok."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",$53 National Day promo or not?...,-1,30,2-Sep-18,"Went for above promo. Ordered sake for 2 pax, orange juice for another Pax. Service staff aren’t keen to serve 2 sake bottles, despite the tiny bottle size. Therefore they prefer to waste time running to-and-fro. When we requested for 2 bottles instead of the unnecessary running about, we were told : per table having the same drinks were only entitled to 1 bottle. To the management of shin minori; does the $53 promo means it’s for per Pax or per table?Have better business etiquettes, train your staffs better , to upkeep the service standards. For the template replies of “reduce wastage” , why not , for such future promo , introduce a wastage chargesas well?You are risking negative words of mouth , and a permanent loss of re-visiting customers with such inflexible tiles. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Super bad experience,-1,10,1-Sep-18,Manager bad attutide. Food is not fresh. Service super bad. Its should be a happy day celebrating birthday in the restaurant in the end thanks to shin minori japanese restaurant spoiled everything. This is my first and last time will go .
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food acceptable but bad service,-1,10,31-Aug-18,"Their reception to birthday voucher redemption is kind of unwelcoming.We happened to have 2 good friends whose birthday fall on the same month.So we dated to go out together. Understanding unable to be at same table, we requested fortables side-by-side. They cooked up a liar to say all other tabled fully reserved by customers already and placed our 2 tables far away from one another! Perhaps they are not really magnanimous to offer birthday voucher celebration. They forget the other party is still paying full price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad experience !,-1,10,31-Aug-18,"Seat for 2 are bad, very cram! Stranger next to u will hit u when move the sitting position & elbow. Fried items & their sauce on the food VERY salty! Though serving small portion is ok but not in a small saucer! Really ""Saucer""!! Affect appetite! Have to mention, the Lady Finger, sliced to Very very very thin, serve only 2-3 slices in a ""saucer"" u can't taste what u're eating actually! All other foods too, serve in tiny cube & slice! I thought I went to ""Lilliput""!Overall the experience is BAD!! I really made a wrong choice to go to this place on my Birthday!!!"

As you ordered thru the ipad system, the food arrives about 5 - 7 time.. However after the first hour... The waiting period became longer and longer.. We ordered some dishes like tempura but it never came.. Even after spoke to the Waitress / Supervisor.. She said she tried to check our orders a few times.. But nothing happens.. It was so disappointing.. No one offered any apologies. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Improve service,-1,30,22-Aug-18,"The service of a china girl is not good, the tempura was quite hard and not as nice as the previous time I ate"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good wide ranging spread to satisfy your tastebuds but average quality,-1,30,22-Aug-18,"I love the wide ranging spread that you cannot find from the lower end of the other Japanese buffet. I love some of the maki rolls, Gyuniku Shogayak, Yakimono dishes. Surprised that they do not provide white vinegar for the gyoza. The tuna sashimi is very disappointing for its quality. Staff are friendly and helpful but understaff."

Tan"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below Average,-1,20,17-Aug-18,"On 15 Aug 18 we went to Shin Minori for a birthday celebration and choose their 53th birthday promotion. All the service staff seems clueless of this promotion and NON of them could tell us much about the promotion. The staff can’t even tell whether they are serving house pour or not for the promotion! So naturally we have no idea how the restaurant track 53mins as we were not told. One of the waitress can’t speak English and seems unhappy all the time. Why put her on the floor when she can’t even speak basic English and seems reluctant to be there? Wouldn’t she better off as a food runner or at the bar?There were 3 service staffs and a Manager on duty, the restaurant is NOT full, yet it was so difficult to get their attention for service. Service was slow, lost our orders and we constantly have to get them to refill more sake and beer. Cold Sake was served in a Tokkuri which I thought it’s more appropriate for hot sake and tiny cups. Beer was served in a small rocks glass that most restaurants in Singapore would use it for ice water. The restaurant will only serve us ONE bottle of sake for 4 persons and a beer in rocks glass. I wondered why because they could use bigger glassware and we will take a longer time for refills! It was very annoying for us because we constantly have to wave to get their attention. So I do not understand the rational of them serving drinks in this manner when their staffs have difficulty coping with refilling drinks! Or perhaps this is their ways of limiting our consumption? The staff did not inform us of the last order but simply told us that the promo has ended and we cannot order anymore Sake/beer which I think it’s really unfair. How do we know 53mins has ended? How does the restaurant track the time when they are struggling with service? I approached one of the waitress to clarify on this matter and of course she don’t have any explanation BUT we cannot order the drinks anymore. So I told her to check with the Manager and let us know since she seems unsure. She didn’t come back at all so after 20mins we approached another service staff to get their manager over. She was quite defensive and claims that her staff told us about the last order which she clearly did not. Long story short, eventually she gave us another round – reluctantly and she insisted my friend finished the beer before she serves another one. This is bad customer service! She knows we are annoyed so why aggravate the situation even more? How much will this less than half pint beer cost the restaurant?? Seriously if the restaurant can’t run this promotion properly and thinking of cutting corners, please don’t do it because it is bad for the restaurant and reputation. Our bill came up to $311.90 which is not worthwhile for the entire experience at all. We’ve decided on Shin Minori as most of us had good experience previously and food was good. I can’t say the same for last night, other than the Sashimi the rest of the food were pretty average and nothing great about it. Suffice to say this will be the last time we will be dining at Shin Minori because there are better and nicer Japanese restaurant around UE Square!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An okay dining experience,-1,30,14-Aug-18,"The restaurant was easy to find while the ambiance was rather dated and tired. Staff was attention quick to clear dishes and refresh drinks. The sashimi was fresh and good, so was the maki and yakitori sticks in general. However some of the main dishes were very average and did not inspire us to even finish some of the dishes. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food is so so but very slow in serving, lost our orders several times",-1,10,13-Aug-18,Very hard for us to visit this place another time because our multiple orders at repeated times were lost.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fantastic sashimi,-1,20,8-Aug-18,Sashimi was very fresh and great. Overall food was good. Lunch crowd. We waited an hour for food from kitchen.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lousy service,-1,10,5-Aug-18,"Staff failed to explain the 53th birthday promotion properly, thus shortchanging my dinner party of drink ! When asked politely of them to just fill us up for the last time since miscommunicated, still insisted to stick to the time limit when they were the ones who never made sure we knew of our time limit ! Please train ur wait staff properly . Food wise, nothing to wow about . With the $63/pax price tag ,i could find better food better service elsewhere ."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Lunch,-1,30,5-Aug-18,Food comes in small quantities which was good so that you can try more varieties. However certain items with sauces were too savoury especially the teppanyakis
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but average for the rest,-1,30,29-Jul-18,"Food is ordered by tablet, seems to have inconsistency in arrival time for foods but mostly served quite quickly. Sashimi is served cold and fresh so that was very good. The BBQ skewers were not so good, they were served just a little warmed up. Seating was quite good. Even though it was quite busy, we have good spacing between all tables."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place for Sashimi lovers!,-1,30,28-Jul-18,"We went for the lunch buffet. There was a lot of fresh and delicious Sashimi. Very worth it if you are a Sashimi lover. There are other Japanese food (the usual sushi and handrolls) for those who don't eat Sashimi. When the lunch crowd came, service became quite slow. Our last 2 dishes took about 20min to come."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lousy experience,-1,10,8-Jul-18,"Was there to celebrate my kids birthday.Waitress could not understand english, and chose to ignore us upon seating us at our table.Our orders was missing in the system, asked for the manager, was again ignored.Wonder what kind of training was given to the wait staff, if at first you don't understand the guest, just ignore them?! Saw other tables guest, was waving for wait staff for service, and with visible displeasure as we were.Our bill came up to abt $200.00++, this is not a budget buffer, mind you.Was awarded favorite restaurant by bloggers, that is why we were there.Guess you have to be a blogger in order to get service.First time in my life, have to find food to fill up my stomach after a buffet lunch.Never again, will I step foot into this lousy restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Modrate Japanese Fare,-1,30,26-Jun-18,"Environment of restaurant comfortable and spacious. Staff able to respond for service. However, have seen better quality of Japanese buffet food elsewhere. Although electronic pad is used for making orders, there still seem to be items not being served. Thought that electronic orders would somehow be captured by the chefs and the service staff. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh and nice food,-1,30,26-Jun-18,Food served quite slow. Preferred a detachable iPad menu so to let other diners in the group can place their orders. Sad part was dessert is not included in the buffet. Restaurant quite noisy so not suitable to have serious talk there ;-)
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad,-1,10,19-Jun-18,I’m not going back there again. It costs me 60/pax for poor quality sashimi and sushi!!! So disappointing.....
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service,-1,20,18-Jun-18,Service was so slow. Alot of stuff we ordered did not come. Wait staff had to be reminded to check our order and still they bungled up.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre food and service,-1,20,16-Jun-18,"Went to their Katong Square restaurant on 15th June in the evening for their ala carte buffet. Food was of low quality, especially the sushi dishes. The yakitori items are either too salty or oily and the soup dishes are rather bland. Only the sashimi are worth trying as they tasted rather fresh. Some of the items we ordered were not served and we had to remind and chase the staff for those dishes to be served, even though the restaurant was not overly croweded .Service wise, most of the service staff were relatively polite and prompt in clearing the dishes . The only exception was the male manager of the restuarant, with a heavy malaysian accent and spoke maninly in chinese, was really rude and loud. When we had problem using the ipad gadget during ordering , the manager was standing nearby and thus we gestured to him for help . We were shocked when he walked towards us and raised his voice and asked us rudely in these exact words in chinese ""????“ . He even stared at us as if we did something wrong. We were so taken aback by his rudeness that we were speechless for a while before we continued to ask him how to use the ipad. He did not utter a word and just pressed a few buttons on the ipad and walked off thereafter, leaving us wondering if our order was being placed. Never did we expect to receive such rude and bad service from the restaurant manager. Enough said, the full price (without any promotional discount) that we paid for such mediocre food and service was definitely not worthwhile and this will be our first and last visit."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Terrible service, average food",-1,10,13-May-18,"Went with my family for mother's day meal. And it just ruined the night for us.Firstly, they only offered buffet and not ala carte, which we weren't keen in the first place but since it was a special day, we decided to go ahead.Secondly, the ipad ordering system went down, yet some orders went through (multiple times). So we had to turn away a few repeat orders. But many dishes still didn't arrive. When we asked for an update of what were outstanding about an hour into the meal, the shocking answer was that they couldn't tell and told us to reorder via hardcopy. Then they proceeded to mess up our hardcopy orders. Some items never arrived and even after asking them to check, we waited for 20 mins with no news and updates on our food. By then, all the tables around us had already left and we were still left waiting for our food 2.5 hours after entering the restaurant.We would not have been that upset if the service was not terrible. Some staff was just blur, and one was just plain rude. When we highlighted these issues to the manager, all we got was a feeble and weak explanation. She didnt seem to understand the frustration and kept thinking that the issue was that we had outstanding orders. Service experience aside, the food was not worth it as well. Am never ever going back to Shin Minori again."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Too much sauce with deep-fried items ,-1,30,22-Apr-18,"Went to the branch at Katong Square for the 1 for 1 ala carte buffet offer and was surprised at the stinginess of the cutlery, condiments (no ginger or wasabi on table), lack of plain water (1.80 for free flow hot tea/soft drink) and having to ask for more paper napkins. Ordering from the I - pad was a good idea as photos showed the items though some dishes didn't resemble the pictures eg. the fried asparagus, ebi, rolls inevitably came with a heavy slatherng of teriyaki or some other sauce, so salty and unnecessary that it spoilt the dishes!To be fair, the sashimi was fresh and tasty and the ramen with chicken quite tasty. Portions were appropriate small so diners could try more varieties. However the curry with rice was disappointing as the potatoes were not thoroughly cooked and we had to leave two pieces uneaten, such a waste of food. The pumpkin chawanmushi was unusual though rather too sweet. We wished there were more fresh salad choices as there seemed to be only the fried cabbage dish.Service was fine. Though busy, the wait staff were courteous and obliging.Verdict - only come if you can down endless plates of sashimi or bowls of ramen! Not a quality buffet but fairly priced with the one for one deal. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",No fin with my nori at Shin Minori,-1,20,21-Feb-18,"The buffet menu is long, and encompasses all styles of Japanese cuisine (except shabu shabu). The quality is pretty awful, worse than Sakae Sushi. We tried this out with the Entertainer 1-for-1 offer; otherwise, at $41.90++ per pax it’s not worth it, with such poor quality. Contrary to other reviews, we found the wait time quite good. Service is pro-active. Maybe an acceptable choice for some, but sorry it ain’t us."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Midori,-1,20,16-Feb-18,Food quality was not as good as previous round and waiting time was very long as our orders did not pass through the system and wasn't detected by staff. We had to keep asking and resubmit order again..
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unacceptably Long Waiting Time,-1,20,16-Feb-18,"Although the food was value-for-money, the waiting time for the food was way too long. Furthermore, staff seemed to lack communication and coordination amongst one another. When the food arrived, the number of portions we ordered for each dish were inaccurate, usually giving us a lesser amount than we ordered. Perhaps the system of ordering through an iPad during peak hours could be revised and an alternative method for ordering can be implemented if the kitchen and staff are unable to cope with the overwhelming number of orders being entered in a short period of time. Hopefully this can be improved on ASAP. By doing so, this will naturally improve the restaurant atmosphere. Thanks. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Katong doesn’t consider Yusheng as food,-1,10,13-Feb-18,"Ordered a Yusheng from Shin Minori Katong, when we went to collect we are greeted by a very loud & attitude not so good staff but that’s only the beginning of the bad service.When we asked were the chopsticks already packed? His reply was the most ridiculous & absurd reply we ever heard. His reply was chopsticks are only given for food order, at that moment we were like, you mean Yusheng is not food?!Then he continued he ridiculousness, by saying we don’t normally give chopsticks for Yusheng because all people buy home to eat mah & house sure got chopsticks what. We were speechless by such ignorance assumptions & bad attitude."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible Service From the Manager,-1,10,31-Jan-18,"Horrible service from the waitress and manager.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",the food not fresh,-1,10,7-Jan-18,the fish all is too hard and not fresh. it is weird when you eat the food with hard feeling. Fish is a soft meat. The shashimi is just ok.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food ok , seating terrible",-1,30,7-Jan-18,"Food was ok, the service was average but the seating arrangement for 2pax was terrible. 4 tables of 2 seaters were squeezed tightly together with a Wooden panel to separate but it was claustrophobic in the middle 2 seats coz it’s too close to each other. For the price of the buffet , the seating arrangement was terrible. Felt like fast food joint. Won’t go back again . "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Quite a bad choice for Jap food,-1,10,1-Jan-18,"I went there with my boyfriend for a casual dinner. We tried most of the items on the menu ranging from the sashimi, yakitori, udon and so on, but hardly any dish tasted satisfactory. The yakitori had a sauce on it which was extremely sweet that the dish felt like a dessert. The miso soup was bland. The soup of the kake udon was okayyy but the noodles are too soft, not sure if it is cooked for too long or what. The sushi were also just okay, i personally think places like koh grill and genki have better sushi though.. The lighting of the place is also rather dim, so it kinda brings in the sleepy feel especially after some food. Overall it was not a very nice experience and we didnt really enjoyed it. Its certainly not worth the price. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall bad,-1,10,30-Dec-17,Food was not fresh resulting in us having the runs for 2 days. Service staff was not friendly and had a bit of black face when we asked to top up the drinks. Overall we didnt enjoy the food as much as before. Standard definitely dropped. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Its okay.. not worth the money,-1,30,27-Dec-17,"Paid $72.74 per pax with gst and service charge with green tea. Original price was $59.90++ during this ""festive"" period. Beverages needed to be top up separately. Went on Xmas Eve, restaurant was only 60% full, we were there from 7pm to 9pm. Its an ala-carte buffet, serving speed was ok. Salmon sashimi was quite fresh. Maki has too much rice, hence dont order too much. Yaki dishes, my friends love. Edamame was served hot, strangely. Mentaiko spaghetti was bland, dont try. Zaru soba was soggy, dont try. Chawanmushi was good, try it. Complimentary snow crab served was good. thank you. Good to try on non-festive periods, but still on the pricier side, wont go again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service & food quantity can be improved,-1,30,25-Dec-17,The food quantity is too little per serving then up we must keep ordering and their service of clearing the plates is quite slow but service standards still considered quite okay..
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not too good,-1,20,19-Dec-17,Had the lunch buffet. Fish wasn't very fresh imo and some were slightly sour. Nothing that really stood out frankly quite disappointing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food choices not as great,-1,30,18-Dec-17,"Was here for dinner, I liked that they had a lot of choices for yakitori. But they did lack choices in terms of other cooked foods. Service was fairly good and price is also acceptable, overall experience was still acceptable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese restaurant,-1,30,17-Dec-17,reasonable pricing but space to small for good dining experience. Staff are friendly but they spoke mandarin which not everyone is able to communicate. Although the ordering process is good and high tech but the older customers will find it a challenge trying to use the pad for ordering their dishes. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing,-1,20,16-Dec-17,"This was not my first visit but i was greatly disappointed with the poor service and poor quality of food. The tuna sashimi did not have any taste, the grilled dishes we had, were bad. The quail eggs had a plastic texture, the chicken liver were hard and dry, the chicken skin was just hard and has a burnt smell. The service staff simply placed the plates at the corner of the table, despite space in the middle of table. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Sashimi ,-1,30,9-Dec-17,Sashimi are fresh. Wide variety of choices. Udon & Soba not to expectation. Overall rating is average.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide variety of food but slow service,-1,30,5-Dec-17,"Liked the fact that the variety of food is really wide, but the service is really slow though. Some of our dishes took quite awhile to arrive, while others were forgotten. One came only when we were able to leave."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Little variety available & slow service,-1,20,3-Dec-17,"Went on a weekday lunch and there were only a few other tables occupied. Despite it not being packed, the food was being served slow. Coupled with the little variety available for its buffet, doubt we will return in the near future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money,-1,30,30-Nov-17,Overall food quality is quite good and value for money. However the beef cooked in onion and special sauce has a very strong smell of beef and portion given is too big for 2.Tables for 2 are placed too close to each other so can be very noisy. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet ,-1,30,30-Nov-17,"This is my second time coming here for their Buffet. Food is still as good but I felt that the standard dropped a little. Their food portion became smaller. The maki we ordered used to have grilled cheese on top that made is taste so darn good but right now all they have is the just some sauce drizzled on top of it. Also the yaki tori gizzard that we ordered were so small. It was cut into very tiny pieces unlike before where it’s was much bigger. On a side note, the store fried beef was really good. You have to try that one. Our overall experience was good although our orders took some time to come. Food and service was good. Would give it a 3.5 rating if I could. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Free Birthday treat redemption,-1,30,29-Nov-17,"There’s no free lunch, any Free treat comes with a Min condition- 1 adult Ala Carte buffet lunch excl drink.For ala Carte lunch of $40++ (Tax incl) per pax rate in near town, UE Square, consider ex but value for 2 though with limited public accessibility.We paid for 2 pax with drinks total spent $105+/- for a family of 3 buffet lunch on birthday. So it’s not Free in our context.As the voucher is for all year redemption, so it’s subjective to individual Budget.AC Buffet offers wide spreads, recommended sashimi, chawanmushi, handrolls & teppanyaki/bbq items.Tried most of the recommended on menu, some good some average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",friendly gd service though slow at peak lunch time,-1,30,20-Nov-17,"friendly gd service though slow at peak lunch time. v crowded on a Friday and tables were so close i can see and hear everything the couple said beside us. sashimi was thick and great. tempura were hot and crispy, even the tempura sauce. extensive grilled items menu which was great too.the rice items eg the hand rolls/temaki, sushi, and sushi rolls were not good though. ridiculous amount of rice."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,-1,30,19-Nov-17,"Not the first time come here, reasonable price for japanese buffet. Service is not the best, but food is good"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Will never come here again & neither should you!,-1,10,16-Nov-17,"Decided to visit Shin Minori after reading raving reviews online.Firstly the food was substandard.Nothing like the impressions I read from other reviews.Worst of all, I was denied a credit card promotion just because the staff said so.Terms and conditions on their website wasn’t clearly written resulting in great ambiguity."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",You pay for what you get.. ,-1,30,11-Nov-17,"For the affordable prices, you get average quality food and below average service levels.
Also, the place looks like it needs a revamp badly.
Not a place for serious lovers of Japanese cuisine.. read connoisseurs."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So So...,-1,30,10-Nov-17,"Food was average, service was less than average. Tori skewer was cannot make it at all.. taste dry and not much of flavouring."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Overall not bad,-1,30,9-Nov-17,"Food was not bad, but sashimi could have been fresher. Grilled dishes were very salty, so was the agedashi tofu. Worth it given the birthday voucher but if not for it then probably not. iPad ordering is good but can include a page on the outcome of the food i.e. an ordered list, cooking/preparing list and then a served list so that customers know what dishes has arrived, what they have ordered and hasn't arrived and what dishes they are eating. iPad also better to be held, not clamped to table as it was quite hard to maneuver. But overall not bad, service good too. Would go again if there's similar discount/1-1."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor experience @ Shin Minori,-1,20,6-Nov-17,"The ambience of the restaurant was reasonable. Service was slow to response and the AI ordering system was not friendly at all. The touch Pad home button was poorly fitted into a metal housing hole which was poorly done and needed really very small fingers to access. Food quality was good but slow to be served after the ordering. My overall experience was average for the restaurant, compensating was the waitress who was very helpful to take photos for us. If you want to be good, you must look into the touch Pads and the holding structures. AI Technology should enhance the ordering experience and not to turn guest away. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Staff Service & Food portion at UE Square,-1,30,2-Nov-17,The foods are delicious but portion of the food for each order for the ala carte buffet is too small. The staffs are not proactive to provide spoons & wasabi when soup and sushi are served. Have to ask for wasabi twice before it was served.Servers are chinese speaking. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Bold claims but only good, not great.",-1,30,31-Oct-17,"We had a family dinner for 7 at their Katong Square outlet. Selection was decent enough and the sashimi was nice. Not what I would consider “great japanese ala-carte buffet” cos we’ve had better. Perhaps a sign of this was a really small number of tables were occupied tonight. Perhaps they make up during weekends. Sashimi was nice but not the best based on price. Tempura was nice but a bit on the oily side and batter wasn’t light enough. Pasta was sticking and clumping up. Grilled selection was either bland, which I’m ok with since I appreciate natural flavours but the sauce for some grilled selection like chicken liver was way too salty. Wasabi wasn’t evenly fresh with some bits with a lil kick but mostly bland. Grilled pork with garlic had an overkill of garlic to the point where it drowned out the flavour of the pork. All in all, good for a one time visit but I won’t be going back anytime soon. Good but not great. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi Lover's Heaven,-1,30,30-Oct-17,"The restaurant serve a huge range of fresh and premium sashimi. It's delicious! Food were served hot. However, agemono dishes were disappointing, batter was too thick."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Gd for casual dining,-1,30,28-Oct-17,"Service and food was a little slow as the restaurant was quite busy, but food was ok. There was a good variety of food. And love the snow crab soup. Jus remember to print out the voucher."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not impressed with food. Poor service.,-1,20,13-Oct-17,"Utilised the birthday voucher, and tried it out for the first time. Not impressed with food but worse is the service. The sushi rice vinegar was too overloaded. The yakitori items were overcooked. Finally the service was very the ????Its ok because we will not be patronising again even if there is free dining for both. In addition, first time using Chope Reservation and the number 68714254 kept calling me to confirm despite me having confirmed after reservation, then 15 mins before reservation and then after being in restaurant for 30 mins already. It auto called me back when I ended the call and in the end, I had to block the number. Will steer clear of Chope Reservation in the future."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Feeling so sad with the order and staff,-1,20,8-Oct-17,"At 1st we request to chance sit, but staff ingrone us2nd the taplet when we use for place order always connect error 3rd the food that we order never come staff still blame that is we never place order. Any way this is 3rd time I go, but the service become worse and worse... "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great selection of food.,-1,30,3-Oct-17,There was a great selection of food but I didn’t not manage to try them all. Those that I tried taste pretty good but the staffs seems a bit short handed.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it,-1,30,2-Oct-17,"The dishes are terrible, does not match the pictures. Also the addition of random sauces on the various dishes spoil the taste. Portions are always inconsistent."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",AT $41.90++ PER PAX FOR DINNER YET NO FREE WATER!,-1,30,2-Oct-17,"This review has a good rating.I must have visited at least 6 times in the last couple of years. In awe for the first few visits but not last night. My son’s second visit and he said he will return. Perhaps my expectations were higher or I didn’t enjoy any ambience there. There was none to mention. Sashimi especially the salmon, yellow tail and sword fish were fresh. Some maki and skewers were good. But a couple of dishes were very salty. Service was lacking. The vegetables tempura was the first few items my son ordered and did not arrive until the end of our dinner. We had to remind them at least 5 times because each time we were told another 2 or 3 minutes.It is already quite pricey and yet water is chargeable at 80 cents and green tea at $1.90. I can’t. Personally, I won’t go back but if my son wanted to, I will go with him. And I didn’t even take any pictures last night."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch on Sunday,-1,30,27-Sep-17,Crowded. Food is average. Some food not cook in Japanese way like quail egg. They fried it before grill. The cold dish sour plum cucumber..they did not use Japanese cucumber so the taste was weird. 1 order paper was tucked under 1pc of our salmon teriyaki. Is not a hygiene way of serving. My Japanese friends are not impressed. I was shocked too. The order tablet hang at least 3 times and created double order. We showed the staff we had already finished our food but the service staff kept showing us 2 orders of same food. We thought is our mistake so we accepted it. The 3rd times it happened we spoke to someone higher and he was more understanding and removed the extra food we did not order. Is my first time at Shin Minori and is a little disappointing experience for a Japanese Restaurant. I may try again if they improve on food quality and hygiene standard.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Water bottle full of mold,-1,30,25-Sep-17,"We've dined in this restaurants regularly for a few years. The food quality is pretty consistent throughout. However, I must say the service is not as good as before and the sitting space is getting smaller and smaller. In our last visit to Shin Minori last weekend, the water bottle that they gave us with the ice water is full of mold! No kidding, I wish i could post a photo here....tsk tsk"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide spread of ala carte buffet,-1,30,21-Sep-17,"There were many choices to choose from if someone like variety. However, I find the sushi is average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,-1,30,20-Sep-17,"Food was average but decent for the price. However, we faced a lot of technical difficulties during ordering. Our ipad failed like five times and had to ask for assistance. That certainly affected our dining experience as we had to resubmit all our orders."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible experience,-1,10,17-Sep-17,"I will never go back to this restaurant. Stated 80 cents for cold water and free refill. Ordered one for son's girlfriend cos my son and i are not in the habit of drinking water while eating. Refill was good until when the crowd came in. Asked to refill, manager came to tell me that it's the restaurant's policy for customer to order the no. of water accdg to the no.of pax. Tried to see their fine prints but couldn't find. Felt insulted tat he's implying we shared, saving$1.60 after having tho pay close to$150 for the meal. So we told them no need to refill. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Family dinner cum birthday celebration,-1,30,17-Sep-17,"We booked this place through Chope to celebrate our second kid's birthday. Trying out for the first time. We end there at 630pm Sat (it was also the F1 weekend) It was quite crowded by the time we went there and full house by around 7 plus. Every one there went for the buffet. Order system was via the ipad/samsung tab. Our food was served after that.Servings was generally small portions to very small portions - more like for one person servings. We thought it was fine as this will help to minimize wastage.There was 5 of us, so when our initial order was served, we quickly adjusted and order more servings for each item. Overall the food and experience was just average. The staff and service was ok. For us, the most important was that the family had a good time and the birthday kid liked the meal treat. It was memorable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very bad atmosphere,-1,30,11-Sep-17,"Very unlucky that the next table is a group of ladies who talk loudly.
It was really terrible and they really ruined the great atmosphere!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Chope is AWESOME, Shin Midori used to be too...",-1,30,11-Sep-17,"Food was alright. Service got messy due to crowd. Many disruption for wifi digital food ordering too. Avoid going on Fridays especially if you want to be having a peaceful, comfortable and enjoyable get together. Loud noisy big groups made the place so rowdy and noisy that you can hardly even hear yourself. Popularity equates to such I guess. Quite turning off. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was average,-1,30,3-Sep-17,"The food was alright, not terribly impressive or yummy. Had been hoping to get the birthday free buffet but unfortunately, we were told we couldn't get it on public holidays. That wasn't stated in the birthday treat page. What's more, that day itself was my husband's birthday! All orders were done via an ipad — would have been nice to be able to key in special requests in there. They had the option to select but could not key in anything, so as good as not having."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet,-1,30,3-Sep-17,"Food is average and eat all you like but not fantastic but still overall is ok. Will i go again, well maybe."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not so good,-1,30,2-Sep-17,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. As usual, the sashimi were fresh. But the grill is not so good, either it's over cooked or too dry. It might be due to the crowded as the restaurant was packed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebration,-1,20,1-Sep-17,"I have recently visited another japanese buffet lunch with similar price, Shin Minori can't compete in the following areas : food quality, food quantity, menu display (does not show actually serving quantity)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food was good but disappointed overall.,-1,30,31-Aug-17,"I picked this restaurant to have my birthday lunch as it had a birthday promo for the lunch a-la-carte buffet. Prior that day I had signed up and received a voucher which I didn't know had to be screenshotted (they did not send a copy to my email). The day before I was due for lunch, I looked in my email for a copy of the voucher but it wasn't there so so tried to apply for it again. And when I did, the website prompted me that I have already been registered. To cut the Long story short, when I explained to the staff about the mix-up, he deliberately just told me that there was nothing I could do about it. Which was a rather weak attempt at service recovery, in my opinion. I considered walking out (I had not ordered yet) but still decided to give the place a shot. I paid for 2 buffets with 2 bottles of sake and was satisfied with the meal however, it was one of the lower moments on my birthday. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",average food,-1,30,28-Aug-17,"average food. would rather visit hokkaido sushi at hotel M for the same price but definitely better standard. service was great, dishes were served quickly without having to wait for long and empty plates were cleared promptly as well."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so only.,-1,30,28-Aug-17,"Food was ok, not worth for kids unless your kid can eat. 5 years and above is already chargeable which was not much cheaper than adult price. No kids menu."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese buffet!,-1,30,26-Aug-17,"Theres an electronic system for you to order your food and you can see pictures of various different food, however the system is quite slow and clashed a few times. Some of our orders did not come despite several reminders from us."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,-1,30,23-Aug-17,Food variety not as much compared to other ala carte buffet. Quality of food are ok but not the quantity.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so buffet,-1,30,23-Aug-17,General impression was not bad. Do not order the kimichi dishes as it tasted weird. Drinks are charged separately.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Super bad experience,-1,10,19-Aug-17,The female supervisor service is very unprofessional. Show black face & very rude. I don't understand how can such a person can work in a Japanese Restaurant & in a supervisor role.

Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not bad,-1,30,12-Aug-17,Quite good service not bad and good served fast. Just that no drinks provided and also our seats were not conducive
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Awful Experience !,-1,10,10-Aug-17,"This is by far one of the WORST Japanese restaurant !Food served was extremely salty ! Food is marinate with salt ONLY ! ( If you love salty food ! go for it )Raw fish served has a fishy smell as compare to others.Staff service was worst - don't expect a smile from any staff. ( If they ever smile at you , CONGRATS ! you are really lucky)"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review,-1,30,5-Aug-17,"The resturant was quite crowded, i believed it is because of its jap buffet offering. The sashimi was good, but the rest of them was average or below average, especially the yakitori, the sauce is very bad and cold. The green tea is blant, service was ok"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Rude, Sarcastic and Self ordering app that kept crashing ",-1,10,2-Aug-17,Cashier was poor in explaining use of Entertainer App and misled us to purchase the app usage instead of voucher for buffet. Subsequently accused us of non payment while being rude and sarcastic. Self ordering app in iPad kept crashing and we waited in vain for food that did not turn up. Reorders were made but not all the food arrived. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unpleasant experience at Shin Minori,-1,20,2-Aug-17,"The service was bad - preferential treatment for those having the ala carte buffet. When my family and Indonesian family friends were there last weekend, we were advised after being seated that our food would arrive in 20-30 min because they will service those going for the ala carte buffet first. As we were using the Entertainer app, they told us that the free items would be the chawanmushi after seeing that we had ordered it. We then asked whether we could cancel the orders since it had only been a few minutes since we ordered. However, we were informed that it was too late because the chawanmushi had already been prepared and was about to be served to us. The chawanmushi for ala carte buffet goers is different because our chawanmushi contained a prawn. As such, I would not recommend going to this restaurant unless you want to go for their ala carte buffet. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Arrogant Attitude of Hostess,-1,20,30-Jul-17,The attitude of hostess was arrogant. I think that's because the business was too good. There's no personnel touch nor smile from her.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Deteriorated,-1,20,30-Jul-17,I've come here before. This time the sashimi was thin and wasn't presented as well. The skewers were a letdown - dry and lacking flavour. My only comfort is that we were using half-off vouchers
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",decent variety of japanese style food but could be a better experience,-1,30,29-Jul-17,"the place looks a bit crammed because of the way they arrange the tables and seats. order via tablet (which crashed a couple of times). sometimes they miss a few items in the order. called for service (via the tablet) but no staff came over. slowly in clearing dishes. sashimi quite fresh. other hot items are quite average. some came piping hot, some came a little cold. noisy on a weekday afternoon. stated last order at 2.15pm but staff came to remind us last order at 1.55pm."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service + staff very inflexible on birthday voucher,-1,20,29-Jul-17,I brought my gf to this place for her birthday. There was a one-for-one promotion for birthday month. Staff say we need voucher which needs to be done online. We asked if we can do on the spot. They were very inflexible on that.. the food took a long time to serve as well.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Avg Jap Restaurant,-1,30,25-Jul-17,"Sashimi was really thick n fresh the first time, but far inferior in the subsequent round. Not properly defrosted, so the bite is not crunchy n fresh, but rather breaks apart n slightly mushy. The carbs are also quite badly done, turning dry n tough from the microwave reheating. The sushi n rolls are nice though."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fast service but average food-wise,-1,30,25-Jul-17,"Service was extremely fast and servings were small, which was good as you can try as many food items as possible. However, apart from the fresh sashimi, the other food items were only average tasting in my opinion. Buffet does not come with complimentary water nor desserts"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A night at Shin Minori,-1,30,23-Jul-17,"I went with my wife for dinner at 21 July 2017 using the reservation service from Chope. This was our second visit to the restaurant for this year.1. Service was average to slightly above average. The restaurant was busy but staff were responsive. Most of the staff don't look too happy, except for the filipino waitress who was serving our area.2. Food was below average in general. Salmon sashimi was good as usual. Sushi was one of the winners, although I felt that the rice portion could have been reduced by 50%. The swordfish sashimi was not palatable - yes, this was the same as our first visit. Swordfish/Mekajiki is one of my favourite, hence I ordered it again, hoping that it would somehow it would be better this round - sigh! All other dishes were below average.3. Ambience - you almost have to be shouting to have a conversation. So don't expect too much.We had wanted to use our Entertainer app, but only realised that it was for lunch buffet when we arrived. Hence, we paid over $100 for 2 pax for the dinner.For this amount of money, I definitely can find something better. I suggest to go this place only if you are big fan of sushi, salmon sashimi and only if you have a 1 for 1 promotion coupon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Crowded during weekday lunch,-1,30,23-Jul-17,The restaurant seemed to be overwhelmed by the ala carte buffet's orders which came slow and understaff too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only for the Sashimi,-1,30,22-Jul-17,Originally intended to use the entertainer app during dinner hours but soon realised that the menu they offered are geared more for buffet. The Ala carte serving was too little to justify the app. Buffet was so so. Bland for most. Here for the sashimi.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",MUCH ABOUT NOT TOO MUCH !,-1,30,21-Jul-17,"I chose to dine at Shin Minori after reading an online review.The ambience was average and the seating cramp.Staff were well mannered but not too helpful. The supervisor (maybe captain or manager) made sure we knew her status because when I asked her for assistance, she would delegate a waiter or waitress to respond to me instead.The first 3 plates of sashimi were fresh but after that it was soft and warm.Other dishes were mostly served singular and in extremely small portions. It was frustrating to see the food served in this manner. They were like children's masak masak dishes! However, must say the salad was impressive... crisp and tasty dressing!My daughter had a cake after dinner and said it was small in portion and tasted below average.After our visit, my family members said it wasn't value for money and they'd prefer to eat elsewhere.    "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't feel welcomed.,-1,10,15-Jul-17,". i had been to this restaurant 2 times & I always had a good impression. But this time round I simply feel like I am not welcomed. i had made reservation for 1.30pm. last order is at 2pm, & closes at 2.30pm. when I reach at 1.45pm, your staff said last order in 8mins? Ok fine, I agreed & walked in with the lady. While the lady was showing me to the table, she commented ""why can't you come another day? "" ""why don't I come another day""? Fine I won't come again. The price of your buffet is not cheap & this is the kind of customer service you are giving. Please reflect on your service. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Had better Japanese food,-1,30,10-Jul-17,Booked a table for 2 on a Friday night. Food choice was alright with a mix of sashimi / sushi and yakitori / grilled items. Generally portions were ok but food quality was really average. The sashimi didnt taste particularly fresh and it was hard to finish some of the items.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,-1,30,5-Jul-17,"Extensive selection available for the buffet lunch. Can try lots of items as single serving is usually one pc. Sashimi are fresh. Overall food are not bad. Do note that the buffet does not include drinks. However, the attitude of the waitresses and waiters, especially one of the waitresses, really need lots of improvement. When I told one waitress that they gave me a bowl of rice which i didn't order, she keeps repeating its ""Gohan"" and insisted that i had ordered it before turning her back and walk away. I need to get their attention again (as i really do not want to eat a bowl of rice!) and this particular waitress walk to my table with her sullen face, upon checking my order list, realized that she had made a mistake, just took the rice away, turn her back and walk off without apologizing. Plain rude!!! In fact they had orders mixed up several time. Most of the time, the waitresses and waiters are standing there talking loudly without any regards to the customers around them."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow service,-1,20,5-Jul-17,"Waited very long for food to be served. Slow service the moment it got crowded. Had to cancel all remaining orders as the wait was too long! Sat at a corner with wooden panels as surrounding, the wooden panels were mouldy and dirty."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch at Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant ar UE,-1,10,3-Jul-17,"I patronised this restaurant on 28th May Sunday together with four of my friends for lunch buffet. It was our 1st visit, the experience is bad. Waiter & waitress include cashier ' atttiude is terrible. No customer's sense. It is not that they are shortage of staff, they simply has no initiative, no customer's focus.We have to request several times to refill our cups. We have to walk to counter to pay the bill & queue while the waiter & cashier continue with their chit chatting. After payment, no acknowledgement no thank you. Never expect such lousy service & attitude in this Japanese restaurant, no matter how goood the food is, poor service will put customer off. The past rating of excellence is in the past. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Rush,-1,20,28-Jun-17,"the shop closes at 10pm, last order at 9.30pm. we made reservation for 8.15pm which is the earliest time slot possible for online booking so not left much time to really enjoy (we ordered the buffet btw, this is BEFORE they told us the last order time). everything was frantic and rushing to order as much as we could then at 9.45pm they started to shut down everything. Although they didn't tell us to leave but we got the idea. Its one of the worst experience we ever had in this type of restaurant. about half of the choices of sashimi has a bit of sour taste, might be due to exposed to room temperature for too long, all the cooked food was covered in MSG, u WILL get very thirsty and have to BUY more drinks even if u are having buffet (yes, it's pathetic, its supposed to be all u can eat but not all u can drink, even tea is not FOC). Do NOT come here no matter what."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Taste of food and the service provided,-1,10,27-Jun-17,"Variety of food - satisfactoryTaste of food - below averageCustomer service - horrendousThe waiters and waitresses were making loud and weird noises, like woofing or barking noises. And we closed the tatami room doors and they opened it again and showed us black face. Like they are very frustrated as they have to wait for us to finish our food. They have to get this right - it's a buffet!!!!!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",What you get is what you pay for,-1,30,27-Jun-17,"The cuts can be better. The taste is average. It was quiet on a Saturday during lunch time, so this is not a bad place to bring children."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet,-1,30,26-Jun-17,"Decent food but not the most memorable japanese buffet in Singapore. The portion sizes for the hot food were huge, which was rather odd given that this is an ala carte buffet. Service was extremely quick and waitresses were generally very helpful."

Service not to standard. Overall, disappointment for my friends and I."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The ambience is good but the people working these were busy chatting among themselves. Service was below expectation.,-1,20,24-Jun-17,"Even the Chef preparing food there were chatting away without any mask on, hence is rather unhygienic? Was there a few years back , the service was far better than now."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice sashimi,-1,30,21-Jun-17,"I read a review on this restaurant so naturally I had my expectations/hopes up. The sashimi was nice and fresh but the items fell below expectation. Thankfully I had the birthday voucher, otherwise I would feel it was not worth the money per pax. I was given a $10 voucher for the next visit but I doubt I will return."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good spread variety,-1,30,20-Jun-17,The variety is huge with good range of raw and cooked food. Overall the quality of food is quite good. However I was disappointed the buffet does not come with drink and dessert.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Was slight disappointed,-1,30,16-Jun-17,"Went there with friends for a birthday celebration, had high expectations as we read some good reviews and it was our first time there. The food was average, some of the sashimi were cut into uneven thickness, the fish also wasn't very fresh. The service was slow but understandable as the place was filled. Price is abit steep for the quality of service and food that was provided."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Surprisingly good sashimi,-1,30,15-Jun-17,Good sashimi quality for the price but that's it. Everything else was average. So just order the sashimi if that's your thing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A pretty big disappointment,-1,20,14-Jun-17,"I was very disappointed at the very least. Fresh sashimi was what attracted me to the buffet but it certainly wasn't very fresh. The tuna was fishy and the other sashimi was average at best. The cooked food and grilled items, I didn't even order twice and I usually really love grilled items. The best items were the chawanmushi (very silky) and the mini soft shell crabs. Went there on a 1 for 1 special deal but wouldn't go for a similar offer."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre food,-1,30,9-Jun-17,Mediocre food but there was birthday month promotion. It costs about 50++ for 2 person with the promotion. They charge for green tea separately too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Recent visit,-1,30,3-Jun-17,"The tablet to order food keep hanging a few times. Thankfully the waiter agree to take our order. When I rang to book, they told me there still 1-1 promotion for lunch using UOB. I wrote remarks on my online booking after my call, they should call me to explain if the promotion has ended before the actual dining date. We ended up paying for 4, 1 free. Promotions should be listed on website so it's clear. A bit disappointed "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Non alcoholic drinks chargeable and no dessert,-1,30,3-Jun-17,All drinks are chargeable includes non alcoholic drinks and there is no dessert or fruits too. Ika sashimi cut too thick.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,-1,30,2-Jun-17,food is average and seafood is not very fresh. Staff were friendly though and the general ambiance is cozy.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",food was so so,-1,20,31-May-17,"Went on my actual birthday, because they have birthday offer with min 2 person going. We went for lunch buffet, with sashimi, yakitori, soup, side dishes, and rice noodles. Their portion is very very small, and a bit salty for yakitori. Expect for salmon sashimi, I don't think anything that I've ordered was nice. Ended up, my friend paid more than 40 for that meal, even they gave us a 10 dollar voucher, but I will never want to visit this restaurant again for below average food. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,-1,30,28-May-17,The food standard dropped since the last we went last year. The service of the staff was also not up to standard.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Great place for kids,-1,30,24-May-17,"I was not blown away by this place... but it was convenient and close to our hotel...
It was fine as a fast and good solution..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not up to expectations,-1,20,24-May-17,"Inflexible iPad ordering device, difficult to use because it was fixed on to the wall. No wifi - although the signal is strong but it was not available to diners. Sashimi was not fresh, just edible. other dishes are mostly average in taste. Tight table arrangements. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Hungry and angry,-1,10,23-May-17,"Came around 9pm with 2 friends and started to order a few dishes. We knew we could order more later so we didn't order too much. And around 9:30pm a waiter came to us to tell us it was time to make the last order. So we did and order all what we expected to eat at once. Dishes started to come and then it stopped. So we asked the waiter where were the pending items. He replied that there was nothing else. We ended up with a bill of 150 sgd for 3 (no drinks) for 5 makis/sushis each. Well, that makes the most expensive sushi I ever had..The worst is that they asked us to pay before we discovered that they cancelled most of our order. And there was no refund possible - even if one of my friend had only one miso soup. The manager even told me that I will have a rebate next time but she didn't even write my name - that's just cynicism.About the food, don't expect too much. It's a Buffet so you won't get the best fish nor the best part of it. They were out of stock of their premium fatty salmon. The sashimis slices were so thick that they were hardly eatable.Definitely one of my worst sushi experience in Singapore."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service needs improvements,-1,30,22-May-17,"Food was good. only thing was the service. the staffs took a few wrong orders from our table without telling us. And I realized when we ordered something from the staffs, they don't reply anything... zzzzzzz"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Cooked salmon was not fresh,-1,20,21-May-17,"We went there on a fri night, restaurant was busy and they were probably under staffed. Variety and sashimi was ok. I also had the cooked salmon with egg gravy, which my friend tried a little- she did mention it tasted not fresh but I ate it all. 30mins after we left, I vomited out all the cooked salmon and eggs. Imo, the raw stuff are ok.. but the meat they use for their cooked food varieties might not be that fresh (they might feel they are cooking it anyway to kill the bateria) Bad first experience and wil not go back."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nothing fantastic ,-1,30,18-May-17,"I suppose it's attempting to follow a very autonomous serving idea, but we prefer a little more service. Walking into the restaurant, a server motioned us over to a table, we sat down and didn't get a single acknowledgment afterwards. All food and drinks were ordered on an iPad, and once prepared, dropped off without a word again. Food was decent, but not enough to make me want to go back."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service,-1,30,18-May-17,Staffs do not bother to welcome us to the restaurant and even when we are leaving after making the payment. Their service is really bad.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi and various Japanese food,-1,30,18-May-17,"Sashimi was great! We ordered three plates by the end of our dinner. Various other items ok - cold ramen, edamame, sushi, chawinmushi. Service was quick. It's quite pricey for an average place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unsatisfied Dining Exoerience,-1,10,16-May-17,Food is too salty!! Food ordering system is slow. Service is slow! Location isn't ideal although parking is easy!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,-1,20,15-May-17,"Food was not as good, service as well... My whole family wasnt expected it to be like this and they are very unsatisfying with it... Funny thing was: if the restaurant's last order was 2pm... den it should inform us earlier when we booked or stated at the website or voucher... so that we will not book the timing for 2pm... "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Consistent,-1,30,14-May-17,"Back after many years, quality and standard remains consistent. Good value for money with decent diverse selection. Service was below par (many wait staff were unable to speak English)."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,-1,30,12-May-17,"Did not have very high expectation for this place due to all the bad reviews that I have came across. However, after dining there, realized it's not that bad? Service was ok, food was good. Value for money actually."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Experience at restaurant,-1,30,10-May-17,Chope was easy to use but the food is normal tasting only. Ambience is okay but the table is abit small to put all buffet stuff
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Below average quality,-1,20,7-May-17,"I booked dinner and paid about $106 for Jap buffet for 2pax. Firstly service was quite slow, given the fully packed restaurant. The cooked food was very average, and we didn't order more than we usually would have. The portions of cooked food was a little off, some came in just one piece, but some was too big a portion even for 2 pax, just like the kimichi bean sprouts dish. The sashimi was thickly sliced and seemed to be out of the fridge for awhile. But to be fair, it wasn't not fresh, but definitely not my idea of fresh sashimi just out from the fridge. We had 2 wrong orders given amidst the overwhelming crowd. Overall okay experience, but will not return for awhile. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Pretty Average Food,-1,30,2-May-17,"Went there with great expectations after seeing the place win some awards on reservation sites, went away feeling underwhelmed.Many of the dishes tried were average at best, and lack even the closeness to japanese food flavours one can regularly find at places like Keyaki, or even at Chako and Hakata (previously at Hong Leong Gardens).For eg. Chicken teppan came pretty hard to chew and had a gooey sweet taste to it, which was quite odd; Ebi tempura came rather limp and bland while the accompanying dip was tasteless, unlike the very light but aromatic dip, one usually would expect. Gyuniku Shogayaki was good, though the flavour resembles more a cze char dish than a japanese itamemonoThe sashimi were good, clean and fresh tasting, so are the sushi and temaki. Well-made, standard fares, so those would be the standouts in the restaurant.Entertainer app can be used for PH eve, however some of the staff were unaware of this, but eventually the correct processing was done, so customer may need to be more in tune with the promotions on offer instead of relying only on the service crew.Pretty packed on a noisy Saturday afternoon, so no ambience to speak of.For the sheer variety, the price is very decent at $40++"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi day!,-1,30,2-May-17,Nothing spectacular especially the drinks pricing make up for the discounts they give for the foods.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible attitudes,-1,10,2-May-17,"Horrible attitudes of staff and even the branch manager. Refused to let us change table even though 90% of the tables were not used for the rest of the evening. When asked what buffet includes, service staff says ""Everything"" but in fact it only includes what is listed under buffet tab. when asking the female branch manager(?) questions, she wasn't even facing us when she answered, and worse, answered in an agitated tone. Honestly worst experience ever in a restaurant. Felt like a kopitiam standard."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,-1,30,1-May-17,"Second time visiting the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff was very busy during the lunch buffet and did not manage to attend to us calling them for help. It took a while for the staff to respond. Otherwise, the food was of reasonable quality for the price paid and it had a good ambience as well. Will consider returning to this place."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,-1,30,1-May-17,Good service. Food selection was average. Sashimi quality wasn't very good. The cold Soba was tasteless.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Expensive, slow service, and poor quality of food",-1,10,30-Apr-17,"The price is overly pricey for the quality of food they serve. On top of that, even though it's a buffet, you got to wait for them to serve you. Waiting time for the dishes is very very long. For $40 per pax, it's really not worth your money and time visiting this place. This is an honest review. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Affordable buffet,-1,30,24-Apr-17,"We (family/relatives) decided to try this place out for my birthday. Since we had 10 or 11 people, they gave us a private room. Since this was an ala carte buffet, ordering was done through a tablet. We had to ask for another tablet as 11 people sharing 1 tablet was just ridiculous. Drinks are not included in the buffet, so take note. Service was quite slow. Some of the items we ordered took more than 30 minutes to arrive!Though the buffet was extremely affordable (considering it was serving Japanese cuisine and it was a dinner buffet), the quality of the dishes were not up to standard. The sashimi was relatively fresh. The salmon handroll I ordered was pathetic, there was only a small piece of salmon inside the handroll. (as shown in the photo) The spring rolls were super thin.Overall, I would not recommend coming here if you are picky about the quality of food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant - April 2017 visit,-1,30,24-Apr-17,"Food was ok. But there was a big group of student booking making the place like market area, my friends and I cannot even talk or hear clearly."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't go. Period.,-1,10,18-Apr-17,"Bad food, bad service, terrible coordination between delivery orders and live orders. Waiters did not speak English."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Lunch,-1,30,14-Apr-17,"Drinks not inclusive, per pax is $45 after all the miscellaneous charges, not worth for the limited variety of food choices available for buffet. Food not as fantastic as reviewed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Missing food,-1,30,9-Apr-17,Food was not bad but some of our orders didn't come. The waiter also mixed up our orders with the table beside. We had to exchange our food after relizing our food went to next table and theirs are on our table. The place is quite cramp. Wouldn't come back if there's no promo as it's quite pricey. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh swordfish,-1,30,9-Apr-17,"For sashimi, the swordfish and salmon were good. The cuts were too thick. The tuna was inedible cos it was about an inch thick. Rest of menu was okay. The tempura batter a bit thick."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CAN BE BETTER,-1,30,3-Apr-17,"Celebrated my friend birthday there last week. The birthday girl commented the 1st & 2nd batch of sashimi served is with different quality and she is quite dissappointed. Seated near to the live kitchen so the conversation, giggling and comments between kitchen & service staff can be annoying and disturbing. Overall, the whole experience is still good and i look forward to see more improvement in future..... so GAMBATTE!!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth the money,-1,20,2-Apr-17,"Went there with birthday 1for1 promo. Since it's ala-cart buffet, we need to wait till they serve us our order. Table was too small, orders came in quite slow, plates were not cleared until we asked them to. The food quality was not bad, but it's only worth it because it's 1-for-1. for full price $44, will never go back again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average Food, Bad Service, Not value for money",-1,10,1-Apr-17,"Bad service: Food took an extremely long time to arrive on our table for the very little amount of food we have ordered. When we need someone to attend to us to refill our tea pot, we have to press more than 6 times on the tablet and no one attended to us. We have to go to the service staff directly (none was around our section) to get it refilled. Food: Sashimi was fresh and good. Yakitori are too hard/tough for comfortable chewing. The serving were miserable. We ordered bacon wrapped with asparagus and the serving is so small. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Sashimi Quality but super slow service,-1,30,31-Mar-17,"Food service was slow. Had to do multiple reminders to service staff for my hand rolls but it wasn't served at all. On the bright side, Sashimi cut was fresh and thick. Their grilled spread was good. Their crab croquette was nice. Point is their food was good but due to the slow service, we couldn't eat much and got tired of waiting. And once it hit 230pm, food service stopped. Surprisingly, the table on our right had all their orders even though they arrive later than us. The table on our left was surprised that table had all their orders fulfilled without any glitches yet we were left hanging on several dishes and had to remind the service staff again and again. There were guests being placed in partitioned tables with a board like in a library. Probably won't go back again during lunch time due to their lack of service."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Review on Shin Minori,-1,30,29-Mar-17,"Food was ok but service was quite bad, was welcomed by the staff upon arrival quite rudely. Waiting time for food was as Long as 30minutes after 1pm."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Okay,-1,30,25-Mar-17,"Went there with the 1-for-1 birthday promo. Price is worth it during the promo but I don't think I would pay the usual price. Food is alright, not fantastic. Sushi is pretty average. Was seated at a very cramped table when there were many empty tables around. Staff probably didn't want to walk and so seated all the customers nearby, putting us in very awkward close proximity."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","The food you ordered did not come. After reminder, have to wait very long. Most of the food tasteless.",-1,10,23-Mar-17,Terrible service. Will be my first n last visit. The service staff not responsive. Pretends to be very busy...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not that gd,-1,10,22-Mar-17,"Variety of food is limited. Taste of food is so-so, definitely not worth the price. Will not go again. With that lunch pricing, I can get a better Japanese restaurant and better food."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Thirsty,-1,20,21-Mar-17,We are thirsty after eating the food. No doubt it is delicious. The waiters also serve food very slow and avoid our eyes contact when we want to order more. What an experience for ala carte ordering buffet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch review,-1,30,21-Mar-17,"Overall experience was ok. Atmosphere was quite decent. Waiters were quite attentive, certain portions of the food were quite small."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",very bad service and food quality,-1,20,20-Mar-17,service and food quality was horrible. me and my friend had a bad stomachache after the buffet lunch.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori,-1,30,20-Mar-17,"I last ate years back. I went back again last week to try again. Variety was quite good, however i would rather pay slightly more and go for hotel buffets. Plain water and tea are chargeable with no desserts and fruits."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet at Shin Minori,-1,30,16-Mar-17,"Food was decent and staff were friendly, helpful and prompt at services. However tables were small and diners were all squeezed at one area of the restaurant, making the place squeezy and noisy not very conducive for a buffet. Aircon didn seem to be working well either."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad service,-1,10,15-Mar-17,The staff can only converse in mandarin. Last order was made known to us at 2130hrs and closing time is 2230 but at 2200hrs their staff were all packed and waiting at main entrance to close the restaurant. Feels so unwelcomed.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh sashimi but poor service,-1,30,13-Mar-17,"The service was slow... We have to wait quite a while before drinks were served or to get the attention of the waiters/ waitresses to check on our missing orders. But the food served was fresh, especially the sashimi."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Irritated by computer calling to confirm appt for so so food. Servixe was good but the food basic. Simple n plain. What,-1,30,13-Mar-17,For common so so food what else can i say. Will go back for basic food. The items remain unchange. Boring items
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Can try,-1,30,12-Mar-17,"Food was serve slow during lunch time. Service with service crew is OK, but the front counter not so welcoming."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,-1,30,10-Mar-17,"Was brought to the table with an attitude problem waiter. The sashimi served was sliced too thick, totally fail if you are in Japan's kitchen"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Treat!,-1,10,8-Mar-17,The Birthday treat wasnt as stated free for Birthday Customer. I was very disappointed on my Birthday n the waitress didnt vertify my NRIC just ask for e voucher n extra party then can have the free treat. Y not just put as 1 for 1 treat not Birthday treat at all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good Service, Average Food.",-1,30,7-Mar-17,"Overall, it was a good experience. The sashimi were fresh and the cooked dishes were average, not bad but nothing amazing about it. We went for the promotion (Free Alaska Snow Crab Nabe with every 2 paying adult for lunch buffet). Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of waiting and inquiring about the waiting time after ordering the Nabe for a couple of times, we were informed that the Alaska Snow Crab Nabe ($32) was not available, which they replaced with the Hotate Chizu Mentaiyaki (5 pcs at $22.00, but we were only given 4 pieces).However, the service staffs were cheery and friendly, which I appreciate very much."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ala Carte Lunch Buffet,-1,20,5-Mar-17,"Food was average or even some was below average.Waiting time for each of the items ordered were at least 30-45 minutes, excluding Sashimis which took 10-15mins for a plate.The waiting time was horrible and there were people around my table asking for their food too. I ordered takoyaki balls, quail eggs, ton katsu and gyoza which took more than an hour to arrive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebration promotion,-1,30,1-Mar-17,"Brought hubby for the 1 for 1 Birthday ala carte buffet promotion. The staffs were friendly and nice. Responded well whenever we need help. Food were average. Due to the crowd, there were some orders which we had placed were not served. Overall nice experience if using the promotion. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average Experience,-1,30,26-Feb-17,Basic sashimi selection. Grilled selection was ok nothing to crow about. We also ordered soup which was a nice change from the usual miso.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only value for money if there's voucher,-1,20,26-Feb-17,"There are varieties of food available but the quality is mediocre. If there's no birthday voucher to be used during this visit, it's not worth your effort and calories to visit this restaurant. Totally has no idea how this restaurant won the best buffet restaurant of the year. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad level of dining experience,-1,10,22-Feb-17,Beware that you need to print out the Chope voucher before you dine as there is zero empathy from the restaurant manager if you don't have the hard copy. We request if we could change seats but was turned down and lastly when we asked if drinks was included in the buffet we were told clearly that only water and green tea was free despite that they will actually charged you for it. When I asked about the charges all I received was a cunning smile that the drinks are not free but FREE FLOW.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and service,-1,30,20-Feb-17,"The food is nice n quite fresh. Because we are having buffet lunch,some of the food we ordered didnt come.and we order again.the service is ok too.the food delivery quite fast."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori dinner,-1,20,18-Feb-17,"Visited on valentines day, restaurant was crowded and couples where separated by wooden dividers. Conversations from other couples could be easily heard and there was no privacy. The food arrived extremely slow(about 20mins waiting time for 2 pieces of sushi) and we did not receive many of the food that we ordered. Moreover, we received servings of food that we did not order. Its understandable that the restaurant may have been busy that's why the food arrive late but how can we be served food that we did not order ourselves? that's hilarious. I dont mean to give a bad review to complain, I really hope shin minori can really up their service standards."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reservation table,-1,20,16-Feb-17,I reservation table for valentine dinner with my wife and we reach there early and they told me even i book it at 8.30pm also does not confirm have table for me. but after 8.30pm we go in and the tablet keep having problem cant order and we only have 45mins to order food all before close and service are lousy keep calling but no one is serveing and we still giving service charge of 15 dollars for nothing. asking for refill have to wait for 1hrs then refill it. ice cream is so smaller then other customer which is early came in for dinner. it is not wroth to come here for dinner with important date. my wife and i was so upset of this yr celebration. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Never returning,-1,10,16-Feb-17,"Horrible waiting time, food not served despite countless request, cold foods, poor quality of food although many choices. Price doesn't match quality of food expected"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money buffet restaurant,-1,30,16-Feb-17,"Overall, Shin Minori proves to be an extremely value-for-money buffet restaurant. Premium cuts of sashimi, together with a wide variety of delectable grilled dishes, sushis, fried dishes, maki! Most of the dishes are above average."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food was good but the ""cleaning lady"" from the kitchen spoilt the entire experience for us.",-1,20,15-Feb-17,"Food was above average and commendable. As was the service given the entire network crashed. It took a half hour before staff efficiently managed ""manually"". we were impressed with how they managed the situation. The evening was a completely loss when the cleaning lady form the kitchen pushed out a trolley load of trash bags and asked me to move. I was seated and still having my dinner. I asked what she meant in disbelief and she shouted in mandarin ""move away."" my partner was so taken aback he stood up and insisted we leave immediately. Sadly, i did not get to finish my dinner. Not quite acceptable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good place for families'/friends' gathering,-1,30,14-Feb-17,Good hangout place for get together. A good variety of food selection but average tasting for food..the food serving time was quite long due to understaffing.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Over rated,-1,30,12-Feb-17,"Food quality is over rated in your review. Except for sashimi, rest of dishes were either too salty or mostly overlooked, non authentic at all"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,-1,30,8-Feb-17,"Serve me soup but didn't provide me with a spoon. Ask for a spoon but I finished my meal already also never come. Ask for bill 3 to 4 times but still didn't come. In the end, I walk up to the counter to pay my bill. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food and ambience poor,-1,20,6-Feb-17,Not a very good experience for ambience. Venue quite run down. Variety of food for the price could be better
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Food Great, Service Poor",-1,30,2-Feb-17,The food was very good and the alarm Carter buffet electronic ordering system easy. However when the food was delivered the server just abruptly dropped the plate at the edge of the table and did not make an effort to place it between the diners. Also clearing plates after they were finished was not done in a timely manner. Nor was the free-flow tea refreshed when the glass was empty. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very poor service,-1,20,1-Feb-17,Utterly disappointed with the restaurant that was branded to be the best buffet restaurant in 2016. Very poor services by the waitresses with rude expressions.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chinese New Year family meal,-1,30,1-Feb-17,Under-staff so the wait for food took longer than expected. The food quality also suffers as a result of the situation
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",CNY Dinner,-1,30,1-Feb-17,Good range of food but service was slow and not all items ordered were delivered to us despite repeated reminders. Surprised to see sashimi was cut into 1-1.5cm thick.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Limited choices for the value we paid,-1,30,31-Jan-17,Visited the restaurant for the 1st time to celebrate my son's 21st birthday but was a big disappointment. The food quality are average n choices limited. Sashima quality are average as well and there are more Jap buffet we visited are of better choices and comparable in price too.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Good sashimi, the cooked food is meh...",-1,30,29-Jan-17,"Loved the sashimi, fresh and delicious....But the cooked food was overcooked and dry. Service was okay...price is exp considering the average quality of the cooked food"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Friendly service but food is average,-1,30,29-Jan-17,"The staff were friendly but the food quality was much lower than expected and the buffet does not even come with any drinks, not even water ... and no desserts either.. a bit disappointing ...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Services,-1,30,27-Jan-17,"Went to have early reunion dinner at shin minori, serving of food was kinda slow due to most probably not enough manpower for servers. Requested water refill but took quite some time to have it served to us. Few of our orders were missed out, waitress came to ask for last order and told that they left out few of our orders, went back to check but never came back and came to ask the second time for last order but we just forget about it instead"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ok food choice,-1,30,26-Jan-17,Food was not thaaat nice. Priced too highly for a single cuisine meal. Lunch was like 40 plus per person? Who would be willing to spend that much on a lunch at such a deserted mall? Price should be reduced to entice more customers
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A Let Down,-1,20,26-Jan-17,"Was looking forward to have a value for money dinner and great company on Tuesday, 24. But was it was a total let down. Thank God the sashimi was fresh and they were generous with their servings. If you are not a sashimi fan, you may wanna give this place a miss. I must say they do have a good variety on the menu for the amount they charge, but.... the bunch of us would rather go for value and quality to variety!Most of the grilled items we ordered were so tiny and dry in texture and some of them are cold!!!! We were sooooo totally mislead by the photos in the menu. Oh ya, if you are conscious of salt intake - this is not the place for you either, their cooked food is en general to the salty side. We wanted to put in a special request but the tablet that has a remarks xolumn doesn't allow us to do so. Food came fast but the service were not up to standard. There were 8 of us with 3 tablets (it is obvious that they have linked the table to fit our number of pax) and we ordered using different tablets. To us, it's basic knowledge or only logical to serve the food to the table where the orders were keyed. But 2 of thier service staff did not do so. They just dumped the food at one side and expect us to pass on. The level of basic service should be up in this. Overall, it was a disappointment for me and it shall be my first and my last to visit this food chain. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi nice,-1,30,26-Jan-17,"Nice food. Though we ordered via the system, we noted there were instances where the food did not arrive."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",average jap buffet,-1,30,24-Jan-17,generally everything was way too sweet.. the good things are you could order by precise pieces so can reduce wastage and try more varierty.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch,-1,30,22-Jan-17,"Good food in general. You place your order on a tablet. Some of the food ordered did not come. When I mentioned this to one of the waiters, he told me to simply place another order. I thus had to wait quite a bit. Some food came twice. When I pointed out that one of the dishes did not seem fresh, the waiter (who seemed senior) gave me a blank look and did not bother to apologise or replace it. I would still go back though."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",So so,-1,30,19-Jan-17,Quite value for money but some items get loss in process of ordering . Worst of all seated next to a family with 2 very disruptive kids
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",food orders did not arrive,-1,30,18-Jan-17,have ordered some food but most of it did not arrive. have to reorder again and yet same issue. service did not clear the table till the food order came.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible,-1,10,17-Jan-17,"Service was terrible, food was over fried and over salted. It took forever for anything we ordered to arrive, and it was cramp and sounded like a fish market. For $10 more, we could have gone to Marriot for their weekend buffet, We are never, ever returning."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,-1,30,17-Jan-17,"Come with a very small serving when you place an order. Waiting time is long. Overall, the price is still not valuable."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",An average dining experience,-1,30,15-Jan-17,"Booked the restaurant from the stellar reviews found online. Thought the food was alright. The sashimi slices were particularly thick but not great. We order a variety of sashimi but felt too full to continued with much of the other cooked dishes. For the same price, I think there are better Japanese buffet restaurants. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average quality fare,-1,30,9-Jan-17,"Decided to visit this joint as I saw that it was voted as one of the best buffet restaurants by Chope. Also, because the entertainer app has 1-1 buffet lunch, I thought it would be worth a try.The food was just average in my opinion though they have quite a good variety of items on the buffet menu. None of the items were exceptionally good, more like mass produced food type of quality. Service was good, the staff was prompt in serving and clearing. The experience reminds me of Nihon Mura. While the value is there, I doubt I will be returning anytime soon."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad front desk receptionist,-1,20,9-Jan-17,Everything else was fine except for the front desk receiptionist whom answered my call. He was extremely rude.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Only sashimi is good.,-1,20,9-Jan-17,Only the sashimi is good. None of the cooked food is nice. Yakitori is either tasteless or sauce too sweet. Bean sprouts teppanyaki is very oily. Sushi is average.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Chope Telephone Reservation,-1,30,8-Jan-17,"The reservation is good but the incessant telephone call through Viber and telephone call is very irritating. After confirming the reservation, the system keeps calling you despite confirming it a few times. It will keep calling until you answer and even is you answer and confirm it, it still keep calling. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good sashimi and sushi,-1,30,7-Jan-17,"Pros:Sashimi cuts were clean and texture of fish was good. Sushis were quite appetising like fried california roll and the eel with cheese ones. However, sadly no salmon belly or aburi unlike Ikoi (another jap buffet). Cons:Most fried food like sashimo and gyoza is not nice. Both of these were underdone and gyoza was too oily. Service was slow (I understand that as the place was almost filled) but towards the end, we sat for about an hour chatting and some items we ordered did not even come. Overall, would only recommend this place for sushi and sashimi. Definitely not the best buffet like what people voted. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Nice Japanese buffet place but lacks punch on the taste,-1,30,3-Jan-17,Was there for lunch to celebrate my gf birthday. Menu variety was ok and ordered food comes quite promptly. But my hamachi sashimi cut was way to thick hehe...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor service,-1,20,1-Jan-17,"Restaurant was packed and I understand that the staff were busy, but that does not mean that they had to be rude. Lots of food order from the buffet menu wasnt served, asked to refill water but was ignored, even the lady manager was rude from the way she spoke. China staff even had to mumble to show that she was displeased when we requested to change seats before being seated. Horrible experience. Sushi and sashimi was okay but cooked food took up to an hour to be served yet served cold. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Inconsistent dining experience.,-1,30,31-Dec-16,"This was my fourth time there. The food has been inconsistent, ranging from good when the restaurant is quiet to overcooked yakitori when the restaurant is crowded. The last visit I went. The restaurant had a company function. Service was slow, inattentive and the food was mostly dry and over-cooked. Not a good experience since I brought my bf's mother there for a treat"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Fresh Food,-1,30,29-Dec-16,"Generally, service staff is courteous. However, serving of food is pretty slow. I had the ala-carte buffet lunch. Honestly i am quite surprised that the price for buffet does not include drinks."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not impressive...,-1,30,28-Dec-16,"3rd visit. Standard seems to have dropped. Bones found in sashimi, and cooked items r disappointing."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Small portions,-1,30,27-Dec-16,Their default portion per serving is small. Not all orders were served. Food is okay. Value for the food is too much
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Terrible service not so fresh sashimi,-1,10,24-Dec-16,"Bad service wanted act blur spoke to him but he just kept walking, tablet broke down, sashimi was not all that fresh! And it was so expensive $50 per person"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow Service and Average Food,-1,20,23-Dec-16,Orders through electronic tablet frequently timed out. Food took a long time to come. Taste quality was mostly average. Called for service through tablet twice for refill and no one responded. Had to finally ask serving waiter to do it.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Please go to other nice Japanese restaurant,-1,10,22-Dec-16,"Food is served in very small amount/quantity. Some food were brought to our table not hot, but super cold. Keep serving wrong food and have to wait quite a long while. Waiters/ Waitresses friendliness depends on your luck that day. Most were rude and cannot be bothered with you. Many people said that their standards dropped. Some grilled food were raw inside.Overall, save your money to go to other Jap restaurants."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner buffet,-1,30,20-Dec-16,"First time trying Shin Minori, there is not much choices for the food. Crew are not friendly at all. Never hit the min standard as a Japanese food restaurant. Bit disappointed!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Missing Food Order,-1,20,19-Dec-16,Some of the food we ordered were not served despite the fact we asked the staff to help us check and confirm that we have indeed placed the order.We have been here several times and we have experienced similar missing orders. But this time is the worst!I think it is time to look for a new place.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",shin minori,-1,30,18-Dec-16,for a buffet oriented restaurant i must say the sahimi items were good and thats only all i can say for this restaurant. short handed on staff as well.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Reasonable spread,-1,30,12-Dec-16,"Ordering system improved much from the last time i visited 3 or 4 months back? Sashimi is fresh! But some items can be done better - 1) cha soba was over cooked that it was soggy. N portion size could be smaller. 2) beansprouts was crunchy and nice but super oily :( Other than that, not much complaints. It was even more worthwhile with the entertainer 1for1 deal. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service was slow,-1,30,12-Dec-16,"Food took long to serve. when we questioned, staff insisted all our orders were out. 2nd time, food was slow too. Took them 3 times to inform us the wine we chosen was sold out n we waited 20 min for it."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Not worth it.,-1,30,12-Dec-16,"Not worth to travel so far to a place which is not convenient. We can have the same quality of food at town. Food choices are limit, and drinks are not included in the package, thus ultimately is more than what you expected."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,-1,30,10-Dec-16,"Standard has dropped since the past few times I went, quite disappointing.
The portions were inconsistent, some way too big, some way too small. Very different from initially."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",A La Carte Buffet Style but Service need Major Improvement,-1,20,7-Dec-16,"A La Carte Buffet Style is good as the food is Hot but order is in a mess, some order is deliver wrong and repeated, some even never come.Chawamushi is very nice!Large group is not recommended as they have only 1 ordering tablet per table."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good and efficient service.,-1,30,6-Dec-16,"This place is quite popular, so I decided to book a day in advance. However, the earliest time slot for the ala cart lunch buffet was 1 pm.Food was ordered thru a tablet which was very easy to use. Service was surprisingly fast despite the crowd. Now the food. The variety and selection was good. Taste wise however is nowhere close. There is really nothing to make one say that wow, I really have to order this the next time I'm here. Nevertheless, it did serve it's function as we were rather hungry at 1 plus pm.Please be warned that last order is at 2. 00. We barely finished the initial order when we were politely told of that. Perhaps it is my fault that I did not notice it on the website when I did the booking. So do book earlier time slots if you like to linger and take your time in eating."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",The rise and fall of service,-1,20,5-Dec-16,"My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary and were looking forward to a wonderful selection of Japanese food and some quality service. Unfortunately, to our dismay, food wasnt great and service was atrocious. They firstly kept getting our orders wrong and till this day we still wonder where our unagi sushi and spider maki disappeared to. They probably eloped and found a nice little home in a hill unbeknown to us. What more, staff didnt seem happy to serve us and we even saw a few of them trying to communicate in mandarin to the Filipino guys beside us, which was puzzling because they clearly could not understand what the service staff were saying. Apart from the sashimi and stir fried beef, everything else tasted like it came from a salt factory, not sure if they were trying to mask the flavours of the food or kill the bacteria in it. The raw squid tasted like they had talcum powder powdered all over it like a baby's rash filled bottom. Definitely not a place for a first date... But maybe your last..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Really Awful Experience,-1,10,3-Dec-16,"Had a really awful experience. Made reservations for 630pm and reached there at 645 pm due to heavy traffic (Standard Chartered Marathon - road closure). Reservations were given away - claimed that our booking was 6 pm instead of 630 pm from their system and they sent SMS confirmation with we did not receive. If we did, we could have changed because it was not what we wanted. Winnie the manager was very adamant - although system is as good as what staff key in (garbage in garbage out) because we booked via phone not internet. No apologies only impoliteness. I would not recommend the place at all neither would my family / and I ever patronise this restaurant. Very poor customer service...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Decent selections,-1,30,1-Dec-16,"Decent selections but not cheap. Costs $80+ after GST. Had to pay for beverage too. Ordering was made easy with tablet but the tablet would restart when you've ordered a certain amount which can be irritating as you would relaunch the app and re order. Quantity was reasonable, small portions for an ala- carte buffet. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday celebrations at Restaurant on Weekend night,-1,30,29-Nov-16,Staff helpful and friendly. Food is on the average side though. Initially had the expectations that us was awesome based on review. Possibly over expectated. Other wise it was decent
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",rigid service with ref to promo voucher,-1,20,16-Nov-16,rigid service with ref to promo voucher. Insist that i print out the voucher for the snow crab soup despite they have extra copies. I have also diwnliaded fron phone snd showed to the chinese malaysian kady supervisor! Soup was eventuslly serve but cold!
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good experience,-1,30,14-Nov-16,"For the food, most of them were delicious and well prepared. Each dish comes in a small portion, which is good because you don't have to eat too much and can order other dishes. If you like that dish, you can always order more anyway. The waiters and waitresses were excellent servers. They are professional and friendly, not to mention interactive. They talk to you and understand your needs, rather than those 'follow the books, scripted words' kind of server. However, when the restaurant gets busier, they attended to us slower and the 'call for service' on their ipad was not working (or they are ignoring it). Atmosphere was okay, nicely decorated, however the seat we got was a window seat and it started to get very warm after a while."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,-1,30,8-Nov-16,"If you are only here for the sashimi, its fresh, thick slice, good range of sashimi. However, other food like the grilled category/ handroll, not very nice. Nothing to rave, but i can say its for sashimi lovers."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Japanese Buffet Lunch,-1,30,2-Nov-16,80% of items are rice/noodles. Sashimi was fresh but always served last. Mentaiko spaghetti was bad. It was obviously pre-prepared & heated up in microwave or something. Grilled/Fried items were a tad too salty.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Slow service, salty food",-1,20,31-Oct-16,"Orders are placed via a tablet and we ended up waiting for 15min to be served. Only the sashimi was served quickly, everything else took really long to prepare and we spent more time waiting for our food than eating. The kitchen also forgot many of our orders. Sashimi was ice-cold in the middle and the grilled dishes were too salty. Would not come back again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor quality food and service,-1,20,31-Oct-16,"I have dined in Shin Mori a year before, which I have had great experience as the service then was good, so was the quality of food.Encouraged by the good experience before, I went back with 2 other friends on last Friday but the experience was a let down.We were not served any drinks for nearly 1/2 an hour. When we waved to the waiters around, one of them took order for green tea but forgot to serve until we reminded him 10 minutes later. The green tea was not even hot upon serving.The shasimi we ordered was not fresh and the hand rolls were not freshly made.This time my overall experience is poor."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food but service is questionable,-1,30,30-Oct-16,"The sashimi and the sushi were nice and fresh. Cuts of sashimi is great unlike some restaurants which are just thin slices. However, the service is terrible. The tablet menu crashes and took a while to recover. The staff were not really around to be called. Ordered food and the items came out in wrong quantity and no one bother letting us know what is what. Had to remind the order is not served. Had to repeat three times and I have to personally walk to the counter to remind. That was after about 30 min of waiting. Impression left on my guest was less to be desired. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money with 1 for 1,-1,30,27-Oct-16,"Was there for a 1 for 1 promotion with UOB credit card. Ambience was cozy with dim lightings and privacy from other diners assured with separators place between the tables. Overall portion between 2 pax is adequate without being overwhelming and all their maki rolls were really tasty. I would recommend the Pumpkin chawanmushi as well. However as they could be understaffed at the moment, getting their attention is quite challenging. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for Money,-1,30,25-Oct-16,"Came here with more than 30 colleagues from different part of Asia when they were here for a training. Service was prompt and cheerful even when the restaurant was full. There was wide range of menu choices. It's value of money so you get what you pay for. Overall, it was a lively atmosphere and everyone enjoyed themselves."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Unhappiness,-1,20,24-Oct-16,"My order list was misplaced, have to wait for 45 min to realise my order form is lost. Feel very disappointed for the service. I feel the service is poor not worth to pay the service charge."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Value for money 1 for 1 buffet lunch,-1,20,22-Oct-16,We had the 1 for 1 buffet under UOB promo.. varieties is good but food was served very very slowly. Ordered the bean sprout and it took 40mins to arrive even though there are only few ppl at that time. Everything need to order via the iPad even for a cup of water and it cost $0.80. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Fresh sashimi, everything else average",-1,30,17-Oct-16,Food was not as good as I remembered from a few years ago. But quality of the sashimi was still good and fresh. Teppanyaki was good in terms of taste but they could be more generous with the quantity per serving. Maki and other sushi were passable to say the least. Nothing memorable. Service was also a little slow - it took awhile for our food to be served and the time lag between dishes was quite long. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Wide food varieties,-1,30,17-Oct-16,"There ain't many Japanese buffet in Singapore and Minori spread considered good. However, as many have commented, indeed their service isn't prompt for it took us to signal a few times before we got attended to. Just 1 incident to highlight - they need to double check to ensure that the ipad is securely fasten. Mine dropped midway through my meal and caused a mess. But they were fast in this aspect of cleaning. It would have improved our dining experience if they would to relocate us to a clean table instead."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant,-1,30,17-Oct-16,"Sashimi was fresh. Other food items - not bad, but not fantastic either.Tablet for ordering was lagged, & then went crushed - resulting in some items ordered but not captured.Had to re-order manually with the service staff.Overall ambience not too bad. Can go? Probably yes - for the experience."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good deal with 1 for 1 card promotion,-1,30,4-Oct-16,Sashimi is of good quality ... Other food that we tasted not as expected ... So just rate overall as average. But the 1 for 1 credit card promo makes it much more worthy of the visit
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad attitude,-1,30,3-Oct-16,"I had a reservation 3 weeks ago before I went there with my friends. I wanted to have the private room so I put down my remarks via Chope reservation system. When I was there, I told the counter staff I had a private room reservation, but they said rudely ""minimum charge for private room usage must be 450++"". It looks like they were worrying I got no money to pay for it. They continue to say ""So you still want the normal dining table reservation or not?"" I have to bear with it , not for anything else but for my friends. My point is it doesn't matter if I can't get the private room / i have to pay for the private room, It is matter that the counter staff doesn't have the basic manner towards guests.IF the owner of the restaurant happened to see this, please give some guidance to your staff on such matters. [UNLESS THE OWNER FEEL THAT THE STAFF WERE CORRECT TO TELL ME OFF.] I remembered that the counter staffs were 1 guy and 1 lady, both uniforms in black. Seems like they are restaurant manager / supervisor. Date of my visit - 30 Sep 2016."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",It was ok,-1,30,2-Oct-16,Went for buffet lunch and the food was served very slowly for all the tables.It was only later that they discovered that orders did not went to the kitchen. It was resolved later on.It wasn't a fantastic experience taking to account what was being reviewed. Variety of food for buffet is not wide in my opinion.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Dinner at shin minori,-1,30,17-Sep-16,"It would be great if desserts we're incorporated into the buffet.
Food is average for a buffet. My friend ordered the fried soft shell crab, small crabs were served at the table."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Weekday dinner,-1,30,17-Sep-16,"Fried items were excellent: crispy, flavorful, juicy, and without a hint oily taste. However, the grilled items were quite disappointing: they were too dry and rather tasteless. Sashimi and maki were rather average. Nevertheless, the service staff was fast, efficient and very courteous. It was surprisingly packed during a weeknight especially since it is not near to an MRT station. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",tablet malfunctioned more than 5 times,-1,30,11-Sep-16,"the tablet thst was attached at table was malfunctioned. it stopped working for more than 5 times and when that happened, all orders entered that hasn't been sent to kitchen will be wiped out. wasted a lot of our time. most food were also very salty. and drinks were chargeable not included as part of buffet "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointment,-1,30,11-Sep-16,Had been to this restaurant many times but it was such a disappointing experience on 9/9/16.The love apple dessert ordered was totally different from the picture on the menu and it taste horrible. My friends also ordered the Green Tea Cheese Cake and it also tasted horrible. Would not recommend my friends there again. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Order went missing,-1,30,11-Sep-16,"A few items ordered was not served even when it was ordered twice, restaurant needs to step up on their tablet ordering system, of diners can get their order served, there would not be duplicate orders and the kitchen would not be jammed."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,-1,30,10-Sep-16,"Food was so-so. Can't pin point which dish I like best in the buffet.
Service was prompt. One of the cashiers was very obliging to split the bill for 8 of us."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Extremely Bad Customer Service,-1,10,4-Sep-16,"Ordered a dish and reminded them 5 times, kept telling me it is coming and after 1.5 hours still did not serve. Frustrated and called for the bill. Most dishes are tiny in size relative to the market standard. As it was ala-carte buffet, they seemed to be deliberate in serving slowly and conveniently did not serve some dishes thinking that people will forget what they ordered."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Our first dining experience at Shin Minori,-1,30,29-Aug-16,"Overall, the food and service are up to our expectations. The only bad experience is finding our way to the building's carpark."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori Jap Restaurant,-1,30,24-Aug-16,"Salmon & Swordfish sashimi was fresh. The tuna was pale & dry. BBQ foods a tad too salty. Overall, acceptable value for the spread. Staff was attentive and pleasant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Third visit but slightly disappointed,-1,30,15-Aug-16,"The sashimi was cut too thick and the tuna sashimi was cut wrongly, with too much veins making it hard to bite."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Slow in ordering,-1,20,8-Aug-16,food did not deliver when order via tablets. have to wait for some time and food delay. not really recommended.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Mediocre for price,-1,20,5-Aug-16,"Sashimi quality average. Ordered tako sashimi but was told they only give tentacles and head only, I will need to order tako sushi if i wanted the sliced ones. Grilled dishes are generally alright. Overall an average Japanese buffet restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Don't waste your time and money here,-1,10,5-Aug-16,"For the amount of money that I'm paying, I would have expected better quality than sakae sushi. Sake sashimi was not fresh enough, tako sashimi was served with head and mini tentacles (not with the usual big slices, which is a first for me). Grilled food were moderate but too salty. Garlic fried rice was fragrant but too oily. Salad was served with too much sesame dressing, the lettuce was dripping with dressing. The restaurant should get their portions right. The best dish here was the plain lettuce. I would not come here ever again. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Very lacklustre ,-1,20,4-Aug-16,High on choice but low on quality for the lunch buffet. The sushi is probably the same quality of those served at Sakae Sushi. Definitely not worth the $34 price tag per head for the buffet. The chuka hotate has to be one of the worst I've ever had. Do note that water is charged at $0.50 at this restaurant. The buffet does not include tea or any dessert. Quite disappointing. 
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average food,-1,30,1-Aug-16,"Nothing fancy to scream about. Sashmi was okay, but the other food are so so. order grill it is almost charred."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average,-1,30,26-Jul-16,"Great atmosphere but average food.
Had the buffet, unfortunately i feel that the food range is not wide enough."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Food passable only,-1,20,18-Jul-16,"When I first entered the restaurant the female assistant manager didn't ask for my reservation but asked the guy behind me instead. When I flag out she was quite rude and said ""so what is your phone number ?"" That was bad attitude like I owe her. Food was ok but not great. Sashimi and sushi were quick but the rest like Gyoza and yakitori were really slow. I strongly recommend The Japanese buffet restaurant at Hotel Royal - much better quality. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Definitely Not Value For Money!!,-1,10,11-Jul-16,"Only the food photos on website looks good, but it is not. One of the worst Japanese ala carte buffet restaurant we (4 adults) have experienced. Website said ""authentic"" Japanese food, which I have my doubts! Our first and last visit. The price does not include the basic drinks i.e. water and/or green tea. Service is bad too. Chefs and waitresses speaks only Chinese, not that I have problem with Chinese, but this is just to highlight to visitors who are non Chinese speaking."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Service,-1,30,4-Jul-16,The food is still up to standard but The service is not there thing we order is not here despite we requested many times
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good variety but don't expect any quality for this price,-1,20,3-Jul-16,"We paid $37++ for 2 (with a one for one promo) for a buffet lunch which was the most I would be willing to pay for the quality of the food here, especially when Robertson Quay is dotted with good quality Japanese restaurants all over. Sashimi - edible but not fresh. Beef and udon - tasted terrible, left them on the table. Chawanmushi was not bad. Yakitori sticks were really poor quality especially the chicken parts (gizzard, heart)... Probably stored frozen for a long time before they were served. My previous visit wasn't as bad as this one as I recall the sashimi used to be a lot fresher. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant..."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Shin Minori,-1,30,26-Jun-16,"The only reason Shin Minori stands out is because of the bang for the buck! Their a la carté buffet is what makes it so special, at only 30-40 Singapore dollars per person. It's absolutely incredible for those who'd just love to stuff themselves up after weeks of sushi cravings! Service wasn't bad for a busy place, food definitely wasn't the best but it's just past satisfying! For a low budget sushi craze, this is exactly what you're looking for."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Buffet Japanese - a la carte,-1,30,26-Jun-16,"The sashimi such as tuna, salmon, sword fish, octopus are thick and fresh. Generally acceptable. But the rest of the food are just mediocre and nothing remarkable to talk about. Salads have too much dressing hence very saltish. Fried vegetables - cabbage too oily. Complimentary salmon fish are served too early even before all guests arrive. The buffet doesn't include drinks - even Japanese tea and water are chargeable. Even though tea can be continuously replenished, but need reminders to fill the teapots."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good food standard but poor customer service,-1,30,20-Jun-16,"This is my second visit to Shin Minori so I've decided to pen down (type down?) my review. Generally the standard of japanese dishes are quite alright. I have to mention some of my favourite/ must-order. Their seafood salad, pumpkin chawanmushi, yakitori electively, sushi selectively as well and garlic fried rice are quite good. What I am unhappy about is their customer service and/or servers attitude. The servers especially a lady in particular typically throw the dish plates onto our table and without saying excuse me while I was tucking in my food over my plates. It happened everytime she serves. This is an ala-carte buffet so you do expect that alot. There was practically no smile on their faces and that include their supervisor/captain if you would call that. The ambience was quite alright but table arrangement was cramp. Price for a weekend lunch buffet is about $40+ inclusive of taxes. Well, I was lucky to be using some promotion so I paid much lesser than that. To conclude, I would say if you are nearby River Valley and craved for some japanese buffet food... Consider trying them, if not I personally would not visit again for the price and service you will be paying for. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Sashimi not fresh,-1,20,19-Jun-16,"Over rating!
There are plenty choice of buffet to try if were to pay these range pricing.
The sashimi cut is thick enough.... However the food is not fresh and worth what we paid.
And the worst is I diarrhea after that meal..."

Eating half way my wife notice that there are some weird smell in it , so i get it from her and have a small taste on it .... to my surprise there are some detergent smell in it ,,,, immediately we ask the supervisor over for some explanation, to our surprise she just told us there are no smell in it and just take it back into the kitchen and just bring us another cup of it to us and ask us to try .... and tell us this is from the same tub. Frankly speaking we didnt bother to try that anymore and just keep quiet from there . But we are very sure we will never go back there any more and will tell our friends about this. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Average food, Understaffed",-1,20,13-Jun-16,Food is of average quality. Rice used in sushi not real Japanese rice and of wrong proportions. Orders were frequently late or did not get served at all.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Poor seats allocation,-1,20,9-Jun-16,"Well we booked a table for 2 pax through Chope but they did not receive the booking. When we got there, the restaurant was pretty empty and when we saw the table the waiter was bringing us, which was next to a wall and a table top acting as a partition from the next table; the neighbouring table was just right next to us.We asked if we can have another table near the windows to have a bit more privacy. The waiter said they were reserved. Throughout the whole night, nobody came for those tables. I just thought that since its a quiet Wednesday, the waiter should have given us a better table instead of lying to us that those table were reserved."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad quality of food,-1,20,6-Jun-16,"Bad quality of food.
Cramped environment. Not advisable for family with more than 1 child.
Badly lit.

Not advisable for big"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",meal at shin minori,-1,20,31-May-16,The tablet system in the restaurant is very poor. A few times the order we sent to the kitchen did not get registered. We had to keep ordering and spent a lot of time waiting. A waste of time. Will not go there again! Very disappointed
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointed,-1,20,30-May-16,"Went there for the first time and came out with disappointment. Was told that their online food order system is down. Given a piece of paper to write down our orders but the number of pens that are provided are limited. Eventually the customers next to our table lent us their pen. Waited for half an hour for the 1st dish to be served. The food are served very slowly. Almost waited for another half an hour for the 2nd dish to be served. The orders that we have made didn't turn up eventually and the dishes that we didn't ordered was served. Waitresses and waiters were dashing here and there panicky. Service can be better if the waiters and waitresses can be more polite when taking orders and acknowledge the customers' requests. Eg: I wanted to refill the hot green tea, the waitress came, listened to me and walked away without saying anything or nodding the head. Waitresses did bump into when they walked pass and they didn't apologized. When they are asked about the dish they are serving, the answers i got all the time is ""I don't know"" or ""I have no idea"". Food is so so. I'm pretty sure I can pay the same amount of money and get a better food and service in other japanese buffet restaurant."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Worst dining experience!,-1,10,30-May-16,"The place was extremely noisy and there were drunkards shouting loudly but no service staff bothered to address that. Had to place my orders FOUR times but the food still did not arrive. Service was bad and we were not allowed to order additional Ala Carte food even though we are paying for that. Spent $165 for 2 servings of sashimi, 2 bowls of plain udon, 3 sets of sushi, 2 servings of vegetables and 4 chicken wings! The rest of the food never arrived. A most horrible dining experience ever!"
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",so-so only,-1,30,27-May-16,second time visit the outlet cos of the 1 dine 1 free promo...the slots are in 90mins blocks fixed so we cant choose our time to dine... my only issue is with the tako sashimi...its not the same as wats advertised...they served basically small whole tako...not those big n sliced up type...there are better restaurants to dine in this price range...n the place is quite cold for me...
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Terrible Experience,-1,10,27-May-16,"Made a booking at 8pm and came earlier. Waiter mentioned that restaurant is fully booked and insisted to give us the counter seat. There were several empty tables around until 8pm. No table seats were given to us at 8pm, worse still the bbq counter caught fire, there were alot of smoke, no contingency plan to move us to other table, only after a good'o 15mins they decided to move us to an empty table.Over at the new table, electronic food transfer was not done properly and some of our food is missing. Period."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Serving timing need improvement ,-1,30,11-May-16,"Visited on 11thMay2015 with my mother for lunch buffet,where I got an 1 for 1 as I using The Entertainer App. Reached 12pm.As my 1st time here so not sure,which I could ordered. Luckily, there was this lady,she guided me all the way and answered my many questions.Like its garlic fried rice,fried chicken chunks,potato salad,etc...Every items is in small portion,for example 1pc per serving. So when we ordered must take note of the serving size. And find the serving timing is slow,might be restaurant 95% full during lunch time.Overall, beside finding that they should speed up their serving time of each dishes as not only my table but others tables also waited quite long time. Another is their serving portion is too small but menu photo shown is like 2 or 4 per item. But can add on items without extra charge as is buffet. Will still visit as this 1 for 1 deal is great.Would like to compliment the lady wearing black blouse,she always stand at reception,she is patient to all my wonders. Spend $47.08 for 2 as I ordered hot green tea × 2=$3(no drink included in the buffet).The lunch buffet is $37 per pax before tax."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Birthday Dinner,-1,30,1-May-16,First time there and according to Yahoo information it is top 20 Japanese restaurant. I doubt it as the foods provided is just average. Don't have the WOW factor. It is located in UE Square and the place is quiet on weekend.The restaurant is full house. The food is order via tablet with picture indicating your selection. The serving is a bit slow as it depend the numbers of customer ordering it. The chef will prepare those with many orders. Kimchi i also being served in this Japanese restaurant.I don't think I will recommend people to patronize the outlet.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",JOKE RESTAURANT,-1,10,13-Apr-16,"We arrived at 09:15 and choose the buffet option, at 21:30 the kitchen closed but the waiter didn´t say anything about that, they only came with the bill and said ""pay and go we are closing"", we expected to get some refund some part but not they only say I´m sorry. So we had to go to other place a re-dinner because we were hungry. Besides the quality of the food is soo poor and the service is stressfull, they are not japanese they are chinese."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Horrible dining experience,-1,20,12-Apr-16,"Asked for physical menu but never get it throughout my dinner (approx. 1.5hr). Not much variety to choose and food served extremely slow that we forgot what we've ordered. Taste wise, so-so. Some are too salty, some are too blend. Horrible. Would not recommend this place to others."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Good Food but Rushed Service,-1,30,10-Apr-16,"Food was good; sashimi fresh and generous. Grilled items done well and crispy. However the handrolls were not well done. Seaweed was soggy. However do note that the buffet has 2 sessions. 1130-1pm and 1-230pm. They should make this known earlier. Also, the UOB 1 for 1 promo is only for 1 pax per table. This should also be made known earlier."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Disappointing!,-1,10,6-Apr-16,"First impressions were bad when the Manageress took us to a cramped 2 seater table with a large partition blocking our view of the rest of the restaurant although it was early and the place was still empty. Ordered the buffet for 2 and fairly quickly received but can tell this food was pre-made in the kitchen. Edamame cold, chawanmushi cold, kimchi fried rice hot but it was taken out of oven coz bowl was baking hot. The sushi is the only saving grace of this place as sashimi and maki rolls are good standard. After that it was downhill once their EPOS ordering system broke down. No more food came out of the kitchen for over 45 minutes wait and table after table complaints. Manageress panicking and avoiding customers with no Plan B if something like this happens. This place failed tonight purely because of an over reliance on an ordering system and lack of contingency plan as well as weak management. One of the waiters can just laugh out loudly when it broke down and the Manageress in verbal panic mode. Seriously, you guys should not be in this business. We walked out after they offered that we did not have to pay for the bill."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Bad experience ,-1,20,6-Apr-16,"Very disappointed the moment we were sat on a miserable small table at 1 corner though we arrive early n the restaurant was still empty. We had buffet n every order took at least 20min to come which is quite ridiculous. Next problem the samsung pad ordering system was down and no one came to assist us til we manage to catch hold of 1 waitress to help us do manual ordering. I think the manager is doing a great job to lead the team instead trying to avoid customers to avoid problem?? I would definitely not reccomend any of my friends here, seriously is the worst Japanese restaurants I have been so far. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Ok food, not worth the price, especially with the terrible service",-1,20,13-Mar-16,"Average japanese food. At the prices on their menu you would expect much better service. Instead, like a cheap diner, the customer has to order through a tablet. The tablet is not user friendly nor intuitive. My sister had an entertainment 2 for 1 sashimi voucher, which made the price affordable (but we still paid close to $80 in total for the two of us). We did have leftover food, but the restaurant refused to let us take this home unless we paid an extra $15 charge!!! "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Lunch buffet,-1,30,19-Feb-16,"Came here for lunch this week to try the lunch buffet. There's a reasonable selection of sashimi, sushi and typical Japanese dishes. Food quality was ok without being exceptional. Service was a bit haphazard and we had a few minor glitches with the Samsung tablets. Used the Entertainer app to get a 1:1 deal and at that price per person this represents reasonable value. Not sure I'd visit again at full price."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Out of the way, normal but yet pricey for that",-1,20,13-Feb-16,"We were looking for a place for a feast on 1st January 2016, New Years Day, I proposed going for Japanese food so we decided to give Shin Minori a try after looking around for Japanese food.We checked the price $39++ for dinner on public holiday, price seemed alright.We had alot of food but only the sahimi is of quality.At the end of our dinner, we were told that our dinner is $49++, we didn't question the bill much until now. Maybe Shin Minori can kindly address this discrepancy in pricing.Another thing is we waited for quite some time before our food arrived, given that the restaurant is almost empty.Thanks."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Ended on Sour Note ,-1,20,2-Feb-16,"After a generally ok meal and experience, we had already paid and were walking about 50m away from the restaurant when one of the service staff shouted all the way from the restaurant door asking if we had paid. That was embarrassing and appalling on so many counts. Firstly, he could have asked his fellow staff first before shouting so loudly for everyone to hear, making it seem like we were evading our bill. Secondly, he could have come out to ask us face to face instead of shouting if he had wanted to clarify with us. Food wise, some were good some were average. Wide variety for the buffet, ranges from sushi to soba to rice and more. Service was generally ok and efficient enough. The restaurant uses a tablet for buffet ordering. Was going to give an Average rating until that appalling experience. "
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",Average or below average,-1,30,14-Jan-16,The price you pay VS the quality of food. sometimes it is just not justified. I have visited better restaurants. The service is bad. You can be waiting for 10 minutes or even longer and the staff would not have attended to you. Quality of food Vs the price is just not worth the stomach estate. I hope the work on the quality of food and service. considering that i is almost $42-45 per pax.
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore",VERY AVERAGE,-1,30,2-Jan-16,"Went on new year's eve 2015. ""Choped"" a table for 2 with my husband. Restaurant did call the day before to confirm my reservation at 7.45pm. Service was not bad though my ice green tea-paid a dollar but refillable wasnt refilled till i asked but maybe cos it was pretty packed esp on ph eve so i m ok with it n the servers were pretty friendly too. But food is truly average not worth the $49++ per pax buffet - alot of sushi n few other items like fried tofu etc but frankly is it worth $49++?? Na...."
Japnese,"Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant, Singapore","Above average food, below average service",-1,30,4-Dec-14,"I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and used their birthday promotion voucher. I brought along the email printout as the voucher stated which was actually required (I was lucky that I played safe instead of just using soft copy).The place is located at UE square which would require about 20 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT. But I would highly suggest wait for bus 54 just outside the Central. The ride will take at most 5 minutesThe food is above average. I especially like the sashimi moriwase and you can tell the difference from the quality of sashimi in cheaper restaurants such as the popular Sushi Express. The only horrible tasting food is probably their cold pumpkin dish. I also like that we can order from their tablet instead of having to call the service staff. This definitely helps reduce the service time and inconvenience of calling the staff. It will be helpful if the system could help tracked which order has been fulfilled, especially I usually order a lot in one goThe main issue lies with the service. There were only a few customers (3 tables occupied) during the time I was taking my birthday lunch, but it took me effort (at one point I almost have to shout) to get the attention of the staff. The staff lacked smiles also especially when we proceed with our payment.The boss definitely needs to train his staff in terms of service quality or else they will lose more customers. Singapore is a country where service buys you more customers compared to food quality when it comes to more expensive foodI would come back if there is another cheap promotion, otherwise at its default price, it is not really worth it due to their below average service quality and not so convenient location."
